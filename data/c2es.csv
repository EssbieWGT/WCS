Policy recommendations CREA and PACS propose the following policy recommendations to expedite the implementation of President Xi’s 2021 pledge to phase-out China-backed overseas coal projects, including but not limited to:","More than four years after President Xi Jinping pledged to end China’s financing of overseas coal projects, the annual assessment from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and the People of Asia for Climate Solutions (PACS) finds that while some progress has been made, the rise of privately owned off-grid captive coal projects for industrial needs, particularly in Indonesia and Africa, is a growing concern.

While many coal plants have been cancelled, others continue to move forward, especially privately funded, off-grid projects for industrial use, revealing that implementation gaps and loopholes persist.

The assessment analyses five categories — cancelled; pre-permitted; permitted; under construction; operational — and adds a new project category that has emerged this year for idle plants that could return to service at any time without entering a formal permitting process: mothballed.

As of July 2025, the total capacity of overseas coal projects in the pipeline has dropped to 31.4 gigawatts (GW), down from nearly 50 GW in 2024. Cancellations have also accelerated, after a slowdown in 2024, with 16.4 GW of new capacity cancelled in 2025. Since the 2021 pledge, a total of 59.3 GW of projects have been cancelled, which is equivalent to 6.1 billion tonnes of avoided lifetime carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions.

Despite these positive trends, operational projects have grown by 4.1 GW in 2025. Most of these projects were under construction in 2024 or about to be commissioned, demonstrating that once a plant enters the construction stage, it is unlikely to be cancelled.

Although the pace of construction has slowed in 2025, 12.1 GW of capacity remains under construction across 14 projects. These consist largely of captive coal projects in Indonesia, India, Laos, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. These are off-grid facilities that serve industrial needs and are owned by private Chinese companies. This loophole casts a growing shadow over the progress made in ending China’s overseas coal investments. See report annex for further details in the field studies.

To-date, China’s overseas captive coal projects have added an estimated 1.5 billion tonnes of lifetime CO₂, which comes to almost half of all emissions currently in operation. The current projects under construction could add a total of around 3.4 billion tonnes of potential lifetime CO₂ emissions upon completion.

For another, elements of Trump’s industrial policy are a recipe for abuse and corruption.","In recent months, Donald Trump’s administration has supplemented its globe-spanning tariffs with bespoke industrial policy deals with U.S. corporations. These include the federal government taking equity stakes in Intel, a “golden share” in U.S. Steel, and profit sharing on Nvidia and AMD’s chip sales in China. The deals have astonished and unnerved economic analysts across the political spectrum. Commentators from The Wall Street Journal editorial page to MSNBC have decried them as “unprecedented” and amounting to “socialism,” “corporatism,” or “state capitalism with American characteristics.”

In truth, Trump’s actions are rooted in a long history of presidents from both parties taking temporary control or ownership of systemically important companies. However, until now, most of these interventions have been temporary and involved either wartime emergencies or too-big-to-fail corporate collapse. Under Woodrow Wilson, the federal government took temporary ownership of the railroad industry to support troops during World War I. During World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration directed much of the corporate industrial sector. In 1980, Jimmy Carter’s administration extended loan guarantees to Chrysler in exchange for stock warrants. After the company recovered and repaid its loans, the government earned $311 million in capital gains. During the financial crisis, Barack Obama’s administration provided the auto industry with tens of billions of dollars in exchange for equity stakes and commitments for substantial restructuring.

Trump’s moves also build on recent industrial policy interventions by his and Joe Biden’s administrations. Until now, those policies stopped short of the government seeking direct influence over corporate governance through golden shares or equity stakes. During his first term, Trump primarily conducted industrial policy through targeted tariffs and trade actions to promote American industry, and by jawboning corporations to boost domestic manufacturing. The Biden administration went further, providing computer chip and clean energy companies with hundreds of billions of dollars—and detailed requirements for how they could be spent—as part of a long-term post-neoliberal industrial strategy for national security. Those actions were consistent with, though a major step beyond, Trump’s first-term trade policies, just as Trump’s second-term corporate dealmaking is an advance on Biden’s (even if neither president would admit it).

So, while Trump’s dealmaking spree is not unprecedented, it ventures into new territory reflecting his strongman tendencies: He has claimed for himself concentrated power to oversee and influence corporate decision-making, authority thus far ceded to him by Congress and the courts. He has operated outside the law through handshake deals that corporations often cannot afford to refuse, endowing the presidency with powerful—and dangerous—economic tools for routine use.

This is unlikely to be a mere Trump-era aberration. Presidents typically don’t forego inherited powers. Today’s novelty policies may become tomorrow’s precedent, as the last decade has shown. Some elements of industrial policy with Trumpist characteristics may become long-term features of American governance. But Congress and the judiciary should assert democratic and constitutional control over American industrial policy now and in the future to prevent its abuse and, potentially, its collapse.

Here’s a rundown of Trump’s corporate dealmaking thus far:

U.S. Steel: In June, the White House greenlit Nippon Steel’s takeover bid for the American steelmaker U.S. Steel. Trump overturned Biden’s blocking of the deal—on the condition that the government receive a “golden share” of the company, allowing it to veto major corporate decisions, such as offshoring jobs and closing plants.

MP Materials: In July, the Department of Defense announced an investment in MP Materials, the country’s only active producer of certain rare earth minerals used for military equipment. The deal provided government support for the company, guaranteeing a minimum price for its products and providing a guaranteed buyer—the federal government—for all its output for the next 10 years. The feds also extended a $150 million loan and purchased $400 million in company stock, making it MP’s largest shareholder.

Japan: Also in July, the White House announced a trade deal with Japan that purportedly included Tokyo creating a $550 billion investment fund for the administration to use toward its industrial policy priorities, including energy infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, critical mineral supply chains, pharmaceutical production, and shipbuilding. Japan quickly contested the administration’s description of the deal, explaining that the investment fund would be nearly entirely composed of loans the U.S. would need to repay.

Nvidia and AMD: In August, the administration agreed to allow the semiconductor makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell certain modified chips in China, reversing national security restrictions. The companies also agreed to give 15 percent of all profits earned in China to the U.S. government.

Intel: Later that month, the administration took a 10 percent equity stake in the chipmaker Intel. The deal converted billions of dollars in grants the company was due under the CHIPS and Science Act into equity stakes, making the federal government Intel’s largest shareholder. That conversion also, without any legal authority, dispensed with CHIPS Act taxpayer safeguards that required Intel to reach milestones toward completing new domestic manufacturing sites to receive federal funding.

Trump’s economic interventions bear a number of distinctive qualities that expand on industrial policy precedent, but five stand out.

1. Unilateralism: Trump’s industrial policy has been personalist, flowing from and controlled by the president himself. Unlike the Biden administration, which shepherded industrial policy bills through Congress, Trump relies exclusively on executive action. His industrial policy has at times been colored by favoritism and personal relationships. The Nvidia export agreement, for instance, came after meetings between Trump and CEO Jensen Huang. The president himself asked Huang for a share of the company’s Chinese profits. In other cases, bargained-for benefits have been structured to accrue directly under Trump’s control. The Nippon Steel agreement gave control of the golden share not to the office of the president but to Trump himself; only after he leaves office does the share transfer to the secretaries of treasury and commerce. Finally, the (contested) $550 billion pot from Japan would be, according to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, a fund to be spent however Trump wished—part of “a national security and economic fund managed by Donald Trump.”

2. Public ownership in the absence of a fiscal crisis or national security justification: While direct government ownership of industry is not unheard of in American history, the Trump administration has been uniquely eager to wield it as a routine industrial policy tool. The MP Materials and Intel deals both gave the government equity ownership of private companies, and the U.S. Steel approval netted the government special, powerful veto rights over that company’s decision-making. After announcing the (contested) terms of the Japan trade deal, administration officials even contemplated using the deal’s (disputed) investment fund to build government-owned factories that could then be leased to private companies.

3. Bullying individual companies: Trump has a quid pro quo mentality of wanting a cut of any private gains he feels he has facilitated—he has openly compared his presidential dealmaking to waiving property rights on his real estate for the benefit of a third party, in exchange for a fee. When he agreed to grant Nvidia export licenses to sell modified chips in China, Trump told its chief executive, “If I’m going to do that, I want you to pay us something.” Or as Lutnick described the Intel equity stake, “If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.”

4. Leveraging government power: Beyond just flexing the rhetorical might of the presidential bully pulpit, Trump has used the levers of government to offer firms deals they can’t refuse. The administration has created or exploited bargaining power to induce targeted firms to relent to its demands. Under export control regulations, Nvidia and AMD needed the administration’s permission to sell chips in China, forcing them to acquiesce to Trump’s profit-sharing demand. Nippon Steel could not take over U.S. Steel without approval from the government’s foreign investment review committee. Shortly before Intel agreed to the equity deal, Trump ratcheted up the pressure by calling for its executive to be fired and withholding its CHIPS Act grants.

Two other examples illustrate Trump’s leverage power plays. In May, he issued an executive order instructing pharmaceutical companies to agree to adhere to “most-favored-nation price targets … to bring prices for American patients in line with comparably developed nations.” The order threatened that the administration would put the squeeze on pharmaceutical companies that don’t comply, through newly authorized competition from drug imports, restrictions on their own exports, antitrust scrutiny, reconsideration of FDA approvals of their drugs, and loss of National Institutes of Health grants. And in August, the administration announced that it would impose high tariffs on semiconductor imports—but would exempt tech companies that made new domestic investment pledges. The administration thus imposed tariffs to create leverage and offered relief from those tariffs to advance its industrial policy goals.

5. Legally dubious boundary pushing: Much of Trump’s industrial policy has operated in legal gray zones. To bypass routine federal contracting and procurement laws that typically require competitive bidding, the administration’s investment in MP Materials relied on a little-used provision of the Defense Production Act authorizing transactions “without regard to the limitations of existing law.” Trump’s profit-sharing deal with Nvidia and AMD flouts prohibitions on export taxes and fees under both the Constitution and federal law. There is also no firm legal basis under the CHIPS Act to convert Intel’s grants into equity (nor was there to withhold its grants in the first place).

Trump has avoided legal constraints by relying on “regulation by deal,” rather than legislation or agency rulemaking. (He’s also been firing the regulators who would otherwise shape such government interventions.) Companies have acquiesced to White House demands that may not otherwise withstand legal scrutiny to avoid lost business opportunities, the cost and time of litigating against the federal government, and the general ire of the Trump administration. This has insulated much of Trump’s industrial policy from administrative procedure, due process, and judicial review.

Some elements of Trump’s approach are likely to endure. The wraparound support for MP Materials, for example, could well become a model for how the U.S. government cultivates strategically important domestic production. The type of golden share Trump obtained in U.S. Steel could be on the table for future mitigation agreements between the federal government and foreign companies seeking to invest in critical domestic sectors.

As I have written for this magazine, there are also compelling reasons for the government to insist on a direct return on its industrial policy investments. Taking equity stakes in semiconductor companies funded by the CHIPS Act was originally a Bernie Sanders proposal. When used in the right context, equity stakes ensure that industrial policy returns upside revenue to the public, instead of merely socializing profits for corporations.

External trends may also lend Trump’s industrial policy approach greater staying power. As policymakers seek new revenue sources beyond traditional taxation, they may increasingly look to levers like equity stakes, profit-sharing agreements, and royalties. Congress’s tendency toward gridlock and paralysis has long spurred administrations to seek creative executive workarounds, but the courts have increasingly limited the discretion given to the administrative state. That may steer administrations toward regulation-by-deal as a flexible means for the executive branch to regain power from the judiciary.

It’s not hard to imagine where Trumpist industrial policy may be headed. White House advisers have said they will seek equity stakes in other companies receiving federal grants and loans to seed a sovereign wealth fund. Moreover, if Intel cannot right its ship, it may be forced to revisit previous discussions of spinning off its semiconductor factories to a foreign firm like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The Trump administration, which has opposed such a move, could, as Intel’s largest shareholder, dictate the terms of such a deal. (Indeed, the Intel agreement included a poison pill to stymie the sale of its foundries.) Plus, any such sale must win the administration’s approval through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. One could imagine the administration negotiating on economic and national security grounds for government ownership of Intel’s factories, which could then be leased to another chipmaker.

Trump’s industrial policy toolkit may empower future administrations with different priorities. For instance, federal policies—steep tariffs and national security exclusions—are sparing U.S. automakers from a flood of low-cost, cutting-edge Chinese electric vehicles. A future administration could condition that continued industry protection on American carmakers offering more affordable low-emissions vehicles and ramping up their research and development investments.

A future administration could use the specter of the government’s statutory powers to limit or override patents on federally funded technologies to negotiate long-term profit-sharing agreements with artificial intelligence companies. It could also use similar authority to negotiate price reductions from pharmaceutical companies and leverage the Medicare Advantage market to acquire golden shares in health insurance companies, with veto power over major corporate decisions.

A future Democratic administration could grant targeted tariff reductions to countries or companies that decarbonize their energy grids and production processes—and dangle extra reductions to those that use American-made clean energy technology. It could use the Defense Production Act’s preemption power to expedite clean energy and new housing development around other legal impediments. If the industrial policy arc from the first Trump administration to the Biden administration is any guide, the next Democratic president will make fulsome use of these kinds of Trump-inspired tools.

So sheer inertia may well propel Trumpist industrial policy forward. But there are several stark and urgent reasons Congress and the courts should pump the brakes and reconsider major elements of Trump’s approach. For one, this approach may simply yield worse industrial policy. Absent exceeding care and deliberation, go-it-alone executive branch industrial policy can overreach and implode without the safeguards and democratic legitimacy of operating through Congress. Even if Trump’s deals successfully evade the courts, a subsequent administration could deem some contrary to law and declare them null and void—regulation by deal has far less long-term durability than regulation by regulation, let alone legislation. Such whipsawing will make the U.S. government a less reliable, more tumultuous economic actor.

For another, elements of Trump’s industrial policy are a recipe for abuse and corruption. Pay-to-play regimes for exporting sensitive technologies to foreign adversaries jeopardize fair competition and national security. Personalist policymaking is a recipe for cronyism, corruption, and favoritism for well-connected dominant firms. As The New York Times reported, Trump’s family was directly benefiting from billions of dollars of investment in its crypto company by the United Arab Emirates—at the same time it agreed to provide the UAE with highly sensitive and valuable advanced semiconductor chips.

It is all too easy to foresee more future gambits redounding to the private benefit of the Trump family (like the Paramount merger with Skydance, which routed $16 million into the Trump presidential library). Moreover, while leverage can be useful for achieving policy aims, marshaling the vast regulatory state as one big pressure cooker to coerce concessions from targeted companies risks undermining other vital policy interests. We’re already seeing that regarding antitrust. Companies seeking merger approvals have won favorable treatment from the Trump administration by making side promises for domestic manufacturing investments. The potential for Trumpist misuse of industrial policy risks poisoning the whole enterprise.

That’s where Congress and the courts come in—or where they should. Congress was a true coequal branch during the Biden administration’s major industrial policy programs, shaping and passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act through normal legislative processes. It could again instill democratic prerogatives and guardrails for industrial policy. Congress could determine when the government should take equity stakes in private companies. It could set ground rules around taking golden shares, like which corporate decisions may be subject to a government veto and which are off-limits. It could set standards around appropriate uses of revenue-sharing deals with the federal government. It could stipulate where the revenue generated from industry policy investments should go and how it should be spent. It could set rules preventing the government from unduly favoring companies where it has taken equity stakes in competitor firms. It could establish safeguards to ensure that industrial policy is not used to enrich public officials. Meanwhile, the courts may need to revisit legal doctrines like standing to ensure that some party can contest deals of questionable legality, like the Nvidia revenue-sharing agreement or the Intel equity swap.

If Congress fails to act, it could be understood as blessing Trump’s mode of industrial policy by one-man dealmaking. That doesn’t just invite corruption, but is also a recipe for managerial disaster. The Obama administration’s masterful overhaul of Detroit is arguably less remembered today than the failure of Solyndra. After receiving an Energy Department loan, the solar panel firm’s bankruptcy led to a series of high-profile investigations that ultimately uncovered no criminal wrongdoing or corruption but soured the public on Obama’s nascent clean energy industrial strategy.

With Trump’s state capitalism, the hands-off market fundamentalism era is over. The question is whether the government’s new terms of engagement with industry will be dominated by the president or deliberated on by Congress and the courts. Acquiescence by the other branches to Trump’s deals, warts and all, risks heralding the unchecked and unbalanced industrial policy of the unitary executive. Activation by them, however, could lead to a whole-of-government effort to sand away the roughest edges of Trump’s approach to craft an industrial policy that is both powerful and responsible to effectively guide the country forward.",https://washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Nov-25-IndustrialPolicy-Dodge.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 19:18:14.017369

The IRA didn’t just spur investment in battery manufacturing; it helped create over 133,000 decent blue-collar jobs in battery production in just two years.
The nascent American battery industry hasn’t had enough time to relocate its supply chain.","In July, Donald Trump’s administration announced a staggering 93.5 percent tariff on Chinese graphite—a material essential to battery production. China not only dominates graphite mining but also controls 96 percent of the global supply of processed anode-grade graphite, a key component of lithium ion batteries. The move sent shockwaves through the already fragile battery supply chain and all but guarantees higher costs for U.S. manufacturers. It’s only the latest in a string of irrational policies that make it harder, not easier, to bring manufacturing back home.

This summer, congressional Republicans passed the president’s massively unpopular budget bill, rolling back Joe Biden’s signature clean energy legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While much of the attention on the bill’s energy components has focused on the damage to the wind and solar industries, the legislation will also upend the booming battery business, gutting one of the economy’s fastest-growing and strategically vital industries. While the Biden administration made substantial progress in building a domestic battery supply chain, Trump is kneecapping battery manufacturing in the U.S. by crushing demand and hiking up input costs.

The contradictions in Trump’s “America First” strategy are hard to miss: The White House pushes policies to streamline critical minerals production while dismantling the industries that need such minerals; it taxes essential imports without supporting adequate domestic replacements; and it proclaims its mission to bring back American manufacturing jobs while enacting policies that shut down factories.

America’s clean energy transition cannot be stopped, but it can be slowed. Trump and the Republicans have decided to do just that—even if it means fewer jobs, higher prices, and more energy dependence.

The industrial policies passed under Biden ushered in a resurgence in American manufacturing by employing carrots (tax credits) and sticks (tariffs and domestic content requirements). The IRA, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and the CHIPS Act jump-started a clean energy boom, using targeted public investment to catalyze trillions in private capital.

The Biden administration strategically designed an industrial policy for batteries. Tax credits “derisked” investment and improved the cost-competitiveness of domestic battery manufacturing, while Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) provisions penalized companies that continued to rely on imported battery components. Those restrictions were set to tighten gradually, giving American firms more time to build out a domestic supply chain.

It worked. According to the Clean Investment Monitor, Biden’s green industrial strategy tripled quarterly investment in clean manufacturing from 2022 to 2025. Since the IRA was passed, more than 380 clean tech factories have been announced, with 161 already operational. Of the $115 billion in manufacturing investment the IRA attracted, batteries led the way, accounting for 69 percent. In a short time, the Biden incentives made U.S. battery production cost-competitive with China—which dominates over three-quarters of the global battery supply chain—and put the nation on track to meet all of domestic battery demand with a Made in America battery manufacturing industry by 2030.

But then the Republican Party returned to power.

Trump’s signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed in July, guts the tax credits that help American manufacturing catch up to China, while his administration continues to impose tariffs in a blunderbuss manner. The main outcome of this so-called economic “strategy” will be higher inflation and persistent shortages of foreign goods and commodities. And the effects of Trump’s tariffs are only beginning to reach consumers.

Since Trump’s inauguration, more than $27 billion of investment in clean energy manufacturing has been canceled, bankrupted, delayed, or scaled back, taking nearly 19,000 jobs. More EV manufacturing facilities, including battery plants, were canceled in the first three months of 2025 than in all 2023 and 2024 combined.

The elimination of the EV tax credit and the EPA’s move to rescind Biden-era tailpipe emissions regulations deals a blow to EV adoption, but it will cripple America’s battery manufacturing. A report by Princeton’s ZERO Lab estimates that not only could these repeals result in the cancellation of an eyepopping 100 percent of planned battery facilities, but they also potentially threaten to shut down up to 72 percent of battery manufacturing plants. Withdraw market incentives, and the market dries up. EV sales could also fall 30 percent by 2027 and 40 percent by 2030. That translates to 8.3 million fewer EVs, and 8.3 million fewer batteries needed to power them.

The IRA didn’t just spur investment in battery manufacturing; it helped create over 133,000 decent blue-collar jobs in battery production in just two years. Within the first five months of Trump’s presidency, more than 6,000 of those jobs were wiped out.

With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, the nonpartisan energy policy think tank Energy Innovation projects that 31,000 battery jobs will evaporate by 2030. But the more profound tragedy is the number of American jobs—approaching 1 million—in manufacturing, supporting industries, and local economies that will now never materialize.

These aren’t workforce reductions for a dying industry. They are layoffs in the sectors of tomorrow—cuts to a technology that makes a more resilient, affordable energy system for America possible.

Trump and the GOP are doubling down on fossil fuels as the economics of renewables—even paired with the costs of battery storage—make that strategy irrational. Batteries absorb electricity during the day while prices are low and discharge it during peak demand hours, improving grid reliability and cutting energy costs for consumers.

Look at Texas, the country’s largest deregulated electricity market, where battery storage is booming to take advantage of dirt-cheap solar power. The growth of solar and batteries there has significantly reduced the risk of grid emergencies for which the Lone Star State had become infamous. Solar provides power during the hottest hours of the day, while batteries store the excess and release it as the sun sets. In California, where battery capacity has exploded 30-fold since 2018, record discharges of battery power during last year’s extreme heat meant that the state didn’t need to issue a single energy conservation alert.

Ironically, battery storage provides precisely the type of dispatchable energy that Trump administration officials claim they want. A recent report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, a nonprofit regulatory authority that sets and enforces grid reliability standards, found that battery expansion improved overall grid reliability even as the rapid uptake of data centers increases strain on the system.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has pulled support for long-duration battery storage projects and cut funding for scientific research into advanced battery technologies. As one former senior Department of Energy official told The Guardian, “If you stop any research for next generation solar or battery technology, or wind or geothermal or other pieces, what you’re effectively doing is compromising a huge range of technology that has the potential to reduce costs.”

For all its talk about American energy dominance and lower prices, raising energy costs is exactly what the Trump administration’s policies are accomplishing. Since January, thanks to Trump’s tariffs, short-term battery storage costs have risen 56 percent to 69 percent. Unsurprisingly, deployment of battery storage on the grid is expected to fall 30 percent over the next decade. The Trump administration likes to harp constantly about supporting “affordable, reliable, and secure energy”—they forget to add “as long as it suits my party’s ideological priors.”

This comes as Trump and the GOP rail against U.S. dependence on Chinese batteries and the need to reshore American manufacturing, after passing a bill that decimates the domestic battery industry.

While the final version of the GOP mega bill technically retains the advanced manufacturing tax credit for battery producers, new FEOC rules (read: China) impose unworkable domestic content requirements that make the credits inaccessible. Both complex and overly restrictive, the FEOC provisions will require regulatory guidance from the Treasury Department—a process that took two years under Biden. Until then, it’s unlikely that companies will invest without knowing whether they’ll qualify for the credits.

Meanwhile, the GOP is aggressively deregulating extractive industries. While boosting critical mineral production can support the buildout of a domestic supply chain, it makes little sense to simultaneously undercut the high-value-add industries like battery manufacturing that create the very demand for those minerals.

Yet Trump is doing just that. He has leaned on the Cold War–era Defense Production Act to boost investment in critical mineral production. The Department of the Interior is streamlining permitting processes for lithium mines. Trump strong-armed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky into granting the U.S. sweeping economic privileges over Ukraine’s mineral resources. However, these resources are critical because they serve the transition to clean energy. Why produce more lithium if not to make more batteries?

Trump announced a 50 percent tariff in July on copper imports, citing the critical need for the conductive metal in everything from semiconductors to ships to batteries. But the U.S. imports 40 percent of its copper, and there’s no alternative path to achieve copper self-sufficiency in the near or long term. Whereas a new battery plant can come online within two years, a new mine can take over 20 years to open up production. In the U.S., the average development time to open a new copper mine takes up to 32 years. Investors can hardly expect American trade policy to remain stable for 30 days, let alone during the remaining three-plus years of Trump’s term in office. Ultimately, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have been pursuing policies to expand domestic mining, refining, and processing of critical minerals—arguably worthy goals, but not if you’re simultaneously destroying the manufacturing of products derived from such resources. They are ceding the lead in clean tech to China so the U.S. can become a raw materials exporter like so many Third World nations trapped in the cycle of extraction without development.

Justin Wolfers, the University of Michigan economist, accurately sums up Trump’s “plan” to restore U.S. manufacturing: “Raise the price of inputs like steel, aluminum & copper; create shortages of rare earths; invite retaliatory tariffs; cut R&D; raise borrowing costs by blowing out the budget; and … cover it all in a thick cloud of uncertainty.”

The 50 percent tariff on imported steel has doubled the price of domestic steel, yet many companies still import because even inflated foreign steel is cheaper. The nascent American battery industry hasn’t had enough time to relocate its supply chain. China still dominates the global market for key battery components, which U.S. companies must depend on until suitable (and competitive) domestic alternatives emerge. Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff wars don’t guide investment—they paralyze it.

Trump returned to office partly under the dubious promise to “Make America Great Again” by reviving domestic manufacturing and restoring high-wage blue-collar jobs. Now he and the GOP aren’t just breaking that promise, they’re spitting in the face of the Americans who believed them.",https://washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Nov-25-Battery-Hassett.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 19:18:18.284647

Liberty Energy Investment Narrative Recap

For Liberty Energy, the core investment thesis rests on the company's ability to deliver innovative oilfield services and power solutions amid shifting demand for onshore oil and natural gas. The recent dual listing on NYSE Texas could elevate Liberty's profile and improve share liquidity, but it does not materially alter the most pressing short-term catalyst, customer completions activity, or mitigate the risk of margin pressure from declining rig counts and lower service pricing into late 2025.

One of the most relevant recent announcements is Liberty's modest dividend increase to US$0.09 per share, declared alongside softer third-quarter earnings. This comes as the company braces for challenging market conditions, underlining its intent to reward shareholders even as visibility into near-term profit growth remains limited.

However, despite higher trading access, investors should be aware that increased exposure to market fluctuations could amplify the impact of ongoing pricing headwinds and...

Liberty Energy's outlook projects $4.3 billion in revenue and $41.3 million in earnings by 2028. This assumes a 1.8% annual revenue growth rate and a decrease in earnings of $175.5 million from the current $216.8 million.

The installation of solar panels at the fire station will reduce electricity costs and make the building more energy-efficient, said Smith and David Glasson, the city’s administrator.
In all, Glasson estimates that the city has paid about $9,000 annually for power at the fire station over the past three years.","LONG BEACH — Thousands of dollars in potential annual savings are on the table for the City of Long Beach after it was recently awarded a state grant to install solar panels at a city facility.

Long Beach received notice from the Washington State Department of Commerce on Oct. 8 that its application to install solar panels at the city’s fire station at 701 Washington Ave. N, was selected to receive $316,185 in grant funding. The city is required to cover 5% in matching funds for the project; around $16,000.

The funding comes through the department’s Clean Energy Grants program, which prioritizes construction-ready projects aimed at increasing access to reliable and affordable energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and aligning with state energy strategies. More than $41 million was initially awarded to 49 projects across the state, the majority of which were solar-related.

The city’s application was not originally selected to receive funding, according to Long Beach Deputy City Administrator Ariel Smith, but was ultimately awarded after further funding became available through the grant program. The contract was formally signed in late October, allowing the city to start incurring costs.

The installation of solar panels at the fire station will reduce electricity costs and make the building more energy-efficient, said Smith and David Glasson, the city’s administrator. While noting that he’s still reading up on the final agreement with the PUD, Glasson said the intention is for the fire station to be “net metered” — meaning the city will receive billing credit for the power the solar panels generate, with any usage that the exceeds what the solar panels generate being billed on the “net.”

“We will generate a surplus during most days and have to use power at night or during inclement weather,” said Glasson, adding that the fire station’s electricity bill ranges from a low of about $250 during the summer months to a high of more than $1,000 in the colder months.

In all, Glasson estimates that the city has paid about $9,000 annually for power at the fire station over the past three years.

Long Beach was also looking at installing solar panels at its wastewater plant during the same funding cycle for Commerce’s clean energy grant program, Glasson said, “but the application wasn’t going to score well, so we decided the fire station was the better option.” With the grant program only requiring a local match of 5%, he added that the city would like to add solar panels at both the water and wastewater plants because of how much power they require to operate.",https://chinookobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/Chinook-Observer.png,N,,2025-11-02 19:18:22.017803

The company is also expanding its renewable energy portfolio by investing in solar and wind power businesses to benefit from decreasing renewable energy costs.","This year marks the first for energy conglomerate Banpu Plc's ""symphony"" of businesses seeking to accelerate the company's transition to clean energy.

Under its six-year ""Energy Symphonics"" strategy from 2025 to 2030 the company intends to deal with key energy challenges to achieve business sustainability.

Energy Symphonics refers to a synchronised approach to creating new and sustainable energy solutions to address the world's surging energy demand, while also looking after the planet, according to chief executive Sinon Vongkusolkit, who unveiled this strategy late last year.

""We are passionate about tackling the energy trilemma head-on,"" he said, referring to Banpu's ongoing efforts to balance energy security, equity and sustainability.

This strategy replaced the ""Greener and Smarter"" strategy implemented during the previous five years, paving the way for more serious efforts to combat climate change.

Banpu has pledged to achieve a net-zero target, meaning a balance between greenhouse gas emissions and absorption, by 2050, 15 years ahead of the government's goal of 2065.

PURSUING SUSTAINABILITY

The company continues to adjust its businesses to be less dependent on fossil fuels and focus more on new sources of energy.

Banpu wants to be part of global efforts to ensure energy needs are met and, through improved environmental protection, maintain the ability of future generations to meet theirs, said Mr Sinon.

Over the next two years, the company plans to seriously reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions from its businesses, said Jirameth Achcha, head of Banpu's corporate services and activities.

The company mines coal and produces natural gas, as well as operates power generation facilities using fossil fuels and renewable energy. Banpu also offers smart energy solutions, focusing on new energy technologies that support the transition towards clean energy.

""The company is trying to avoid injecting a large portion of money into businesses that emit a high level of greenhouse gases,"" said Mr Jirameth.

Banpu plans to reduce investments in coal businesses, with the aim of cutting the share of coal earnings to less than half of total revenue in a shift towards sustainable energy development, he said.

Revenue from the coal trade, which comprised 65% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation last year, should be reduced to less than 50% by 2030, according to Mr Sinon.

The company operates coal businesses in Australia, China and Indonesia.

Banpu is making its coal mines more environmentally friendly by replacing oil-powered vehicles used at its mines with electric vehicles (EVs), said Mr Jirameth. The company is also less reliant on coal by using more biomass fuel at its power plants, he said.

A shift towards other natural resources supports Banpu's campaign to promote clean energy. For example, the company is pursuing a new opportunity related to nickel mining in Indonesia.

Nickel is a key component in batteries used to power EVs, helping to reduce tailpipe emissions from oil powered-vehicles. The element can also be recovered from old batteries for reuse.

PT Indo Tambangraya Megah Tbk, a subsidiary of Banpu, invested in the nickel mining business by acquiring in July this year a 9.62% stake in PT Adhi Kartiko Pratama Tbk (AKP), which is listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

AKP operates a nickel mine in North Konawe in Southeast Sulawesi province.

This investment in nickel mining accounts for 20% of the company's five-year investment budget of US$3 billion, said Mr Sinon.

The spending plan is scheduled to be implemented from 2025 to 2030 under the Energy Symphonics strategy.

Some 60% of the budget is to support natural gas and power businesses, while the remaining 20% funds the company's renewable energy business.

ENERGY RELIABILITY

Banpu is addressing concerns over unsteady electricity supply from renewable energy sources by adopting battery energy storage systems (BESS).

This stationary form of battery serves as back-up power for users to ensure electricity from renewable power generation facilities is always available for use.

The sun and wind are intermittent sources of energy generation making them dependent on weather conditions and seasons. These renewable energies cannot produce electricity all the time, so a BESS can ensure a more reliable supply.

A BESS can be developed by using a battery farm, ensuring a stable supply of clean energy.

Banpu Power Plc, the power generation arm of Banpu, announced earlier it is preparing to venture into the BESS business in the US.

The company already pursued a similar opportunity in Japan, where it developed a battery farm.

Banpu Power proposed the second BESS project to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees and manages the electrical grid in most of the southern US state, said Issara Niropas, chief executive of Banpu Power.

He stressed the need to catch the growing trend in utilising BESS as demand for renewable power is rapidly growing.

Electricity demand in the US is rising, driven by the development of data centres and greater use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, according to the company.

In Japan, Banpu Next, Banpu's energy technology arm, operates a 58-megawatt-hour BESS farm in the city of Tono. The facility is designed to supply electricity to 5,800 houses.

The company plans to expand its BESS business to other Asia-Pacific nations, said Mr Issara.

GREATER AFFORDABILITY

To make energy prices more affordable, Banpu devised various approaches to control its expenses, diversify energy sources and adopt technologies to enhance productivity.

Despite the challenges of a volatile energy market, Banpu is confident its Energy Symphonics strategy will drive growth and create long-term value for shareholders, said Mr Sinon.

Regarding mining, the company plans to adopt AI and smart mining technology to reduce operating costs and enhance productivity, he said.

According to Banpu, the company does not depend on a single energy source to avoid price volatility.

The company's businesses use both traditional and cleaner forms of energy.

In the US, Banpu is focusing on gas production as an alternative to coal and because it allows the company to better manage costs from the source, said Mr Sinon.

The company is also expanding its renewable energy portfolio by investing in solar and wind power businesses to benefit from decreasing renewable energy costs.

The investments should help the company reduce the total cost of energy generation in the long term, he said.

Banpu also utilises high efficiency, low emissions (HELE) technology to reduce power generation costs.

The technology is applied to its Temple I combined-cycle power plant with electricity generation capacity of 768 megawatts.

HELE increases the facility's thermal efficiency through the use of both a gas turbine and steam turbine, allowing the plant to produce more electricity from the same fuel input, thus reducing fuel costs per megawatt-hour.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/11/03/5835318_700.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 18:18:18.333466

The lobby group said the change could add as much as £300 to the annual charging bill for some people if the cost is passed on to the customer.
Business rates are taxes paid on most commercial properties in the UK to fund local services, but charging bays have not yet been added to lists of rateable properties.
That might mean that the first bill for the current financial year could be more than double the £100m.
The Conservative government in 2022 exempted charging equipment from business rates, but the parking bays themselves were not included.","The UK charging industry has said it could face a £100m bill as the government considers making public charger operators pay business rates for the first time, at a time when slower-than-expected electric car sales have put pressure on the sector.

ChargeUK, an industry body, said that its estimates suggest that operators will have to pay business rates on as many as 64,000 parking bays beside chargers which have not, up to now, been liable for the taxes. The lobby group said the change could add as much as £300 to the annual charging bill for some people if the cost is passed on to the customer.

The number of public chargers has soared during recent years to cater for more than 1m battery electric cars on British roads. There were 86,000 public chargers at the end of September, an 18% increase on the 73,000 at the end of 2024, according to data company Zap Map.

Business rates are taxes paid on most commercial properties in the UK to fund local services, but charging bays have not yet been added to lists of rateable properties. The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) has told the charging industry this will change next April – meaning charging companies will have to pay the taxes for the first time.

Ian Johnston, the chief executive of Osprey Charging, said that his business would consider closing some sites and slowing down investment because of the extra costs – particularly away from London, which has the highest number of electric cars.

“Large, high-power hubs in certain regions of the Midlands and north [of England] are more likely to be loss-making because we have built ahead of EV uptake,” he added.

ChargeUK said it believed that the VOA’s own assumptions of a £25m cost for the sector were too small, because it had underestimated how many bays would be rateable, and the average rents paid.

To make matters worse for the charger companies, the bill may be backdated as far as 1 April 2023 as the VOA works out the final details of its review. That might mean that the first bill for the current financial year could be more than double the £100m.

The Conservative government in 2022 exempted charging equipment from business rates, but the parking bays themselves were not included. The VOA said that individual bays in larger charging sites and standalone EV charging sites would probably be added to ratings lists, because the operator tends to have exclusive occupation of the spaces.

ChargeUK argued that the bays should also be exempted, given the government’s desire to promote the uptake of electric vehicles to meet its legal obligations to cut polluting carbon emissions. The Treasury would have to exempt the sector in the budget on 26 November.

Vicky Read, the ChargeUK chief executive, said: “The cost pressures the sector is bearing are tough, with business rates threatening to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. We need government intervention to remove this unexpected burden, alongside action to address sky high standing charges [on electricity] and inequitable VAT.”

A VOA spokesperson said it would engage with the charging companies, and added: “We have a statutory duty to maintain non-domestic rating lists. If any property meets criteria in line with legislation and rating law, we must assess it and assign it a rateable value.”

The Treasury was approached for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5fb3040d17a8fb58e70942562025b76af0fb878/833_0_4167_3335/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0aad082998a2a8d81759a18967c65998",N,,2025-11-02 18:18:36.706668

Greenwashing can occur (or be alleged) at various points along the supply chain—from claims about sourcing practices, to emissions impacts from product transportation, and to the composition of a final product. Some forms of greenwashing allegations, such as those from plaintiff classes and environmental groups, have become commonplace. Two recent sets of allegations are, well, green: utilizing greenwashing claims to obtain competitive and political benefits. Companies should stay aware of old and new greenwashing trends and take practical actions to guard against such claims.

Green Guides

The “Green Guides,” found at 16 C.F.R. § 260, serve as the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) “current views about environmental claims.” Included in the Green Guides are several examples of what the FTC deems impermissible greenwashing related to general environmental claims, as well as specific claims such as carbon offsets, certifications, “free-of” claims, non-toxic claims, recyclability, and claims related to renewable energy and materials. Notwithstanding these examples, to date the FTC has avoided specifically opining on claims related to the life cycle of a product—the product’s “environmental impact through all the stages of its life.” The FTC only suggests marketers “may need to consider the significant environmental impacts of a product or service through its lifetime.” While the Green Guides themselves are mere “administrative interpretations of law,” many states have referenced or incorporated at least portions of the Green Guides into their respective consumer protection and advertising statutes.

Greenwashing claims as a business and political tool

Take a manufacturer of cleaning products for example, who reached a settlement with a plaintiff class alleging their products were “falsely and misleadingly” labeled as “Non-Toxic” and “Earth Friendly.” As part of the settlement, the defendant agreed to remove the “Non-Toxic” labels and add an asterisk to the “Earth Friendly” label to further qualify the claims.

These greenwashing claims follow common molds: a plaintiff class alleging deceptive environmental marketing led them to purchase a product they otherwise would not have, and an environmental group alleging a company is failing to live up to its products’ environmental claims.

But the universe of greenwashing claims may be expanding.

For starters, a manufacturer of hearing protection products filed a greenwashing suit against a competitor claiming it “intentionally misled and deceived distributors, downstream purchasing companies and end users” through “unqualified” claims about their earplugs such as that they are “eco-friendly,” “sustainable,” “bio-based,” and part of an “eco-series.” As part of its complaint, the plaintiff claims it independently tested the earplugs for “bio-based content” and found that at most, the earplugs were 40% bio-based, significantly less than the claimed 82% bio-based content. The plaintiff is seeking an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct, as well as an order directing the defendant to issue “corrective advertising” to address “consumer deception.”

Second, the attorney general of Montana and 15 other Republican attorneys general delivered a letter to several technology companies seeking information related to the companies’ “claim[s] they are 100% powered by renewable energy” based upon the use of renewable energy certificates. According to the letter, the companies claiming to commit to 100% renewable power places pressure on utilities “to move away from fossil-fuel-generated baseload power” to attract those companies as customers. This pressure has allegedly led to early retirements of coal and natural gas power plants, which in turn, threatens grid reliability. (While unstated, these retirements may also reduce demand for coal from Montana’s Powder River Basin.)

Rather than seeking to recover damages for purchases of a greenwashed product, or align a defendant’s environmental practices with its claims as is typical with greenwashing suits, the plaintiff is instead alleging the defendant is using “a calculated ‘greenwashing’ scheme to capture market share from competitors,” and the attorney generals’ greenwashing claims appear designed to serve as leverage to incentivize large technology companies to back away from all-renewable targets and to maintain demand for fossil fuels to support regional energy industries. Together they represent a new front in the use of greenwashing for business and political objectives.

Protecting against greenwashing claims

With these new developments in the greenwashing arena, it may seem as though greenwashing claims can come from many angles. While it is not possible to guarantee that one’s company will never find itself facing greenwashing claims, there are practical steps that can be taken to minimize the risk of liability.

· Familiarize yourself with the Green Guides. While the FTC’s materials are not binding and would not serve as the basis for a cause of action in and of itself, many states expressly or implicitly follow the Green Guides as part of their consumer protection schemes. Moreover, courts will give varying degrees of persuasive weight to the Green Guides.

· Familiarize yourself with the state laws and common laws in areas where your products are sold. From coast-to-coast and internationally, each jurisdiction will have different variations of consumer protection and false advertising laws. Companies should be aware of these differences and consider whether it makes strategic sense to ensure compliance with the most stringent applicable laws, regardless of jurisdiction.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/francesco-scatena-adobestock-781192496.LIjzXwzoyo.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-02 17:18:16.424481

“It’s deeply unsettling to have a neighbor that’s disrespectful and intimidating,” said Williams, Michigan City resident and executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana.
Chris Johnson, Michigan City Water Works Director, previously said the city has “more than enough” capacity left to supply water for a data center.
Mark owns an Airbnb in Michigan City, and she’s worried that the data center might impact her business, she said.
As the data center construction continues, Williams said it’s important for JTNWI members and Michigan City residents to stay vigilant and hold developers accountable.","As the construction of a data center looms in Michigan City, one resident and local activist said the land’s owners are not good neighbors for the community.

“It’s deeply unsettling to have a neighbor that’s disrespectful and intimidating,” said Williams, Michigan City resident and executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana. “It’s not at all right. We already have a history of dealing with environmental issues across the city and a legacy of injustice, and this just exacerbates it.”

Just Transition Northwest Indiana has launched its “30 Days of Accountability” campaign, which encourages Michigan City residents to come together and express concerns about the data center.

According to JTNWI’s website, residents interested in assisting the campaign can be a community observer and document what they see at the site, volunteer with the organization and support efforts through outreach, research or public speaking.

“We deserve better, and we know we deserve better,” Williams said. “We’re calling for them to do this. We’re asking for folks to join us, from academics, business owners, anyone and everyone to join us.”

In September, the Michigan City Council passed four resolutions that would allow the construction of a data center at 402 Royal Road, which is currently owned by Phoenix Investors, according to Post-Tribune archives. A representative for Phoenix Investors was unable to immediately respond to a request for comment.

Resolutions provided multiple tax abatements, designated the area as an economic revitalization area and approved a taxpayer agreement for “Project Maize,” also known as the data center location. The data center operator has yet to be announced, but Williams and other JTNWI members believe the end user will be Google.

“We call on the Michigan City Common Council to demand an immediate halt to construction, full site remediation, and a comprehensive impact assessment at 402 Royal Road, and to revoke the tax abatements and hold Phoenix Investors accountable for exposing residents and our youngest generations to these hazards, so we can start to make things right,” Williams said.

Residents, including Williams, spoke during public comment at multiple council meetings regarding the data center, voicing environmental, public health and financial concerns.

A previous Phoenix Investors presentation said Michigan City is an ideal location for a data center because reusing an empty facility allows for a sustainable approach, its proximity to a NIPSCO substation, the available capacity for water supply and sanitary discharge, a low latency for users, it’s disaster-safe, and it has site-specific designs and a skilled workforce.

The presentation also said the final economic impact for the city would be $26.1 million, and the city would feel about $6.6 million in the first 90 days. Chris Johnson, Michigan City Water Works Director, previously said the city has “more than enough” capacity left to supply water for a data center. Rick Calinski, director of economic development and public affairs for NIPSCO, said the utility will not raise customers’ electric rates to power the data center.

Councilwoman Nancy Moldenhauer, D-6th, consistently voted against the resolutions out of concern for residents in the sixth ward, which is where the data center will be located.

“I am concerned about pollution at brownfield sites like the Royal Road property and how it is handled, yet Michigan City is coordinating with (the Indiana Department of Environmental Management) and the develop to (ensure) Phoenix sets up a full information website of all permits, citations and responses for everyone to examine ongoingly,” Moldenauer said in an email to the Post-Tribune.

Moldenhauer told the Post-Tribune that she doesn’t believe data centers belong in urban areas, but because the area is zoned as light industry, there wasn’t much the city could do to prevent a data center.

In her email, Moldenhauer said the city has made several accomplishments to address data center concerns, such as an ordinance that sets the maximum sound level at 60 decibels instead of 65, which was originally proposed by the developer. The Michigan City Sustainability Commission also passed a resolution that requires “all Michigan City outdoor light fixtures be fully shielded with no light escaping above the horizon and that they be 3,000K or lower,” Moldenhauer said, adding that the developer also agreed to install sound level monitors by the roadside.

Williams said JTNWI’s campaign launched after IDEM, on Oct. 9, cited Phoenix Investors with a violation letter at the data center site. The violation letter followed a Sept. 24 inspection that found violations in the uncontaminated soil policy, Williams said.

According to the violation, IDEM found trichloroethylene, or TCE, which the National Cancer Institute defines as a “volatile, colorless liquid organic chemical” that can be found in air, water and soil. Williams said TCE has been linked to cancer, kidney disease, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cardiac defects.

“They were transporting contaminated dirt and soil through our communities and past schools, where children, businesses and families all have potentially been exposed,” Williams said. “We felt very validated to see those violations handed down because it validates what our community has been saying all along.”

Eileen Mark, another Michigan City resident, is involved with JTNWI’s accountability campaign. Mark’s concerns not only lie with the environmental and public health effects, but also with workers’ safety. According to a police report, a worker at the facility fell through the roof on Oct. 9.

Mark owns an Airbnb in Michigan City, and she’s worried that the data center might impact her business, she said.

“It could deter people from coming if the air smells like gas, or if there’s other issues,” Mark said. “Fortunately, I’m not very close to (the data center site), but I care about my neighbors and the ones who are close. It’s terrible that they’re going to have to live with this.”

Dominic Yanke, a Michigan City resident and member of JTNWI, lives about three-quarters of a mile away from the proposed data center site, he said.

Yanke has spoken about his concerns with the data center at Michigan City council meetings, detailing issues with dust that makes it difficult to drive down Royal Road and communicating with workers at the site about residents’ worries.

“I’m concerned about the air quality for the most part,” Yanke said. “I have asthma, and there’s already days where the ozone’s too bad or other pollutants in the air are so high that I can’t even go outside. Or if I am outside, I start having trouble breathing.”

Residents have been told that the data center will run backup generators once a month, Yanke said, which he said is “too much to have diesel fumes everywhere.” Although the noise at the data center will be lower than first expected, Yanke said it will “still be annoying” for those who live nearby.

Yanke’s role in the accountability campaign includes taking photos of violations and environmental and public health concerns. He believes documenting issues will help residents build a better case against the data center.

Through the accountability campaign, Mark said she plans to help with canvassing and encouraging people to watch More Perfect Union’s videos that show the negative effects of data centers.

“It talks about Indiana being a target state for these data centers,” Mark said. “Since then, we’re seeing a lot of positive things happening in the way of shutting these down and sending them away. Where they’re going to go, we don’t know, but we have to fight for our own communities.”

Mark would like to see more of a response from elected officials, including those in Michigan City and throughout the state of Indiana.

“The opposition is going to continue growing,” Mark said. “When this thing’s up and running, and people can’t sleep because of the noise and light pollution, and the kids are on the playground breathing in diesel particles, and people start to get sick, people are really going to have opposition.”

In a July 14 statement, Michigan City Mayor Angie Nelson Deuitch said city government officials were made aware of a potential data center development. Nelson Deuitch’s administration and council members entered into non-disclosure agreements to review the concept in a confidential executive session.

The $800 million capital investment would come with “limited job creation and no assurances of community reinvestment or substantial tax impact,” Nelson Deuitch’s statement said.

No formal agreement was reached at the time, the statement said, and it did not present binding commitments to ensure lasting benefits to Michigan City residents.

“Michigan City welcomes innovation and responsible investment, but our administration will always advocate for economic growth that is equitable, transparent and in the public interest,” Nelson Deuitch said in her statement.

As the data center construction continues, Williams said it’s important for JTNWI members and Michigan City residents to stay vigilant and hold developers accountable. She wants more community members to see how big technology affects their lives.

Williams would also like for JTNWI to be a resource for other communities that later have a data center.

“A community doesn’t have to accept a data center, and they don’t have to be taken advantage of,” Williams said. “There’s other opportunities for the future of municipalities, so it’s important to stay vigilant and continue to provide all these platforms for people to take action.”

That's according to Politico's E&E News, which reported that growing data center power demand caused ratepayer utility bills to jump $4.3 billion last year.

It's a scenario that showcases the importance of cleaner solar energy, noted by Reuters to be one of the cheapest and fastest power sources to develop. When deployed on rooftops, it gives homeowners control over their electricity supply.

What is driving the electricity demand?

E&E's story spotlighted PJM Interconnection, the outfit that coordinates electricity movement in a roughly square-shaped territory from western-most Ohio to the East Coast, and from the Pennsylvania/New York border to southern Virginia. Washington, DC, and Northern Virginia's ""Data Center Alley"" are included, according to PJM.

The story said that massive energy needs are mostly attributed to data centers, where powerful computers are fulfilling our search inquiries and artificial intelligence work orders, per the report.

""By 2028, an average family in the region will be paying around $70 a month extra on their electricity bills because of forecasted data center growth,"" the Natural Resources Defense Council estimated.

Leasing solar panels through Palmetto's LightReach can protect homeowners from spiking monthly power bills. The program bypasses upfront costs associated with buying an array. Homeowners pay a set monthly fee and use all of the electricity generated, helping to offset price hikes. Palmetto is responsible for setup, installation, and eventual panel removal.

Why is the demand important?

Runaway computer power use is well-documented. Goldman Sachs said that data center-related energy requirements are forecast to rise 165% by 2030. As a result, NPR reported that electricity rate spikes are outpacing inflation.

E&E's story noted that leaders consider AI development an international race that the United States needs to win, incentivizing even more computing. In response, tech giants are in some cases building their own power plants using dirty fuels to power the operations, according to the Texas Tribune.

Microsoft is reopening a portion of Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear site in one of the more unusual scenarios. And Meta has invested in cleaner solar to help offset its electricity use. It's an energy source free of heat-trapping air pollution. That's important because NASA linked our planet's warming to increased risks for severe storms that further complicate the power supply with line-downing weather events.

E&E cited forecasts that have projected rate increases in PJM's territory to hit $163 billion through 2033. Price caps, such as one negotiated in Pennsylvania, limit some immediate impact. But once the cap is lifted, the rates soar, per the story.

NRDC said the process is based too greatly on speculation, and there is some fear that demand estimates could be too high. Regardless, ratepayers will suffer unless the system is refined.

""As a final twist of the knife, PJM residents will be on the hook for skyrocketing prices, even if these data centers don't get built,"" NRDC reported.

How can solar help?

Home solar removes some of the variables associated with the grid supply since the electricity is generated and used onsite. Battery backups, such as a Tesla Powerwall, save the electricity for later use.

Buying a rooftop array can reduce or eliminate household utility bills if leasing isn't right for you. EnergySage can help overcome upfront costs with quote comparisons, finding the right installer, and securing tax rebates before they expire on Dec. 31.

""We'd be jumping the gun if we answer your question,"" about the new vehicles, he told an analyst.

Shares of Tesla fell nearly 6% in after-hours trading during the presentation that ended just after 8 p.m. Eastern time.

Musk announced that Tesla plans to build a new factory in Mexico near Monterrey. Company executives said it will not take production from any other factories, where Tesla expects to expand production. They said the Mexican plant would build the next generation of vehicles, which also will be built at other factories.

It's likely that the next generation vehicles will be smaller than the current ones to bring the prices down, but that wasn't clear from the presentation. Many automakers build smaller vehicles in Mexico to save on labor costs and preserve profit margins.

CFRA Analyst Garrett Nelson attributed the drop in Tesla's stock to the lack of details on the new vehicles as well as the company's history of seeing its share price rise ahead of big events, only to fall when the actual news is made.

He said the company's long-term focus may have disappointed some investors, but he sees Tesla's vision as justifying its high stock valuation versus other automakers.

What they outlined really made the case that it deserves to trade at a big premium to the rest of the industry,"" he said.

Franz Von Holzhausen, Tesla's design chief, said the company must make another sharp reduction in costs in order to reach its ambitious electric-vehicle production target of 20 million vehicles per year by 2030. Tesla expects to manufacture 1.8 million this year.

The company, he said, will build the cars in smaller modular units, then bring those units together. The system uses less space. Executives said as a result, its next electric powertrain factory will be half the size of the one Tesla just built in Austin, costing 65% less.

That also means we can build more factories at the same time,"" said Tom Zhu, who leads Tesla manufacturing.

Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said the company cut costs in half between the early Models S and X and the second generation, Models 3 and Y. It's planning to do that again for the next generation, but also will improve the cars at the same time, he said.

The company also said it would design vehicles so they have fewer wires and transistors, and use fewer expensive rare-Earth metals in the batteries.

As we improve affordability, the number of customers who have access to our products increases,"" Kirkhorn said.

Musk said demand for Tesla vehicles is large, but many who want one now can't afford them.

Executives said Tesla is unique from other automakers because all the people involved in vehicle design and manufacturing are in the same room. The company also designs and makes many of its parts and software while others rely on tiers of parts supply companies.

The company also said it has opened 10 of its supercharger stations to owners of other electric vehicles as of Wednesday. And it plans to offer a package of unlimited home charging for $30 per month in Texas using wind as the power source.

Kirkhorn said the new master plan includes product advances, rapid volume growth and technology advancement.

Musk began the session saying there is a clear path to sustainable energy on Earth, but it will take changing just about everything from fossil fuel power to electricity generated by renewable sources. The Earth can support more people than it does now without destroying natural habitats or huge austerity, he said.",https://mynews4.com/resources/media/e8327a67-f735-4ea4-b079-2c69284adb83-AP23055699592659.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 18:18:43.549590

ExxonMobil Is Thriving in the Current Environment.,"Matt DiLallo, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/02/lower-oil-prices-no-problem-exxonmobil-is-thriving/,"While lower oil prices tend to negatively impact oil company earnings, ExxonMobil (XOM 0.29%) isn't your average oil producer.
Here's why Exxon is thriving amid lower oil prices.
This cost-saving strategy enables Exxon to make more money at lower oil prices.
It boasts a sector-leading 9.5% net-debt-to-capital ratio, backed by a substantial $13.9 billion cash balance.
The company is earning more money at lower oil prices.","Crude prices have slumped this year. Brent oil, the global benchmark price, is currently in the mid-$60s, down about $10 a barrel from this time last year. While lower oil prices tend to negatively impact oil company earnings, ExxonMobil (XOM 0.29%) isn't your average oil producer.

That was abundantly clear in the oil giant's third-quarter financial results. ExxonMobil generated $7.5 billion, or $1.76 per share, of earnings during the period and $14.8 billion in cash flow from operations. That was the highest earnings per share the company has produced compared to similar oil price environments. Here's why Exxon is thriving amid lower oil prices.

Drilling down into Exxon's third-quarter financial results

Exxon delivered record-setting production in Guyana and the Permian Basin. The oil giant started its fourth development in Guyana (Yellowtail), which came online four months early and under budget, boosting its average crude oil output to 700,000 barrels per day. Meanwhile, the company grew its production in the Permian Basin to 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day, fueled in part by the expanded use of proprietary technologies that are boosting well recoveries by up to 20%.

Yellowtail was one of eight major capital projects Exxon has started up this year. It has two more on track to come online by the end of 2025. ""No one else in our industry is executing at this scale, with this level of innovation, or delivering this kind of value,"" stated CEO Darren Woods in the third-quarter earnings press release.

Exxon also continues to execute its structural cost savings program. It has achieved an additional $2.2 billion of savings this year, pushing its cumulative total to $14 billion since launching this initiative in 2019. Exxon aims to increase the total to $18 billion by 2030. This cost-saving strategy enables Exxon to make more money at lower oil prices.

Exxon's strong financial results are allowing it to continue returning significant cash to shareholders. The oil giant returned $9.4 billion to investors via share repurchases and dividends. That brought its year-to-date total to $27.8 billion, comprising $12.9 billion in dividend payments and $14.9 billion in share repurchases. Even with those cash returns, Exxon maintained a fortress-like balance sheet. It boasts a sector-leading 9.5% net-debt-to-capital ratio, backed by a substantial $13.9 billion cash balance.

""ExxonMobil had a strong third quarter,"" stated CEO Darren Woods in the earnings press release, ""continuing to demonstrate that we are truly in a league of our own.""

Building toward an even better future

The energy giant continues to invest heavily to build an even better company. Capital spending totaled $8.6 billion in the quarter, including $2.4 billion in growth acquisitions. Exxon acquired an additional 80,000 net acres in the Permian Basin to expand its presence in this core area. Additionally, the company bought key assets from Superior Graphite, advancing its entry into the battery anode materials market.

The company is investing heavily to expand its upstream and downstream businesses. Exxon plans to increase its upstream oil and gas production to an average of 5.4 million BOE per day by 2030 (up from its current level of 4.7 million BOE per day). It aims to derive more than 60% of its future production from advantaged assets (its lowest-cost, highest-margin areas, such as the Permian and Guyana), up from the current level of 50%. Exxon is also investing significantly to expand its downstream product solutions businesses, which include refining, chemicals, and advanced materials. By 2030, Exxon aims to deliver $4.5 billion of annual earnings from this segment, up from $1.6 billion year-to-date.

Add the incremental earnings from these investments to the company's cost-savings initiatives, and Exxon expects to produce significantly higher earnings by 2030. That positions the company to continue returning more cash to investors. Exxon is on track to repurchase $20 billion of its shares this year and intends to buy back a similar amount next year. It also increased its dividend by another 4%, extending its growth streak to an industry-leading 43 consecutive years.

The best just keeps getting better

Exxon's strategy of investing heavily to grow its best assets while simultaneously stripping out structural costs is paying big dividends. The company is earning more money at lower oil prices. The oil giant plans to continue leaning into this strategy over the next five years, positioning it to produce even higher earnings in the future. Exxon's ability to thrive in any market environment makes it one of the best oil stocks to buy and hold for the long term.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/840603/xom.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 17:02:44.705169

The History and Future of Solar Grazing Solar grazing started with sheep, with some of the earliest U.S. examples coming online in the early 2010s.
The solar project, Turkey Creek Solar Ranch, went online in 2022 on a 750-acre property.","LANCASTER, Ky.—It is unusual to have a utility-scale solar array in Kentucky, and even more unusual that the grounds crew here is a live-in flock of more than a thousand sheep.

On a recent afternoon, the sheep lounged beneath the shade created by solar panels, supervised by three dogs: Honey, Junior and Roxy.

The property is a farm and a power plant, and the developer, Silicon Ranch, is using this site to test how to maximize the income from both businesses. The work is part of an effort by solar companies and farmers searching for ways to efficiently utilize the hundreds of millions of acres in the United States used for livestock grazing.

Nick de Vries, Silicon Ranch’s chief technology officer, walked along a row of panels, explaining that his company and others have largely figured out how to integrate sheep farming and solar. The next step is to replicate the process with cattle, he said.

Silicon Ranch developed a system to work with cattle. The company provided details on the system, called CattleTracker, ahead of a public announcement coming at a later date.

The combination of solar and cattle could transform the renewable energy landscape, opening up vast stretches of land for solar development, contributing to a transition away from climate-warming fossil fuels.

It also would address concerns about solar encroaching on food production and agribusiness, de Vries said. That’s an important factor in Kentucky, which ranks in the bottom 10 in the country in utility-scale solar installed capacity.

Silicon Ranch’s system shows progress on cattle and solar that would help the industry move from a few small pilot projects to the potential for commercial scale.

Inside Climate News visited this farm to discuss CattleTracker and check on the progress of agrivoltaics—the integration of solar and agriculture—at a time when the Trump administration is eliminating renewable energy subsidies and cutting budgets for research grants.

Developing solar with cattle presents a major opportunity to expand solar energy, given the vast size of the U.S. beef industry, but it also poses some significant challenges.

“They’re very large animals,” de Vries said. “They scrape on things. They like to rub.”

He has become an authority within the industry on mixing livestock and solar, which is often called solar grazing, and its practitioners have a trade group, the American Solar Grazing Association.

He views the challenges with cattle as surmountable. He stepped to a nearby row of panels and pointed out which parts can withstand contact with a cow, and which are vulnerable.

The main idea behind CattleTracker is that panels are vulnerable when turned at close to vertical angles because they are then low enough for cows to bump into them. The solution is to adjust the tracker system—the machines that tilt the panels throughout the day to capture the sun—so that the panels stay at close to a horizontal angle when cows are present.

On a typical ranch, workers move the herd to a different part of a property every few days so the animals can have fresh grass and avoid manure pileup. Solar panels can operate with normal tracking most of the time when cows are away, and with limited tracking when cows are present. The system has controls to set the mode.

Silicon Ranch initially plans to use CattleTracker at some solar projects that it owns and operates, starting this year with a project in Christiana, Tennessee, about 40 miles south of the company’s Nashville headquarters. The privately held company, founded in 2011, has about 150 projects, most of which are spread across the Southeast United States.

An inevitable part of the conversation is that animal agriculture and Americans’ meat-heavy diets are major contributors to climate change. Solar grazing is an attempt to marry a climate solution to a climate problem, with the expectation that the result is a net positive.

People doing the work to expand solar grazing say they are driven by environmental and economic imperatives.

Silicon Ranch’s work on CattleTracker includes determining how to manage biodiversity and increase the land’s capacity to store carbon.

“I don’t think that grass-fed, rotationally grazed livestock [is a] a climate disaster,” de Vries said.

He drew a contrast between concentrated animal feeding operations, which are bad for the environment and bad for animal health, and the kinds of projects his company is pursuing.

Peer-reviewed research has not provided clear answers about the climate ramifications of solar grazing, partly because this kind of development is so new. A paper published in February in the journal Small Ruminant Research found that “knowledge gaps persist” in assessing the benefits and downsides of combining solar and sheep.

The History and Future of Solar Grazing

Solar grazing started with sheep, with some of the earliest U.S. examples coming online in the early 2010s.

It’s a natural fit. Sheep are small enough that they’re unlikely to come into contact with panels. The panels provide shade and the animals eat grass, reducing the need for mowing.

“I just can’t even stress how awesome this opportunity is,” said Daniel Bell, the farmer whose sheep live at the Silicon Ranch solar array in Lancaster.

The solar project, Turkey Creek Solar Ranch, went online in 2022 on a 750-acre property. It has a generating capacity of 70 megawatts.

Bell raises Katahdin sheep, a breed of “hair sheep” that have short hair instead of wool and are raised for their meat.

He has a smaller farm nearby with some sheep but there isn’t enough space for a larger flock. He connected with Silicon Ranch, which allowed him to use the space around the solar panels for grazing and awarded him a contract to maintain the property’s grass. The sheep do most of the work keeping the grass trimmed; Bell and his son mow about once per year.

Of 617 agrivoltaic projects in the United States, more than half focus on growing crops next to solar, according to a database maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Of the 248 projects with livestock, 237 have sheep, eight have cattle and there is one each for horses, goats and a mix of llamas and alpacas.

The American Solar Grazing Association published a census this year that shows Texas has more than half of the country’s acreage for sheep grazing and solar, which isn’t surprising since the state is the leader in sheep farming and is in a virtual tie with California for the lead in utility-scale solar. The census lists 506 solar grazing projects nationwide, more than double the number in the NREL database, which indicates differences in how each report defines a project and how it gathers its data.

Whatever the number of solar grazing sites, it is clear that the sheep industry is small compared to the cattle industry, underscoring the growth potential if solar grazing becomes more popular with cattle farmers. Last year, meat producers slaughtered 138.9 million pounds of sheep, down 9 percent from five years earlier, according to the government’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. The total for beef was 27 billion pounds, which was essentially flat compared to five years ago.

Another reason solar companies are looking to expand into cattle is that the renewable energy industry may already have fulfilled much of its growth potential with sheep farming.

“We’ve hit a bit of a saturation point temporarily with sheep grazing,” said Joe Lawrence, a dairy forage systems specialist at Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, about the projects he’s observed in New York. “I think there are future opportunities, but I feel like the low-hanging fruit, so to speak, was there four or five years ago.”

He works primarily with dairy cows and sees solar grazing with cows as a promising opportunity to expand agrivoltaics. The main challenge is protecting the equipment from the animals.

“Depending on if it’s a dairy or beef cow, it could weigh 1,500 or 2,000 pounds,” he said. “You could certainly see a scenario where they, especially younger animals, would bump into something inadvertently.”

The current examples of solar grazing with cows are all small, designed mostly for research. BlueWave Solar of Massachusetts has three projects in that state, none of which is larger than 20 acres, which is small for utility-scale solar.

One of the three, Grafton Solar, is a partnership with the energy company AES and includes crops, livestock and solar. AES is a large utility and solar developer with projects across the country, so its work with solar and cattle could signal a larger trend among major players in the industry.

Other projects with solar and cows include university-managed test farms near the campuses of the University of Minnesota Morris and Rutgers University in New Jersey.

One common approach is to mount panels high off the ground so there is little chance of contact with cows. But this has downsides in terms of cost, as the developer needs to spend much more on the pylons that support the solar racking.

Silicon Ranch has found that it makes more sense financially to put the panels closer to the ground and use trackers to avoid contact with cows. This is part of a larger company-wide process to examine the totality of a cattle-grazing operation and determine how it can work alongside solar.

In at least one way, the timing of Cattletracker’s rollout is not ideal. It’s the kind of system that may have received substantial interest from federal government agencies in the Biden administration.

But the Trump administration is phasing out and cancelling many of the programs and grants that helped to subsidize renewable energy, including initiatives at the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture.

Silicon Ranch has benefitted from help in the form of government-funded research at universities and national labs to better understand the effects of solar grazing on soil and other environmental and animal health factors.

But de Vries downplayed the harm of having less government support.

“I don’t think that there should be agrivoltaic subsidies,” he said. “You should strive for a good business solution, and then find what’s going to make it replicable, not limited to grants.”

de Vries and his company are confident that the combination of cows and solar will be good for business—and will soon learn if they’re right.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Silicon-Ranch-CattleTracker-Christiana-Solar-TN-1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 15:18:28.026689

Bottom Line 1: The incomplete and biased picture of climate science in the National Academies’ study does a disservice to the public.
Sadly, the Academies’ report isn’t that.","Steven Koonin writes in the WSJ, the The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently issued a report on the effect of GHG emissions. It depicts dire consequences for the nation’s climate, health and welfare.

The study—put together in less than two months—was obviously meant to bolster the scientific basis for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s 2009 finding that GHG emissions threaten the nation’s well-being. It plays down or ignores any evidence undermining that conclusion.

This agenda is evident from the first sentence, which invokes the terrible flood of the Guadalupe River in Texas in July. The report doesn’t mention that similar events have been recorded since the late 19th century and show no detectable trend to the present, even as emissions have soared.

Assessments of climate science often minimize, or even ignore, natural variability to make recent climate trends or weather events seem unusual and hence a consequence of greenhouse-gas emissions.

The Academies’ report is no exception. It describes a recent acceleration of global sea-level rise observed by satellites without mentioning a comparable acceleration during the 1930s.

There are similar failures in the report’s coverage of US heat waves—which aren’t more common in recent decades than they were in the decades around 1900. And North Atlantic hurricanes show no long-term trends in frequency or intensity.

The report deceptively shapes its discussion of models used to project climate changes, gushing about how the models are improving. But it give no quantitative sense of how deficient even the improved models are.

It also omits some important but inconvenient topics. Readers won’t learn of humans’ demonstrated ability to adapt and reduce vulnerability to a changing climate, or of the projected minimal net effect of warming on the US economy.

Bottom Line 1: The incomplete and biased picture of climate science in the National Academies’ study does a disservice to the public. Flawed pronouncements that support advocacy by minimizing or ignoring scientific disagreements feed public distrust.

Botyom Line 2: Complete and transparent analyses of the risks of climate change are overdue. Sadly, the Academies’ report isn’t that. The gov’t would do well to stop funding their climate studies until they get their house in order.

Our Take 1: It’s telling that the Academies’ report cites the Texas floods—arguably the result of poor state governance—even as it fails to mention two North Atlantic hurricane seasons in a row that have produced storm landfalls far below historical averages and inconsistent with increasing chances of Hurricanes smashing into US shores due to climate change.

Our Take 2: We, like Koonin, seriously doubt the Texas floods are as statistically significant climate events as is the mild hurricane activity of the last few years. But the latter are not scary, so they’re ignored.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IgGD!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecea8495-ec05-49a5-9011-3217e9424f25_200x200.jpeg",N,,2025-11-02 13:59:01.986475

""A host of Trump Administration policies — tariff measures and the end of clean vehicle tax credits worth thousands of dollars to car buyers — are causing multinational manufacturing companies to consider pausing hundreds of millions of dollars in future investments, a move that would hit small, majority-Republican towns such as Jeffersonville especially hard,"" Starr reports. ""Moreover, a raid by ICE immigration officers on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Ellabell, a small town in south-east Georgia in September that saw more than 300 South Korean workers detained and sent home, has sent shockwaves through places like Jeffersonville and the C-suites of international companies alike.""

In Fayette County, Ohio, Trump won 77 percent of the vote in 2024. And according to resident Amy Wright, the county is hurting.

Wright told The Guardian, ""The construction process has been slowing down…. Tariffs are affecting everything…. We've had more and more people who have voted for (Trump) show up and say: 'This is not good, this is not what we voted for.'""

According to Starr, ""What’s happening in Jeffersonville is being mirrored across the Midwest.""

""In Kentucky, Michigan and elsewhere, global giants Toyota and Stellantis have spent billions of dollars in small communities, much of which came in the form of clean energy tax breaks from the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,"" Starr explains. ""Toyota's biggest production facility on the planet is in a small Kentucky town called Georgetown, where the company employs more than 10,000 people and has invested $11bn in the local economy since the late 1980s. These workers churn out nearly half a million vehicles and hundreds of thousands of engines every year…. In Indiana, one of the largest employers in the state, the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche is reportedly considering pulling out of $50bn worth of investment in the coming years if Trump follows through on his executive order to target companies that don’t reduce drug prices.""

Michael Hicks, who teaches economics at Ball State University, warns that economically, the worst is yet to come in the Midwest.

Hicks told The Guardian, ""So, the bulk of tariff price increases will hit in the coming months. This matters, because factory employment is a major share of rural counties in the Midwest — about 30 precent in Indiana, and similar in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. These things will clearly have a political effect, but my hunch is not fully for several months. Overlaying all this is the risk of a significant (economic) downturn, where tariffs combine with a financial bubble that would surely hit rural — red — communities very hard.""",https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=56556977&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C32%2C0%2C32,N,,2025-11-02 13:59:46.594990

Year by year, TAM Europe has regained its vitality and reemerged as an active player on the European manufacturing stage.
The newly launched 70 MPa hydrogen fuel low-entry city bus marks another milestone in TAM’s new energy production line.
The model integrates Hyundai’s hydrogen fuel cell system, hydrogen storage tanks, and power control system.
Some hydrogen fuel cell buses have entered operation in Seoul and Vienna.","As the morning light gilded the gates of Slovenia’s pillar automaker on the outskirts of Maribor, the country’s second-largest city, brand-new hydrogen fuel cell buses slowly rolled out of TAM Europe, marking the official rollout of the company’s latest clean-energy vehicles.

In late October, dozens of hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles were delivered from TAM Europe to Seoul, South Korea, and Vienna, Austria, the first batch of hydrogen-powered buses produced by the Slovenian manufacturer.

The company currently has an annual production capacity of 500 electric commercial vehicles. During the Paris Olympic Games, TAM Europe supplied 24 electric buses to Paris Charles de Gaulle International Airport. Over the next three years, it plans to produce around 100 hydrogen-powered vehicles annually.

Founded in 1947, the Maribor Automobile Factory (TAM) was once renowned for producing trucks, trailers, and military vehicles. However, severe challenges amid market changes and economic restructuring eventually forced the company into bankruptcy in 2011.

After the infusion of Chinese investment and technology, production resumed in 2013, and the company retained its original brand. Year by year, TAM Europe has regained its vitality and reemerged as an active player on the European manufacturing stage. It has become a driving force in advancing green and sustainable urban transport through its hydrogen and electric buses.

The newly launched 70 MPa hydrogen fuel low-entry city bus marks another milestone in TAM’s new energy production line. The model integrates Hyundai’s hydrogen fuel cell system, hydrogen storage tanks, and power control system. Emitting only water vapor during operation, it marked a major step forward in the decarbonization of urban mobility.

“Our breakthroughs in environmental protection and technology upgrading have been key to our entry into the high-end European market,” said TAM Europe CEO Ma Fuxiong, adding that the rollout demonstrates the factory’s sophisticated craftsmanship and lean management in complex new energy assembly.

“It fully embodies the forward-looking layout and strong cross-border collaboration driven by Chinese capital in global green technology and high-end manufacturing – a vivid example of how ‘Chinese wisdom’ connects with global resources,” Ma added.

Li Minghai, vice president for technology and manufacturing at TAM, highlighted the transformation brought by Chinese investment. He said that through strategic investment and resource integration, this green manufacturing project has gained strong momentum in the heart of Europe.

“It ensures efficiency at every stage – from technology alignment and supply chain management to production implementation,” Li said.

FuelCellsWorks, a professional platform for the hydrogen and fuel cell sector, analyzed in an article that the successful rollout carries dual significance: it consolidates TAM’s position as a European hub for specialty vehicles and new energy manufacturing, while also exemplifying the deep integration and synergy between Chinese capital and European industrial capabilities in green technology.

Some hydrogen fuel cell buses have entered operation in Seoul and Vienna. Li said, “Our brand recognition is growing steadily, with customers now across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.”

At present, the company employs nearly 200 local workers. It regularly sends local employees to its plant in China to learn new technologies, while Chinese technicians also visit the Slovenian plant to provide on-site guidance.

“This is not only the success of a company but also a testament to win-win cooperation in green development,” Li added.",https://www.macaubusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mb-logo@2x.png,N,,2025-11-02 17:18:37.552114

The global community has grown weary of the old-school fossil fuels that have ravaged the environment and resulted in catastrophic damage to the climate. The EU leaders came together recently at a summit to contemplate the impact of the geopolitical landscape on their electrification goals for the energy sector through renewable energy.

EU leaders are aiming to strengthen the region’s energy security and competitiveness

In a world dominated by calls for more work to be done in integrating the renewable energy sector into the global grid, Europe’s leaders have come together to discuss and plan the way forward for the continent in the energy biosphere. And the message is simple. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.

The overarching consensus among the litany of EU energy ministers is that Europe should keep to what is working and not aim to “simplify” the regulations for new wind projects. Introducing new policies may disrupt the already long line of new wind projects in approval limbo.

At the recent summit that brought together relevant stakeholders in Europe’s energy sector, they discussed a potential plan to fast-track the EU’s 2040 climate target, as well as any possible methods to simplify growth in the wind power sector.

The plan is to simplify the approval process for new wind power projects in European nations

That is the framework discussed between the litany of EU leaders that attended the summit. Europe needs to end the bureaucracy surrounding the approval process for new projects, which has become a serious problem as Europe sees a long list of projects navigating regulatory hurdles. The continent has become the spiritual home of the renewable energy sector, but leaders have lamented the slow progress made.

Wind power has emerged as the most cost-effective form of renewable energy production

Wind is cheap, readily available, and, most crucially, the kindest form of energy generation across the vast, potentially transformative renewable energy sector. For far too long, the world has stagnated in the embrace of wind and other renewable energy production methods. Now, Europe’s leaders have come together to figure out a new process that fosters a simpler regulation process.

Additionally, on the discussion table at the summit was also the EU’s 2040 greenhouse gas reduction target, which the EU leaders aim to agree on soon. Europe has needed to establish clear guidelines on how to effectively reduce the vast amounts of greenhouse gases being emitted by the continent’s energy sector.

Europe’s Electrification Action Plan will play a key role in reshaping the continent’s energy sector

The EU’s Electrification Action Plan is due to be released in the first quarter of 2026. As Europe grapples with rising costs and regulatory hurdles in the wind sector, the consensus among the EU’s leaders is that a more pragmatic approach is needed to foster growth in the wind power sector on the European continent.

While nuclear proponents like Friedman dismiss opposition to nuclear power as an artifact of the Cold War and media misinformation, there were reasons for those fears.","Swords or ploughshares?

That’s the dilemma that has plagued us since the sudden dawn of the nuclear age. Should we split atoms for peace or to rain destruction on our enemies? In the space of a single human life we’ve done both, killing hundreds of thousands in two atomic bomb attacks on Japan and then building nuclear reactors to provide light, power and medicine.

Radioactivity was discovered just more than a century ago, when Wilhelm Roentgen detected X-rays. In high school textbooks, most of us saw the ghostly radiograph of his wife Anna’s skeletal hand with wedding band, “Hand mit Ringen.” The image — the first X-ray — prompted Anna to remark, “I have seen my own death.” In 1913, science fiction writer H.G. Wells predicted both nuclear power and weaponry, in “The World Set Free.” In 1938, the trio of Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann were first to recognize that uranium atoms split when bombarded by neutrons. When physicist Leo Szilard confirmed fission, according to author Edward A. Friedman, he said ”the world was headed for sorrow.”

In 1939, Szilard and Albert Einstein sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt advising that fission could be used to create a powerful new bomb. The scientists feared the Nazis were already working on such a device, and their letter helped spur creation of the secret Manhattan Project, which eventually resulted to the test firing of the first atomic bomb in a remote part of New Mexico in 1945. Three weeks later came the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.

The Cold War began shortly after, and by 1949 our former allies, the Soviets, had their own nuclear weapon, too.

Later we created nuclear weapons stockpiles ready to kill hundreds of millions more and built dozens of nuclear generating plants to provide about 20% of the American electrical supply. One of those plants, Wolf Creek, owned by two regional utilities, has been online in Kansas since 1985.

Now comes a firm founded by one of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates, with the lure of bringing “advanced” nuclear power to Kansas. TerraPower announced a partnership last month with the state’s Department of Commerce and Evergy, one of the owners of Wolf Creek, to explore placing a natrium reactor somewhere in the utility’s service area of eastern Kansas.

TerraPower is already building a $4 billion pilot natrium reactor site in Wyoming, with half of the funding from the US Department of Energy. Some of the projected energy may power AI data centers. The company promises clean and safe power through its innovative technology, which uses molten salt (natrium is Latin for sodium) to cool the 345-megawatt reactor instead of water, as is done at Wolf Creek and every other commercial nuclear plant in the U.S.

A few Kansas communities in Evergy country have already tossed their hardhats in the ring to host the natrium reactor, including my home city of Emporia. The city commission, along with the county board and a regional development association, signed a letter of support for the project. Commissioners in Coffey County, home to the Wolf Creek plant, have also expressed interest, as have officials in Hutchinson.

TerraPower claims it will only place reactors where they are wanted, but there’s not been time for any substantive public discussion yet on the issue. Nobody asked Kansans whether we want a second nuclear plant or not. Another firm, Deep Fission, is working with an undisclosed partner to place reactors at the bottom of mile-deep holes in Kansas to supply power-hungry AI centers, but it’s not answering questions about details or whether it has sought state approval.

The gold rush for new nuclear is on.

We are, according to current U.S. policy, on the verge of a “new nuclear renaissance.” Old fears spawned by Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl are receding in popular memory. There is now public and bipartisan support for expanding nuclear power, according to a Pew Research Center poll.

It is understandable why leaders in a community like Emporia — which logged the state’s highest unemployment following the closure of Tyson meats — would find TerraPower’s projected 1,500 construction and 500 permanent jobs attractive.

But those vying to bring TerraPower jobs to their communities might want to cool their enthusiasm long enough to consider the safety and security risks presented by natrium reactors.

These risks were described to me by Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy group. Lyman is an expert on nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and safety and security. He’s also one of the authors of “Fukishima: The Story of a Nuclear Disaster.”

“I have signifcant concerns,” Lyman said, “related to safety and security as well as for the economics. … It’s inexplicable to me why there’s so much enthusiasm for this type of reactor.”

When I spoke with Lyman on Tuesday, he’d just finished monitoring a multi-day Nuclear Regulatory Commission advisory committee meeting reviewing the preliminary safeguard assessment of the TerraPower’s Wyoming reactor.

It is important to note that TerraPower refused my repeated requests for an interview. “TerraPower will have to politely decline participation in this opportunity at this time,” public relations specialist Brooke Leader said on behalf of the firm.

The problems with the natrium reactor, Lyman said, are inherent in the design of any sodium-cooled reactor. The molten sodium bursts into flame upon contact with air or water, he said, and these types of reactors have historically been expensive to build and prone to leaks. But, he said, the most worrying thing about the natrium reactor is that it uses fuel enriched to up to 20% of the isotope Uranium 235. This fuel is called HALEU, for high assay low enrichment uranium, and it’s just below the threshold for weapons-grade material.

Conventional nuclear reactors use fuel that is between 3 and 5% enriched.

Natrium reactors require HALEU to make them smaller and more efficient, Lyman said, but there is no domestic source of this fuel available in the quantities needed. In addition, security at natrium reactors would have to be beefed up compared with conventional reactors, because HALEU is attractive to terrorists and rogue states. Enriching uranium to 20% represents most of the effort required to make weapons-grade material.

In addition, there’s the problem — inherent with every reactor currently operating or planned in the United States — that there’s no long-term storage solution for spent fuel. Work on the Yucca Mountain geologic repository was halted in 2010. All waste is stored on-site, in cooling ponds and dry casks. It will remain hazardous for much longer than there has been recorded history — tens of thousands of years.

We can’t even keep the government running year-round or provide reliable food and health care to our poorest Americans. How can we expect to keep the distant future safe from us?

The immediate risk with a natrium reactor, Lyman said, is fire.

Molten sodium “is a highly reactive material, so you have to keep it away from the air and water at all costs,” Lyman said, “or you could end up with a sodium fire. And having a nuclear reactor where the coolant itself can catch on fire just sounds like a bad idea. It really is. So they have to go to extraordinary lengths to prevent any exposure of the coolant to air or water.”

This adds a level of unneeded complexity, he said. Even though TerraPower claims that natrium reactors are safer than light water-cooled reactors, Lyman said just the opposite is true. The time to respond to accidents is much shorter, he said, and there is no containment structure — the familiar dome-shaped vessel — as additional backup to contain leaks.

“The Department of Energy is trying, with Congress’s help, to stimulate and stand up a whole production program for this kind of (HALEU) material,” Lyman said. “But the demand is very unclear. The investments are on the order of billions and billions of dollars for an infrastructure to make this fuel. It’s a risky proposition, and it’s not clear that TerraPower is going to have the amount of fuel it needs just for the first plant.”

Because TerraPower would not speak to me, I will rely on author Edward A. Friedman, in his 2025 book “Nuclear Energy: boom, Bust, and Emerging Renaissance,” to make the case for next generation reactor technology.

“The promise for successful realization of (advanced) technology was significantly enhanced with the groundbreaking of the TerraPower sodium-cooled natrium reactor,” Friedman writes. Bills Gates’s company, TerraPower, began construction June 10, 2024, at Kemmerer, Wyoming, “of the natrium fast-neutron, liquid sodium-cooled reactor (SFR) that uses an associated liquid salt storage system. This fail-safe, small modular reactor (SMR) will be the first model in the world for cost-effective replacement of a coal-fired power plant with a nuclear reactor.”

The reactor is expected to become operational in 2030.

Gates hopes for hundreds of coal-to-nuclear transformations in the future, according to Friedman. Indeed, the vision of replacing fossil fuel that drove Gates to found TerraPower in the first place.

“There’s no scenario in which we keep adding carbon to the atmosphere and the world stops getting hotter,” Gates wrote in his 2021 book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.”

“The hotter it gets, the harder it will be for humans to survive, much less thrive,” Gates wrote.

Nuclear is the only carbon-free energy source, he said, that can reliably deliver power day and night through any type of weather on a large scale. It’s also one of the few practical ways to bring electricity to the poorest of countries, such as those found in sub-Saharan Africa. Access to energy is highly correlated to wealth and happiness.

“It’s no secret that nuclear power has its problems,” Gates wrote. “It’s very expensive to build today. Human error can cause accidents. Uranium, the fuel it uses, can be converted for use in weapons. The waste is dangerous and hard to store.”

Yet, nuclear represented our best hope of stopping global warming, he claimed. There was nothing more important than halting the rise in temperature if we were to avoid catastrophe.

Recently, Gates has changed his tune on climate.

In a memo to COP30, the United Nations climate change conference scheduled for next week in Brazil, Gates abandoned his previous “net zero” views. He criticized “doomsday” climate scenarios and suggested that people will be able to “live and thrive” in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future. It’s time to put “human welfare” at the center of climate strategies and improving agriculture and health in the poorest countries.

“Climate change is a serious problem,” he said, “but it will not be the end of civilization.”

The memo sounds like nothing short of a retreat from climate activism from a man who had spent personal billions on a quest for net zero. In the case of his push for advanced reactors, Gates may have been so driven by his desire to stop global warming that he swallowed the nuclear pill.

His sudden redirection must be having some effect on TerraPower, the company he founded. But his memo will have no effect on the U.S. delegation to COP30, because there will be no official American presence there. Donald Trump had already pulled the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. The world has now blown past the agreement’s 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global warming, with more climate suffering to follow.

Trump recently directed the United States to resume nuclear weapons testing, something we haven’t done since 1992. There is not yet a name for this arms race, but it is on as surely as the seas are rising. I am reminded of Damocles from Greek mythology, who was taught the dangers of power by the sword dangling above. So let us call this the Age of Damocles, because nothing is happy for those wracked by anxiety.

It is no coincidence that we embrace a new arms race at the same moment we accelerate the regulatory process to approve and deploy new types of nuclear reactors that use disturbingly enriched fuel. While nuclear proponents like Friedman dismiss opposition to nuclear power as an artifact of the Cold War and media misinformation, there were reasons for those fears. Troubling issues remain.

Opposition to nuclear power that curbed the U.S. nuclear power program from the 1980s until recently was based not only on fictional movies like 1979’s “The China Syndrome” but in real-life accidents like Fukishima in 2011, in which an earthquake and tsunami shut down the power grid and made it impossible to cool the reactors. More recently, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, has caused alarm because it’s been damaged and sometimes cut off in the ongoing war with Russia. Movies that might contain some inaccuracies, such as the 2019 HBO miniseries “Chernobyl,” are not causes of our nuclear jitters but expressions of them.

This is the global context in which we find ourselves pondering whether a new type of nuclear energy is good for Kansas or just a costly experiment that will risk accident or murderous mayhem. We live in a new period of global instability, one driven by all the old forces — greed, ignorance, haste, denial — that have plagued us since the ice receded. The communications from TerraPower have been carefully curated to present a sanitized version of a techno billionaire philanthropist’s dream of a nuclear renaissance.

I’m cold to the idea of spending billions on nuke plants to power, in large part, electricity-hungry AI data centers. It seems immoral when so many Americans go hungry and are without health insurance. Beyond that, there’s just too many unanswered questions about next-generation reactors.

But I’m opposed to the TerraPower plan for a natrium reactor in Kansas not because of the unknowns — where, how much, how long? — but because of what we do know. The HALEU fuel, in the amounts needed, presents an unacceptable risk of nuclear proliferation.

It’s about time, given that the average existing U.S. nuclear power plant was built based on 1980s technology.

A major reason for the virtual standstill in nuclear energy development in the U.S. was the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s near-maniacal effort to reassure a skittish public that they would not issue permits to any nuclear power plant that had the potential for public harm.

The shot heard round the world signaling a change in U.S. nuclear energy policy was the summary firing of NRC Commissioner Christopher Hanson, whose divinity school background may have contributed to a perception he viewed his job as more a gatekeeper for regulatory control than a partner in building a U.S. nuclear future.

As Senate Environment and Public Works Committee chair Shelley Moore Capito (R, WV) said, “For decades, the NRC took too long, cost too much, and did not have a predictable and efficient process to approve new licenses or modernize outdated regulations.”

Newly installed NRC Chair David Wright has called the Trump directives not “just regulatory reform” but a “cultural transformation that positions the NRC to be a forward-leaning, risk-informed regulator for the future.” The agency’s internal culture is being reshaped into a more efficient and modern agency without sacrificing public safety, Wright said.

But it’s not just the NRC that is being transformed. Under presidents from Carter to Biden, nuclear was largely relegated to the closet as the primary focus was the media-driven “green energy” crusade. Wind and solar permits were issued without the cleanup requirements and prepayments mandatory for nuclear and fossil fuel facilities. Nuclear was deemed “dirty.”

The first Trump term was so mangled by political infighting (both intra-party and cross-party) that any real nuclear energy agenda lay buried among the lawsuits. In the interim, however, artificial intelligence made giant leaps and the demand for electric power for fast-growing data centers was exploding. Wind and solar cannot be relied upon by entities dependent upon 24/7/365 power – and nuclear is still viewed as the “cleaner” option vis-à-vis natural gas.

Even before Trump’s reelection, tech giants were busily signing nuclear energy deals to power their data centers. Last September the owner of the long-shuttered Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear power plant announced plans to restart operations in 2027, thanks to a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft for a nearby AI data center.

Last October Amazon and Google both announced they would be investing in small modular reactors for AI data centers. Two months later Meta said it planned to follow suit. The amazing thing is the uncertainty that the SMR manufacturers will be able to deliver as quickly and as affordably as the tech giants demand. The simple reason? They have no track record yet. But energy demand is so high that waiting is not an option.

In the last few weeks, what was already a fast train picked up even more speed. On October 16 the U.S. Army unveiled its next-generation nuclear power Janus Program for the deployment of small modular reactors to support national defense installations and critical missions. Commercial microreactor manufacturers will partner with the Army’s Defense Innovation Unit with a goal of an operating reactor by September 30, 2028.

On October 26, Hyundai Engineering & Construction announced a basic design contract with Fermi America to construct four large nuclear reactors on a 8.1-square-mile property outside Amarillo, Texas. The Hyundai-designed AP1000 nuclear reactors will generate 4 GW for the HyperGrid complex, the world’s largest integrated energy and AI campus. The 11-GW project also includes 2 GW from small modular reactors, 4 GW from gas combined cycle plants, and 1 GW from solar and battery storage systems.

The integrated license application for the $500 billion project, the brainchild of former Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Fermi co-founder Toby Neugebauer, is currently under expedited review by the NRC. Meanwhile, Hyundai E&C is working on design tasks and preparations for the main construction phase, with finalization anticipated for an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract by spring 2026.

On October 28, Westinghouse Electric Co. joined Cameco Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management in a new strategic partnership with the U.S. government to accelerate the deployment of nuclear power. The government has committed to construction of at least $80 billion of new reactors using Westinghouse’s nuclear reactor technology to reinvigorate the U.S. nuclear power industrial base.

The government says this partnership will facilitate the growth and future of the U.S. nuclear power industry and the supporting supply chain. The entire project, which will deploy two-unit Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, is expected to create more than 100,000 construction jobs and support or sustain 45,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs across 43 states.

These are only a sampling of the active and planned contracts for nuclear power plant construction that have sprung out of the unplowed ground with the change in philosophy at the NRC and the White House. All systems are brightly lit green – but obstacles remain in the road.

Even with greatly shortened licensing timeframes, it will take time to complete site designs, obtain permits and licenses, and begin delivering much needed electricity to tech giants and other customers. Yet the biggest problem may be finding enough nuclear fuel at affordable prices to meet the mushrooming demand.

One option, says Curio CEO Ed McGinnis, is recognizing that spent nuclear fuel (including that from nuclear weapons) can safely be turned into fresh usable nuclear fuel and valuable rare metals and materials (like rhodium, palladium, krypton-85, and americium-241).

McGinnis, once a top nuclear energy official with the Department of Energy, says that only about 4% of the energy value has been used after five years of operation, and that fissioning uranium generates a plethora of other highly valuable isotopes that can be used for medical purposes, space exploration, and industrial processes.

Curio’s dry electrochemical and pyro-processing system separatees isotopes and fission products and also separates metallic elements like uranium and plutonium – each of which can be used as reactor fuels – enough, says McGinnis, to produce up to a third of the U.S. nuclear uranium feedstock a year from one facility. To boot, reprocessing dramatically shortens the half-life.

U.S. production of uranium oxide in 2024 jumped exponentially to 677,000 pounds from just 50,000 pounds in 2023, and exploration and development activities in 2023 were the highest in a decade. On a down note, anti-nuclear activists have been waging a campaign to shut down the White Mesa Mill in Utah that processes uranium ore – and in the U.S. today only about 5% of nuclear fuel has been processed domestically.

The nuclear fuel conundrum is but one of the obstacles in the path of the massive U.S. nuclear power industry growth that is also a vital component of the growth of AI data centers and other emerging electricity-hungry technologies that are shaping our future. But all systems are go – and that is the giant step that had to be taken first.

Europe has been warned by Hydrogen Europe that it is on track to miss its 2030 green hydrogen goal

Hydrogen Europe is an effective barometer for measuring the progress made in the sector, and the organization has warned Europe that it is way off the mark in meeting its self-imposed goals for increasing green hydrogen production by the end of the decade.

The EU bloc’s target of reaching 10 million tonnes of renewable H2 annually by 2030 has failed to materialize in the face of a slow and stagnating embrace of hydrogen on the continent. Europe planned to increase its hydrogen production to promote the renewable energy sector while also importing a further 10 million tonnes of renewable H2 in the years to follow 2030.

A lack of investment, as well as a less-than-favorable regulatory environment, has slowed the embrace of hydrogen in Europe

Hydrogen has emerged as the most efficient and promising form of renewable energy in a sea of possibilities. However, Europe has seen several regulatory hurdles slowing the adoption of the sector, which has led to a serious warning from Hydrogen Europe. Crucially, Europe will need to foster a more welcoming environment for potential investors and close the bureaucratic guardrails that have existed for generations.

Hydrogen Europe recently released its Clean Hydrogen Monitor 2025, and the outlook for the sector is not good at all

Hydrogen Europe recently released its annual Clean Hydrogen Monitor for this year, and the forecast is that Europe is lagging so far behind the pace of adopting the hydrogen sector that not even Usain Bolt could pick up the slack left behind by the continent.

EU member states have been hesitant to place any type of obligations or expectations on companies aiming to do business in the region, citing a less-than-ideal investment environment as well as concerns over market competitiveness. The report from Hydrogen Europe states that EU member states may need to reach out to import enough energy resources to meet demand as the cold winter months approach.

Europe needs to pick up the pace and develop the hydrogen sector into a dominant force in the energy industry

Several European nations have stepped up their game to advance the hydrogen sector, like Spain, which recently held discussions to acquire a stake in a French energy company’s project that would foster growth in the sector. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and deserves a lot more attention from the international energy sector.

Some European nations have invested in the hydrogen sector, but more needs to be done",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Depositphotos_572028600_XL-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 14:57:56.367332

Attorneys general in Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota targeted Small Refinery Exemptions over alleged manipulation. They accused small refiners of claiming economic hardship to obtain relief.

Additionally, they argued these exempt refiners tell investors they remain financially strong. Oklahoma Energy stakeholders monitor the push because refinery policy shifts impact fuel blending in Mid-Continent markets.

The fuel exemptions have been a flashpoint in renewable policy fights.

AG Letter to Regulators

AGs from Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota urge federal regulators to investigate small refineries for allegedly manipulating Small Refinery Exemptions by claiming they face economic hardship while telling investors they are thriving.

Meanwhile, these challenges place direct pressure on federal enforcement posture tied to the renewable fuel standard.

Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird sent a letter to federal regulators Thursday urging an investigation into refineries that receive exemptions for renewable fuel blending standards.

Additionally, this escalates Midwest political alignment against refinery exemption discretion.

Bird, who was joined by attorneys general from Nebraska and South Dakota in the letter, said some of the small refineries that are eligible for Small Refinery Exemptions are “manipulating” the program and feigning they face “disproportionate economic harm” while publicly telling investors they are “financially thriving.”

“The possibility that refineries are gaming the system to receive government handouts when they don’t need them hurts Iowa farmers,” Bird said in a statement. “They should be investigated by the federal government to ensure that all refiners are following the rules.”

Renewable Fuel Framework

Each year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets the renewable fuel standard which dictates a volume of renewable fuels that must be blended with, or must replace fossil fuels used for transportation, home heating and jet fuel.

Therefore, this remains one of the most contentious regulatory levers in liquid fuels.

Fuel refiners and importers satisfy these standards by either blending renewable fuels like ethanol or biodiesel into their products or by purchasing credits to offset the gas they produce.

Also, EPA compliance costs vary widely based on market structure, refinery configuration, and credit pricing.

Where Exemptions Fit

Under the same program, EPA allows refineries that handle less than 75,000 barrels of crude oil input each day to apply for Small Refinery Exemptions.

Additionally, this threshold remains the core dividing line between mandatory compliance and hardship application relief.

If the refinery shows it would experience “disproportionate economic hardship,” it can be exempted from complying with the renewable fuel standard.

Finally, demand destruction and legislative fights remain intense because every exemption affects the national blend pool.

October 29, 2025

My rubber boots squelched as I grabbed another 5-gallon bucket full of mud from a Wyoming Game and Fish Department herpetology technician. We performed an awkward handoff before I dumped the mud on the ground in front of my sinking boots. The squelching continued as I used my boots to mash the fresh mud up against willow branches woven among 4-inch-wide posts rammed in a streambed.

Our little team, the herpetology technician, a Trout Unlimited project manager and another volunteer like me, were finishing up the first in a series of nearly a dozen fake beaver dams on a creek on the west side of the Snowy Range Mountains in southeast Wyoming. They’re technically called beaver dam analogues — since with their complex patterns of sticks and mud, they’re supposed to imitate real beaver dams. Although I’m not sure my noisy rubber boots really compare to the efficacy of the beaver tail.

The dams’ purpose, as the name implies, is to slow streamflow, lightly flooding banks and providing the water more time to seep into the ground.

If we’re lucky, a family of beavers will come along and make this analogue their home, even tearing out our handiwork to construct something they like better that’s more permanent and sturdier. Beavers are, after all, professional furry engineers, who perfected their craft over millennia.

Our fake beaver dams aren’t meant to last forever. They’ll be maintained annually for about five years (unless real beavers take over earlier), but the result when established in the right place can be remarkable, restoring and rejuvenating wetlands, replenishing the water table, keeping water higher up in systems longer in the year, and providing habitat for everything from insects, frogs and toads to elk and moose, and yes, even beavers.

Stream restoration experts like Steve Gale, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s aquatic habitat biologist, can and do extoll the benefits of beavers and beaver dams. And while the rest of us standing in the stream bed see their utility, we also agreed with Gale when he said: “Who doesn’t want to play in the water with mud and sticks?”

Bigger than just beavers

Before European settlers streamed onto this continent, bringing an insatiable demand for beaver pelts, the rodents lived in streams, creeks and rivers almost everywhere. They dammed any flowing water they could find and had a hand in shaping large swaths of the nation.

While beavers can be a nuisance, falling ancient cottonwoods in parched areas and flooding creeks and irrigation ditches, they’re also one of the best examples of ecosystem engineers, Gale said, and their services have been missed. Without beavers and beaver dams, rivers run faster and cut down into the soil, they wash away sediment and move water faster from headwater states like Wyoming to other states downstream.

Biologists have tried reintroducing beavers across the country — the Army Corps of Engineers even famously airdropped beavers into an Idaho wilderness area — with mixed success.

So now watershed managers are turning to contraptions like the ones a team of nearly 20, including Game and Fish employees and volunteers from all over the state, helped build in mid-September.

We stood on the banks of the South Fork of Lake Creek in the Pennock Wildlife Habitat Management Area and listened to Gale walk us through the process. In the last few decades, the South Fork of Lake Creek had cut deeper and deeper into the earth, ultimately sinking lower than the floodplain and as a result offering little water to surrounding vegetation. When runoff hit each spring, the water rushed down as plants sat parched on the banks.

“We lost riparian habitat and riparian width, which is important for calving areas,” he said. “We’re doing this work primarily for the deer, elk and moose.”

Beavers had been reintroduced here before, but even the industrious rodents had a hard time building dams and ponds deep enough to keep them alive and safe through winter.

We were here to help, hopefully. We would spend the bulk of the day pounding posts made from trees across the width of the creek over a quarter-mile-long stretch and then weaving bendy willow branches through the posts. After building a wall of willows, we would use buckets of mud and sod to fill in the cracks. With any luck, water would begin backing up almost immediately, eventually filling and slowly trickling over the tops.

Life or death

As beaver dam analogues become increasingly popular, biologists with state agencies and nonprofits are teaming up to place them in streams across the landscape.

Austin Quynn, the Trout Unlimited project manager helping direct our team, worked with groups of youth corps members over the last couple summers building, maintaining and repairing hundreds of analogues on a stream called Muddy Creek southwest of Rawlinsto help habitat for four native fish species: flannelmouth and bluehead suckers, roundtail chubs and Colorado River cutthroat. Last summer, beavers came from miles downstream and tore out dozens of analogues in one stretch. He sounded amused that his work was destroyed, because in its place, they’d built a massive dam that must have been what the beavers wanted and needed.

Some of the dams blew out from spring runoff, scouring the creek bed of sediment and leaving behind gravel that cutthroat trout could use for spawning.

Deep pools created by the analogues — and eventually beavers themselves — also offer fish refuge from the heat on mid-summer days.

On the east side of the Snowy Range, Wendy Estes-Zumpf, Game and Fish’s herpetological coordinator, and others built eight analogues in a creek which contains one of the last boreal toad populations in southeast Wyoming. It had been a stronghold for the creatures, but in the absence of beavers, the creek became incised, leaving little wetland habitat for toads to breed and survive.

A few seasons after Estes-Zumpf’s team erected the fake beaver dams, boreal toad populations have started to come back. She counted as few as four toads on past spring surveys and found almost 30 this spring including multiple age classes.

Beaver dam analogues aren’t a silver bullet for a drought-stricken West, Gale said, but for some species and some creeks, they could be the difference between life and death.

Illinois Set to Lift Ban on New Nuclear Plant Construction

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker pledged to sign a sweeping clean energy bill that includes incentives for energy storage and removes the state’s ban on new large nuclear plants.

Pritzker said the bill creates market certainty for future generation developers and expands technology lanes for next-generation infrastructure. Supporters said large utility-scale storage paired with advanced nuclear gives utilities more dispatch optionality as peak load volatility grows.

Xcel Energy’s chronically troubled coal plant Comanche 3, scheduled for retirement by the end of 2030, hasn’t been working since mid-August and could be out of service until next summer.

The coal plant in Pueblo County experienced elevated vibration levels Aug. 12, resulting in an equipment malfunction and damage to the unit, Xcel Energy spokeswoman Michelle Aguayo said in an email. The company is working with consulting engineers to determine what caused the problem and to resolve it. Aguayo said Xcel won’t have an estimated time for returning the unit to service until the investigation is completed. “The preliminary working date for the unit’s return to service, however, is June of 2026.” With Comanche 3 out of service, Xcel is adjusting the operation of its other generating units, Aguayo said.

Cindy Schonhaut, director of the Colorado Utility Consumer Advocate office, said in an email that customers shouldn’t bear the burden of covering Comanche 3’s repair costs. And the costs of “replacement power should also not fall in the lap of customers,” she said. Ensuring safe and reliable power is at the forefront of the utility’s responsibility, Schonhaut said. To the extent that Comanche 3 being down affects Xcel’s ability to meet that responsibility, the advocate’s office “has a heightened sense of concern.” The advocate’s office, which represents the public before the PUC, said it will review Xcel’s cost-recovery requests submitted to the PUC.

Comanche 3 is one of three units on the 700-acre campus of Xcel Energy’s coal-fired generating power station about 11 miles southeast of Pueblo. One unit was closed in 2022 and another will be shut down this year. The third unit, which would be Xcel’s last coal plant, is scheduled to close by the end of 2030. Xcel, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has proposed replacing the coal plant with wind and solar power, battery storage and natural gas generation.

Comanche 3 started operating in 2010 and originally was expected to run until 2070, but it has been plagued with problems and has experienced numerous outages through the years. A 2021 report by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission said the coal unit averaged 91.5 days per year of outages over a decade and was out of commission for all but a handful of days in 2020. A quarterly report by Xcel to the PUC showed eight outages at Comanche 3 in July.

The unit has been “a problem child” from the beginning, said Parks Barroso, an attorney and Colorado Clean Energy Manager for the conservation organization Western Resource Advocates. “I think the Xcel system in Colorado has been planning for a life without Comanche 3 for quite a while now and the system and the renewables on the system have shown that we can meet the system needs without that coal unit,” Barroso said.

Other Xcel Energy coal plants struggled to stay online this summer, according to an analysis by the PUC staff. The report highlighted what Xcel called a “code orange” event, meaning there was a realistic possibility of not having enough power to meet the demand for electricity. The utility asked customers to conserve energy Aug. 7 to avoid managed, rotating blackouts.

The PUC staff said factors that contributed to strain on the electric grid that day included significant outages at other fossil-fuel power plants, sustained high temperatures and lower-than-typical renewable power production levels. Over 80% of the power that was unavailable on the Xcel system Aug. 6-9 was associated with coal resources, the PUC staff said. Eleven units experienced unplanned outages.

Erin O’Neill, the PUC’s deputy director of fixed utilities, attributed some of the issues to the fact that the coal plants are being phased out. “We have been trying to make sure we don’t overinvest on maintenance on units that are being converted to other fuel or are reaching their retirement date,” O’Neill said during a recent PUC meeting.

Although the renewable energy generation levels were lower than what’s typical for the time of year, Neill said in an email that they were consistent with the levels used by planners looking to meet demands during peak periods.

However, Xcel Energy overall was short 643 megawatts of its planning target for the summer, or the amount of electricity needed to meet anticipated demands. The target includes a reserve margin to cover possible outages or other contingencies. A one-megawatt facility could power about 340 homes.

The PUC report said that responses to Xcel’s call for conservation Aug. 7 saved about 525 megawatts of electricity during the hours of peak demand. The measures included people using smart thermostats to lower the draw on air conditioning and commercial customers lowering demand.

Aguayo said Xcel Energy has taken several steps through the years to meet the growing need for more resources, including expanding power plants, approving short-term extensions of agreements with other power providers and a recent request to speed up approval of renewable energy projects to take advantage of federal incentives being phased out.

For Amy Wright, policies coming out of the White House are having a clear effect on residents of rural Ohio.","For decades, a line of storefronts in Jeffersonville, Ohio, a town of 1,200 people 40 minutes south-west of Columbus, lay empty.

But now locals are hard at work renovating the downtown and paving streets in anticipation of a potential economic boom fueled by a huge new electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant.

Two miles south of Jeffersonville, Korean and Japanese companies LG Energy Solution and Honda are in the midst of sinking $3.5bn into a facility that is expected to begin production in the coming months.

Hundreds of people have been employed in the construction of the plant, and more than 525 people have been hired to work in engineering and other manufacturing roles at the facility. In total, about 2,200 people are expected to be employed on a site that, until several years ago, was open farmland.

But some locals are concerned.

A host of Trump administration policies – tariff measures and the end of clean vehicle tax credits worth thousands of dollars to car buyers – are causing multinational manufacturing companies to consider pausing hundreds of millions of dollars in future investments, a move that would hit small, majority-Republican towns such as Jeffersonville especially hard.

Moreover, a raid by ICE immigration officers on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Ellabell, a small town in south-east Georgia in September that saw more than 300 South Korean workers detained and sent home has sent shock waves through places like Jeffersonville and the C-suites of international companies alike.

“The construction process has been slowing down. My fear is that the whole thing is going to stop, and we’re left with just unfinished concrete out there,” says Amy Wright, a Fayette county resident, of the under-construction battery plant.

“What’s more, a lot of the people hired to do the construction of the plant are not locals. They are from out-of-state; I’ve met them at the gym.”

While in last year’s presidential election, 77% of voters in Fayette county backed Trump, recent polls suggest his popularity in rural America has taken a nosedive.

One poll suggests that his approval rating among rural Americans has slipped from 59% in August to 47% in October. Others chart his net approval rating in states he won in last year’s presidential election – Ohio, Michigan and Indiana – in negative territory by as much as 18.9 points.

Wright says her son, who works for a local company that supplies Honda with parts, recently received notice that a prior promise of overtime work was being rescinded. She says she believes Honda is reeling in spending due to US government policies.

“Tariffs are affecting everything,” says Wright.

What’s happening in Jeffersonville is being mirrored across the midwest.

In Kentucky, Michigan and elsewhere, global giants Toyota and Stellantis have spent billions of dollars in small communities, much of which came in the form of clean energy tax breaks from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Toyota’s biggest production facility on the planet is in a small Kentucky town called Georgetown, where the company employs more than 10,000 people and has invested $11bn in the local economy since the late 1980s. These workers churn out nearly half a million vehicles and hundreds of thousands of engines every year.

However, in August Toyota warned that it faced a $9.5bn financial hit to it and its suppliers due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, the largest estimate of any automotive manufacturer. In July, Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, said Trump’s tariffs were undermining investments in the state such as Toyota’s, calling them “chaos”.

Sixty-three per cent of voters in Georgetown’s Scott county backed Trump in last year’s presidential election.

Last April, Stellantis laid off 900 workers at locations across the midwest due to Trump’s tariffs.

In Indiana, one of the largest employers in the state, the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche is reportedly considering pulling out of $50bn worth of investment in the coming years if Trump follows through on his executive order to target companies that don’t reduce drug prices.

“No [manufacturer] wanted to alienate customers, but those days are past. So, the bulk of tariff price increases will hit in the coming months. This matters, because factory employment is a major share of rural counties in the midwest – about 30% in Indiana, and similar in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin,” says Michael Hicks, an economist and professor at Ball State University in Indiana.

“These things will clearly have a political effect, but my hunch is not fully for several months. Overlaying all this is the risk of a significant [economic] downturn, where tariffs combine with a financial bubble that would surely hit rural – red – communities very hard.”

Still, others believe that the tariffs will benefit small American towns in the long run.

“Toyota is doing fine and I don’t see [tariffs] as being a big hurt for us here in Georgetown,” says Robert Linder, co-owner of the Porch restaurant that’s situated a mile north of the huge facility, and who worked at the plant for 29 years.

In April, Toyota suggested it might move more vehicle production to Georgetown to beat the tariffs, though that move could be years in the making. Sales of Toyota brands in the US have been growing this year, with the company thus far eating the cost of tariffs rather than passing it on to consumers.

“They just announced a $10bn investment in the United States for more Toyota plants. If Toyota was worried about [tariffs] they wouldn’t be expanding,” says Linder. Recent reports, however, suggest the $10bn figure referred to previously announced investments.

However, large multinationals have a track record of announcing major projects only for reality to play out in a very different way.

In Wisconsin, the Taiwanese tech company Foxconn claimed it would spend $10bn on a facility outside the town of Mount Pleasant. Instead, local taxpayers today find themselves on the hook for $1.2bn spent on highways, attorneys and other infrastructure for a facility that has never transpired.

In Arizona, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), backed directly by Trump, has been plagued with lawsuits related to safety and other issues, and missed project deadlines following promises to become a major employer of local talent.

Despite Ohio’s governor, Mike DeWine, recently claiming there was no need to worry about the future of the LG-Honda battery plant, on 28 October, Honda announced it was reducing production at plants across Ohio due to a semiconductor chip shortage.

While more than two dozen jobs are available at the Jeffersonville site, according to the LG-Honda plant’s hiring website, it’s a far cry from the more than 2,000 positions cited by officials previously.

For Amy Wright, policies coming out of the White House are having a clear effect on residents of rural Ohio. As an organizer of four local No Kings protests against Trump’s policies she’s noticed a change in the people who are coming to the rallies.

“We’ve had more and more people who have voted for [Trump] show up and say: ‘This is not good, this is not what we voted for,’” she says.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/832f791a27ccbc1298ed44a6d0c2add30e52fb76/381_0_3813_3050/master/3813.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0122c2a1fc32a95437c5f185fde65d4e",N,,2025-11-02 08:59:30.090431

Anish Thakkar and Patrick Walsh met nearly twenty years ago at the University of Illinois. Back then, they weren’t dreaming of building the world's largest off-grid solar company. They were just two curious students trying to make a difference in entirely different ways.

Patrick was deep in engineering, working on a nonprofit project in India through Engineers Without Borders. He was in the state of Orissa, building biofuel microgrids for villages that had never known what steady electricity felt like.

Anish was walking a different path. He was running a nonprofit called Illini 4000, a student-run cycling organisation raising funds for families battling cancer across the U.S. His work was about people, about finding light in dark times, in the most human sense.

But their paths crossed in a tech lab, where Patrick was drilling holes into PVC tubes, fitting LEDs through them, and experimenting with how to build a prototype solar-powered lantern he could actually sell to families in India who didn’t have electricity.

Anish was drawn in, not just by the idea, but by its humanity. “It was the first time I realised,” he says now, “that engineering could do more than design gadgets. It could change lives.”

That small dream would grow into Sun King, the world's largest off-grid solar company, powering over 100 million lives across Africa and Asia.

From prototype to purpose

By 2007, the idea had outgrown the lab, and SunKing was born. The goal was to design solar products that worked for off-grid homes, were cheap, and reliable.

But the dream was fragile. They had prototypes, ambition, and not much else.

""We realised early on that just having the right product wouldn’t solve the problem. We also need a way to reach the people who need it most. And you need to make it affordable.” Anish narrated.

ADVERTISEMENT

That realisation changed everything. Anish quit his consulting job at ZS Associates and went all in. Funding was needed, and he was bold enough to go looking for it in unusual places.

The first yes

At his company's 25th anniversary party, Anish spotted one of ZS Associates’ co-founders, Dr. Prabha Sinha, across the room.

He cornered him and gave him a one-minute pitch. “He asked if I was still an employee,” Anish laughed. “I told him no, I had quit a week earlier and was moving to India to start this business.”

Sinha, who had grown up in India studying under kerosene lamps himself, understood the problem he presented. He didn’t just believe in it, he backed it. Sinha later became their first seed investor, and he has stayed a mentor and board member ever since.

“That was the validation we needed,” Anish said. “Someone who had lived through that experience believed in us, and in the idea that a for-profit social business could make energy accessible to everyone.”

Patrick nods. “It’s been crucial that Anish and I remain in control of the board, founders still directing the mission, without decision-making being overly diluted. That’s how we’ve stayed true to what we set out to do.”

With that early support, they set up operations in Mumbai and built a direct sales network to distribute their first Sun King solar lamps to rural families.

Soon, their network of Sun King Saathis (local agents) was delivering solar light across Indian villages. From there, they looked west.

Building across borders

Their next frontier was Africa, where the need was massive. Nearly 600 million Africans live without access to electricity. But affordability was the real challenge. Most families simply couldn’t afford to pay up front, even for something that would change their lives.

So they flipped the model. Sun King invented its own financing system — pay-as-you-go solar (PAYG). Customers could pay small amounts daily or weekly through mobile money or cash collection. As long as they paid, the lights stayed on. Eventually, they owned the system outright, and it changed everything.

Today, Sun King operates the world’s largest direct-to-consumer PAYG solar distribution network, having provided over $1.3 billion in solar loans to homes and small businesses.

SunKing has connected 25 million households, adding over 300,000 new users every month, and installed 195 MW of solar capacity across 11 African countries.

“What started as a product company became a full financing and service ecosystem,” Anish said.

Funding the future

Raising money for climate tech in Africa hasn’t always been easy. The space has grown, but it’s still catching up to the urgency of the need.

In 2025, though, the tide is shifting. Africa: The Big Deal reports that 39% of all startup funding this year, out of $2.2 billion total, went to climate-focused startups.

Sun King has been a key player in that movement. The company has raised over $400 million in equity and $300 million in debt.

“We used to think we’d always depend on foreign investors. But that’s changing fast. We’ve now raised over $450 million in local currency debt from African banks, Stanbic, Absa, and others. That’s huge.” Patrick said.

Those loans directly power solar purchases for millions of customers in shillings, kwacha, and naira.

“It’s no longer just donor money or Western capital,” Anish adds. “It’s African banks fueling Africa’s green transition.”

Their landmark $156 million local-currency securitisation in Kenya, the largest in Sub-Saharan Africa outside South Africa, proved just how far that model could go.

“The key was showing banks that solar customers are incredibly reliable. In some cases, their repayment rates are stronger than those of higher-income borrowers. That helped unlock major financing for Africa’s clean energy future,” Anish said.

Patrick calls it “a quiet revolution in finance. “Securitisation is something you usually see in advanced economies. Now it’s helping rural families in Kenya and Nigeria access cheaper solar power. That’s transformative,” he said.

Local light, local hands

For companies serving a market as vast as Africa, the question often arises. Should production stay global, or come home?

Sun King just took the local route, opening its first major manufacturing hub in Nairobi, Kenya.

The facility will assemble solar-powered televisions and smartphones built to work seamlessly with Sun King’s off-grid systems. With a starting capacity of 700,000 units annually, and room to scale, it’s a major leap toward a fully localised supply chain.

Patrick said plans are also underway to set up a local assembly plant in Nigeria, producing not only solar kits but also the appliances they power, TVs, radios, and refrigerators, designed for homes where electricity remains unreliable.

“We’re building the next generation of green jobs,” said Anish. “Over 35,000 field agents, 3,000 employees. That’s 38,000 careers created. These are the green energy jobs of the future.”

Patrick added proudly, “Ninety-nine per cent of our 3,000 employees are African. That’s not by accident. It’s the whole point.”

When they talk about their two-decade partnership, both men smile before they speak.

“It’s trust,” Patrick said simply. “We’ve been through good times and brutal ones. He’s one of the most important people in my life.”

Anish nods. “It’s been an incredible journey. From soldering solar lanterns in a campus lab to powering millions of homes. But the mission is still the same: light every home that needs it.”

That friendship has become Sun King’s quiet backbone, shaping a company culture built on humility, long-term thinking, and shared purpose. “We just feel privileged to work with people who care this deeply,” Patrick said.

As the US tariff landscape continues to evolve, the implications for energy markets across the Americas are profound.

Designed to bolster domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports, the tariffs have inadvertently led to significant disruptions in clean energy supply chains.

As such, the tariffs are expected to complicate the renewable energy transition across the Americas, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.

GlobalData’s latest report, “North and South America Renewable Energy Policy Handbook 2025,” reveals the US tariffs have created ripples across the country and has affected trade dynamics within the American continent.

Energy producers, suppliers, and consumers need to remain flexible in adapting to these changes, which requires a revaluation of supply chain strategies, contractual arrangements, and domestic production capabilities.

Sudeshna Sarmah, Power Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The tariffs expansion has introduced punitive duties on a range of clean energy components, including solar modules, wind turbines, transformers, and battery-related parts. While the intention behind the tariffs is to stimulate domestic production, the reality is that the current manufacturing capacity in the US falls short of meeting the burgeoning demand for utility-scale developments. This mismatch has resulted in inflated prices and significant delays in project timelines.”

The tariffs have also strained regional trade relationships, particularly with Canadian and Mexican exporters.

The imposition of stringent domestic content and origin requirements has led to punitive duties on cross-border transactions, complicating energy cooperation initiatives.

Q: How did your family and your background as a Muslim South Asian woman shape your love of the outdoors?
As I got older, I started making my way back to the outdoors.
Why are you making the outdoors political?” It’s consistently white people who say that.","Author, activist, and outdoorswoman Ambreen Tariq was born in India but found her passion in the American wilderness.

A 42-year-old senior program director at the nonprofit educational organization Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, Tariq started camping with her family after they immigrated to Minnesota when she was 8 years old.

Later, she moved to Wayne, New Jersey, where she went to high school and adopted what she calls an exemplary Garden State accent. Now based in Washington, D.C., the nonpracticing attorney, who worked for both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Labor, is a well-known outdoors activist who started the website @BrownPeopleCamping, among other pursuits.

She also wrote a semi-autobiographical children’s book, Fatima’s Great Outdoors, which follows a young girl from an immigrant family as they embark on their first camping trip in the Midwest.

Q: Why did you start @BrownPeopleCamping?

A: I’ve always been super passionate about environmental justice, which is the concept that low-income communities, and often people of color, bear the brunt of environmental degradation and environmental crimes. But in all those spaces, whether it was law school, working at the EPA, or even a climate march, it’s so predominantly white.

The country’s demographics are moving in a completely different direction. And that’s the problem: If we had to pass the Clean Water Act of 1972 now, it wouldn’t pass. There isn’t enough people power. So for me, a clear link between the two problems is that if you’re not falling in love with nature, you’re never going to stand up and fight for it.

It became obvious that there needs to be a bigger push for folks who identify with me to be represented. That got me started with @BrownPeopleCamping.

At first, it was really tongue in cheek. I wanted people to ask why I named it that, so we could have the conversation. And I went in with a pretty simple formula: I love photography and I love telling stories, so I’m just going to be my own storyteller. It doesn’t need to be complicated. I’m going to say what I saw, why I like it, and why I want more people to come out and experience it. Let’s talk about why the outdoors looks the way it does, who’s not out there and why, and how we change that.

Q: How did your family and your background as a Muslim South Asian woman shape your love of the outdoors?

A: We stumbled into camping when we came to the United States because we were trying to learn how to be American, and in Minnesota, the outdoors is a huge part of the culture. We were like, “This is what we do now. We’re American.”

But I think regardless of where you are on the economic spectrum, being an immigrant is really f—ing hard, especially for children. For me, it was such a difficult time. But when we went outdoors, it was calm. And when I look at memories of my childhood, when my parents were smiling or laughing, I think about when we went camping. I can’t imagine we went more than five times, but it became this rallying point in my brain — this feeling that when I’m out there, all I have to do is adventure, discover, be curious and just be a kid.

It became a very sentimental lighthouse for me. No other part of our lives was like that. We were latchkey kids. My parents worked two jobs each.

As I got older, I started making my way back to the outdoors. And it was almost startling as an adult to be like, “Whoa, I feel like I’m a 10-year-old in Minnesota again.” Every part of my life is drenched with diversity. Nothing is homogeneous. But when I went camping, it was a time warp. The country had changed, but that hadn’t. As a grown adult, I don’t have to just accept things the way I see them.

Q: Why don’t more people of color enjoy the outdoors?

A: As an immigrant, I have a different relationship to the land. I’m trying to gain entrance. I don’t really have a sense of possession or entitlement. It’s not mine; it never was. I don’t have lineage here.

But Indigenous peoples’ relationships are very complicated. It was theirs, and it was taken away. Period. And the places where we recreate, national and state parks, hold a lot of historic pain of displacement.

Then you look at the African American community, which was brought here to work the land but denied rights to own it, recreate on it or even be safe on it. There’s also this history of “bad things happen to Black people in the woods.”

So, depending on where you come from, your relationship to the land is very different, as are the stories told to you or the fear associated with it.

And inevitably, you still have to overcome the discomfort of, “I’m the only one out here who looks like me.” Plus, there’s a bar to entry with knowledge, equipment, and culture, which can deter people. A big part of breaking down those barriers is creating spaces where people can feel safe, explore, and try something on their own.

Q: So how do you fix that?

A: Familiarity is important. For example, when I got my gun license, I knew nothing about gun culture. But I saw a class about women in shooting and thought, “You know what? I want to go in there and explore because I feel really uncomfortable in a completely male-dominated space.”

It’s so intimidating. But it made me comfortable to go to this class for women. I could relax. It was daunting, but the minute I saw someone I related to, I said, “OK, maybe this is possible for me too.”

That’s a good parallel to the outdoors. If you’re new to it and people from your walk of life aren’t there, you feel unfamiliar, and it can be intimidating. But when you see someone who looks like you, who you can identify with, that changes things.

And there are so many groups doing this exact work, trying to make a space for people to feel safe, explore, and connect. I highly recommend people go out with groups that make a welcoming space for newcomers — local and county recreation centers, the Sierra Club, even faith-based groups that organize outings. There are so many resources.

You can also go on social media and find those groups. Even if you don’t want to go out with them, you’ll feel like you’re part of a community that’s encouraging you to explore. That’s the psychological support everybody needs.

Q: How have people responded to this? I hear you’ve gotten some pretty heinous messages.

A: That’s been the greatest surprise for me. It’s rare, but when I see ignorant comments, it’s not enough for me to say, “Oh, that’s just a crazy person.” It’s not. It’s a person with an opinion who probably represents 50 others who think the same way, and to ignore it would go against the work I’m trying to do. I genuinely want to understand what it is about what I do that angers someone.

The most extreme comments are just white supremacy. It’s nativism — “This is my land, get the f— out.” Then there’s the middle resistance, which sounds like, “Why are you playing the race card? Why are you making the outdoors political?” It’s consistently white people who say that.

So I tell them, “Put yourself in a time and place where you’ve been a minority.” Often, the people who respond that way have never experienced that. It’s not personal, and I’ll never lose sleep over those comments because they don’t know me. It’s more of an expression of where they are.

There’s a large swath of people in this country who are emotionally suffering. They’ve been led to believe they were going to grow up and have this country be a certain way, but politics is pointing to people of color as the reason they don’t have that — money, resources, power or land.

It’s the age-old manipulation of racism to make people believe minorities are causing all their problems when that has nothing to do with it. It’s ignorance laced with fear.

But it makes me laugh when people say, “Why do you have to make the outdoors political?” My response is, land is the single most political thing in the history of the planet Earth. So I’m not going to tell you what to think, but I am going to share stories with you. I’m going to tell you how I feel and how I think. Maybe that will help us understand each other better.",https://jerseyvindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10746622288_IMG_7179-2a.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 11:04:19.532570

Daimler Truck North America, International Motors, Paccar and Volvo Group North America sued the California Air Resources Board in federal court this past August, seeking to invalidate the Clean Truck Partnership emissions reduction deal they signed with the state in 2023 to move away from traditional trucks and toward zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). The main point of the lawsuit was that, because the incoming Trump Administration rolled back Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policies that had previously given individual states the right to set their own environmental and emissions laws, the truck makers shouldn’t have to honor the deals signed with individual states.

“Plaintiffs are caught in the crossfire: California demands that OEMs follow preempted laws; the United States maintains such laws are illegal and orders OEMs to disregard them,” the lawsuit reads. “Accordingly, Plaintiff OEMs file this lawsuit to clarify their legal obligations under federal and state law and to enjoin California from enforcing standards preempted by federal law.”

After several weeks of waiting for a response, we finally have one: CARB is suing the OEMs right back, claiming that the initial suit proves the signing manufacturers, “(have) unambiguously stated that they do not intend to comply.”

In its lawsuit, CARB argues that monetary damages alone would not make the people of the State of California whole as far as damages are concerned, citing that the stated goal of the 2023 Clean Truck Partnership was, “to achieve emissions reductions that cannot be measured strictly in financial terms,” according to ACT-News.

The agency is asking the court to compel the truck companies to perform on their 2023 obligations or, failing that, to allow CARB to rescind the contract and recover its costs. A hearing on the truck makers’ request for a preliminary injunction was held Friday, with another court date set for November 21, when CARB will seek to dismiss the case brought forth by the truck brands.

The Xi-Trump rare earth deal represents a pivotal moment in global supply chain diplomacy, establishing a temporary framework that addresses immediate tensions while exposing deeper structural vulnerabilities. This 12-month agreement, announced during the Busan Summit on October 30, 2025, creates breathing room for manufacturers while highlighting the urgent need for supply chain diversification and demonstrating how energy security trends continue to shape international relations.

Key Details of the Xi-Trump Rare Earth Agreement

Agreement Element Details Duration 12-month suspension period Scope Chinese rare earth export restrictions to US Announcement Date October 30, 2025 (Busan Summit) Trade Context Part of broader tariff reduction negotiations Strategic Impact Temporary stabilization of critical mineral supply

The agreement's significance extends beyond bilateral trade relations, affecting global manufacturing networks dependent on these essential materials. For technology manufacturers, defense contractors, and clean energy companies, this temporary stabilisation provides crucial planning certainty while underscoring long-term vulnerability to supply concentration in a single nation.

How China's Export Controls Created Global Supply Chain Disruption

The Strategic Leverage of Rare Earth Dominance

China's commanding position as controller of approximately 90% of global rare earth supply transformed these minerals into powerful geopolitical instruments. When Beijing implemented export licensing requirements in October 2025, the ripple effects immediately disrupted international manufacturing networks across multiple critical sectors.

The implementation of these controls demonstrated how quickly strategic minerals can become tools of economic statecraft. Manufacturing facilities worldwide faced unprecedented uncertainty regarding material availability, forcing companies to reassess supply chain strategies that had operated seamlessly for decades. Furthermore, this development aligned with broader global mining trends that emphasise strategic mineral concentration.

""Critical industries including electric vehicle production, smartphone manufacturing, and defense contractors experienced immediate supply uncertainty, with manufacturing operations requiring rapid adjustment to licensing-dependent material flows.""

Elements Beyond the Headlines: Strategic Limitations

The Xi-Trump rare earth deal contains significant exclusions that reveal its tactical rather than strategic nature. Understanding these limitations proves essential for assessing the agreement's actual impact on supply chain security.

Heavy Rare Earth Elements Remain Controlled

Dysprosium and terbium licensing unchanged

Samarium export permits still required

Magnet-grade materials face continued restrictions

Processing Equipment Restrictions Persist

Refining technology exports remain limited

Separation equipment licensing unchanged

Downstream manufacturing tools still controlled

These exclusions highlight the agreement's selective nature, addressing only October's incremental restrictions while maintaining fundamental controls over the most strategically important materials. This selective approach preserves China's leverage over critical supply chains despite diplomatic headlines suggesting broader resolution.

America's Tactical Wins vs. China's Strategic Positioning

Comparative Outcomes from the Deal

United States Gains China's Strategic Maintains 12-month export stability Control over heavy rare earths Reduced tariffs on agricultural products Licensing authority over critical elements Nexperia chip shipment clearance Midstream processing dominance Fentanyl cooperation progress Long-term supply chain leverage

The United States secured tangible short-term benefits through this transactional approach, obtaining immediate relief for manufacturers while addressing broader trade relationship concerns. The clearance for Nexperia chip shipments represents diplomatic pragmatism, though industry analysts suggest this gesture carries more symbolic than strategic significance.

Agricultural tariff reductions provide American farmers with expanded market access, demonstrating how rare earth negotiations interconnect with broader economic relationships. The inclusion of fentanyl cooperation progress indicates both nations' recognition that economic and security issues require integrated solutions. These dynamics reflect ongoing US‑China trade impact concerns that continue to shape global markets.

The European Union's Spectator Status

Brussels received diplomatic assurances rather than concrete supply guarantees, highlighting fundamental asymmetries in negotiating leverage. The EU's response characterising the suspension as appropriate and responsible masks underlying structural weaknesses in rare earth dependency.

Europe's exclusion from substantive negotiations reflects its lack of bilateral trade tools comparable to America's tariff leverage. Without significant transactional capabilities or alternative supply arrangements, the EU remains dependent on diplomatic engagement rather than economic bargaining power in rare earth discussions.

Why Europe was excluded from Xi-Trump rare earth negotiations: Europe lacks the bilateral trade leverage that enabled US-China negotiations. Without significant tariff tools or alternative supply arrangements, the EU remains dependent on diplomatic engagement rather than transactional bargaining power in rare earth discussions.

How Rare Earth Elements Power Modern Technology and Defence Systems

The 17 Elements That Define Technological Supremacy

Consumer Technology Applications

Smartphone displays require europium and terbium for colour accuracy and efficiency

Electric vehicle motors depend on neodymium and dysprosium for high-performance magnets

Wind turbine generators use praseodymium and samarium for energy conversion

Military and Aerospace Dependencies

Fighter jet guidance systems utilise yttrium compounds for precision navigation

Missile technology requires specialised rare earth alloys for targeting systems

Satellite communications depend on lanthanide elements for signal processing

The concentration of these materials in military applications creates strategic vulnerabilities that extend beyond commercial manufacturing. Defence systems require consistent material specifications, making supply disruption particularly challenging for military readiness and equipment maintenance.

""Advanced fighter aircraft contain substantial rare earth materials across guidance systems, communications equipment, and engine components, demonstrating the strategic vulnerability created by supply chain concentration in a single nation.""

What Are the Long-Term Implications for Global Supply Chain Security?

Building Alternative Supply Networks

The temporary nature of the Xi-Trump rare earth deal emphasises urgent needs for supply chain diversification strategies that extend beyond diplomatic solutions. Multiple regions are developing alternative production capabilities, though meaningful capacity remains years away. In addition, initiatives like Australia's critical minerals reserve demonstrate national efforts to address supply security concerns.

Emerging Production Regions

Australian mining operations expanding processing capabilities beyond extraction

Canadian rare earth projects advancing through development phases

African mineral deposits attracting international investment for exploration

Recycling and Alternative Technologies

Urban mining from electronic waste streams gaining commercial viability

Substitute materials research accelerating across industrial applications

Circular economy approaches reducing virgin material dependence

Investment Opportunities and Strategic Risks

Rare Earth Investment Landscape Post-Agreement

Investment Category Risk Level Strategic Considerations Chinese rare earth stocks Medium Stable short-term returns, geopolitical exposure Alternative supply projects High Significant development time, regulatory complexity Recycling technologies Medium Growing market demand, technical challenges Substitute material research High Revolutionary potential, uncertain timelines

Investment strategies must balance immediate opportunities against long-term supply chain transformation. The 12-month agreement window provides time for alternative supply development while maintaining awareness of continued Chinese market dominance.

How This Deal Impacts Electric Vehicle and Clean Energy Markets

Stabilising Green Technology Supply Chains

The Xi-Trump rare earth deal provides temporary relief for clean energy manufacturers facing material cost volatility and supply uncertainty. This stabilisation proves particularly crucial for sectors experiencing rapid expansion while dependent on rare earth-intensive technologies.

Electric Vehicle Sector Benefits

Motor magnet production schedules stabilised through reduced licensing uncertainty

Battery material supply chains experience reduced pressure from export restrictions

Manufacturing planning horizons extended for production capacity expansion

Renewable Energy Infrastructure

Wind turbine production schedules secured through temporary material availability

Solar panel component supply chains improved despite continued processing restrictions

Grid storage technology development continues with reduced material constraints

The clean energy transition's dependence on rare earth materials makes supply chain security essential for climate objectives. This temporary agreement provides breathing room while highlighting the need for sustainable material sourcing strategies.

Strategic Lessons for Other Nations From This Agreement

The Power of Economic Interdependence

""The Xi-Trump rare earth deal demonstrates that even strategic competitors must balance geopolitical tensions against economic realities when critical supply chains are at stake.""

The agreement reveals how economic interdependence can create pathways for cooperation despite broader tensions. Both nations recognised that supply chain weaponisation carries mutual costs, leading to pragmatic compromise despite strategic competition. However, according to recent reports, the deal's limited scope suggests continued underlying tensions.

Building Negotiating Leverage

Nations seeking supply chain security must develop comprehensive strategies that extend beyond diplomatic engagement. Effective negotiating leverage requires:

Alternative supplier relationships reducing dependence on single sources

Domestic processing capabilities enabling strategic material control

Strategic material stockpiles providing negotiating flexibility

Technology substitution programmes reducing critical material dependence

These capabilities take years to develop, emphasising the importance of long-term strategic planning over short-term diplomatic solutions.

Understanding the Xi-Trump Rare Earth Deal: Key Questions

Will this agreement prevent future rare earth supply disruptions?

The 12-month agreement provides temporary stability but doesn't address underlying supply chain concentration risks. Long-term security requires diversified sourcing, domestic processing capacity development, and strategic material reserves.

How does this deal affect rare earth market pricing?

Short-term price stabilisation is expected through reduced uncertainty, but long-term pricing will depend on global supply chain development, alternative source availability, and continued geopolitical relations between major economies.

What happens when the agreement expires in October 2026?

Both leaders indicated potential extension possibilities, but future negotiations will depend on broader trade relationship dynamics, alternative supply development progress, and evolving geopolitical considerations across multiple issues. As industry analysts note, the expiration timeline creates ongoing uncertainty for manufacturers.

Temporary Stability in a Strategically Volatile Market

The Xi-Trump rare earth deal represents pragmatic diplomacy addressing immediate supply chain pressures rather than permanent resolution of critical mineral dependencies. While providing crucial relief for technology manufacturers and clean energy sectors, the agreement underscores urgent needs for supply chain diversification and alternative source development.

For investors and industry stakeholders, this agreement creates a valuable 12-month window to advance alternative supply projects, develop recycling capabilities, and build strategic stockpiles. The temporary nature of diplomatic solutions in critical mineral markets reinforces long-term value propositions for supply chain independence and technological innovation.

The agreement's selective scope, excluding heavy rare earth elements and processing equipment, demonstrates that fundamental supply chain vulnerabilities persist despite diplomatic headlines. Industries dependent on these materials must continue developing resilience strategies that extend beyond temporary political agreements.

This analysis involves forecasts and speculation about geopolitical developments and market conditions. Supply chain dynamics, international relations, and material pricing can change rapidly based on numerous factors beyond the scope of this temporary agreement. Readers should conduct independent research and consult qualified advisors before making investment or strategic decisions.

Research firm Redseer told Reuters that India’s recycling rates were still low compared with the United States, where they are up to five times higher, and China, where they at least 1.5 times higher.
Since 2016, brands could meet Indian recycling targets by trading Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) certificates with other companies or licensed recyclers.
The lawsuit by Daikin, LG, Samsung, Carrier, Hitachi and Havells says recycling targets are unrealistic given the limited number of licensed recyclers, especially outside major cities.
The court outcome will influence India’s electronic waste-to-minerals strategy at a time when countries are competing for these resources.","The legal action brought by the companies has been consolidated into one case and is awaiting its next hearing.

It raises questions about who will benefit from the shift; manufacturers, licensed recyclers, or the millions of informal workers who have long powered India’s electronic waste economy.

What triggered the court battle?

The new rules were issued in 2022, but authorities have only in the last year tightened implementation to make producers recycle electronic waste through government-registered recyclers at a minimum price of 22 rupees (US$0.25) per kilogram.

Companies argue this price is “arbitrary” and “anti-competitive”, and that it is roughly three to four times higher than what they previously paid.

Research firm Redseer told Reuters that India’s recycling rates were still low compared with the United States, where they are up to five times higher, and China, where they at least 1.5 times higher.

Since 2016, brands could meet Indian recycling targets by trading Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) certificates with other companies or licensed recyclers. This created a flexible market, letting them choose how and where to fulfil their obligations while keeping compliance costs lower.

Producers are now seeking a return to this system, saying the new rules remove flexibility and increase costs.

The lawsuit by Daikin, LG, Samsung, Carrier, Hitachi and Havells says recycling targets are unrealistic given the limited number of licensed recyclers, especially outside major cities.

What is the government trying to achieve?

The government says the rules are essential for building a formal, traceable recycling industry that can recover critical minerals.

The policy is part of India’s US$4-billion National Critical Minerals Mission, launched in 2023, which seeks to secure supplies through overseas deals, new domestic mines and by scaling up formal recycling.

The government says the minimum recycling price ensures recyclers are paid fairly, helping expand compliant facilities and reduce reliance on informal workshops that often lack safety standards.

India’s formal electronic waste recovery rate now exceeds 40 per cent, nearly matching that of Europe and the United States, though much of that volume still flows from informal collection networks.

More than 90 per cent of electronic waste collection and dismantling takes place in informal workshops, often by workers without protective gear, for a typical daily wage of 300 rupees (US$3.38), before the material is sold to licensed recyclers, according to estimates by Delhi-based non-profit Toxics Link.

What’s at stake for India’s clean energy and workers?

The court outcome will influence India’s electronic waste-to-minerals strategy at a time when countries are competing for these resources.

Mineral access is expected to be discussed at the UN COP30 climate summit in Brazil next month.

India could be a test case of whether emerging economies can build cleaner, fairer recycling systems. Sustainability experts caution that while the formalisation of recycling is necessary, it could exclude millions of informal workers who do much of the collection and dismantling and put them out of jobs.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/eugenia-pan-kiv-A7NNW7pjHOk-unsplash.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-11-02 10:19:03.485118

A new national survey commissioned by Sunrun shows that 80% of consumers fear the AI boom could boost their power bills—a view that is rapidly evolving into a political and regulatory hot potato for the industry. The problem is acute. Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimate U.S. data centers are on track to consume around 4% of the nation’s electricity, more than double their share in 2018, and could grow to 6.7%–12% by 2028. That projection unfolds simultaneously with the prospect of more upward pressure on wholesale market prices from fuel prices, extreme weather, and grid congestion.

Why wholesale power prices are climbing across regions

Fuel dynamics are a substantial factor. U.S. Energy Information Administration data indicate gas-fired power burn is about 20% above the 2019 level, while liquefied natural gas exports are up almost 140%, tightening the market and boosting generator costs. And thousands of heat waves are increasingly contributing to higher peak values and capacity-stress rates across multiple regions.

New supply is in short supply. The International Energy Agency notes that combined-cycle gas plants normally take about four years to build, and manufacturers are now encountering a critical shortage of one-of-a-kind turbines, with quoted deliveries extended out as far as seven years. While the interconnection queue for fresh generation and storage is still congested, it is frustrating the development of projects that might alleviate specific local price volatility.

Renewables help but policy delays and load growth loom

Renewables’ continued growth has been the price mitigator of the last decade in many markets. EIA reports that solar, wind, and grid-scale batteries will continue to lead new U.S. capacity additions in the shorter term. However, with additional long-duration tax incentives still undecided by H1 2023, this may retain barriers to accelerated growth as load outmaneuvers supply.

AI training clusters are reshaping data center demand

AI training clusters have upended the scale of data center power demands. Developers are now planning campuses on the order of 100 MW or more, with individual buildings geared for unprecedented rack densities to keep racks of GPUs and specialized accelerators humming. Utilities from Virginia to Texas report multi-gigawatt pipelines anchored by digital infrastructure customers, and grid planners in PJM, ERCOT, and the Midcontinent region have already revised load forecasts upwards.

While efficiency helps, it does not entirely mitigate the demand. The Uptime Institute reports that the average data center PUE is around 1.58, a constructive development over the last decade. However, overall consumption has continued to rise given the growth of AI workloads. Additional water and thermal management—warm-water liquid cooling and heat reuse—are eliminating waste at the margins of historical cooling; the underlying demand for compute remains.

Public sentiment may slow projects amid bill concerns

Public discernment will act as a brake. Pew Research Center reports many more Americans are concerned than positive about AI writ large. Higher electric bills—due to fuel pass-throughs, capacity costs, and native congestion—will be associated with the most-seen new fringes of power consumption: AI and hyperscale data centers.

Regulators weigh limits on large new digital loads

Policymakers are on it. State commissions are re-examining long-term utility contracts and rate designs applied to large digital loads. European experience indicates what to anticipate: Ireland’s grid manager has banned new data center connections around Dublin, and Dutch cities have put the permits on hold temporarily for mega-sites. U.S. city utilities have also indicated capacity constraints, and some require that high-load connections await transmission upgrades.

How builders are battling the rising energy cost curve

Hyperscalers are racing to secure stable energy. Power purchase agreements for long-term utility solar and wind remain the initial line of protection, trusted for cost clarity and accelerating the market. Many operations are situated next to existing nuclear plants or have signed groundbreaking contracts such as next-generation geothermal and provisional fusion to safeguard the impact and sharpen the carbon triple.

Storage is advancing from the pilot to the portfolio. Grid batteries are helping to reduce the highest prices and sustain renewable output, specifically when paired with flexible AI workloads that shift training to off-peak sessions. Liquid refrigeration, superior power delivery, and reuse of waste energy are decreasing operating costs and easing local grid pressure in compute land expenditure. However, when regional capacity is tight, none of that eliminates the exposure.

What could shape the next chapter for AI power costs

For data center operators, the choice is getting harder: secure firm power at a premium, delay projects, or redesign workloads to be more grid-interactive. For households and small businesses, the question is easier. Whatever is done, it should not involve another line item creeping charges on monthly statements. It is difficult to do it without rapid low-cost generation, storage, and transmission buildouts.

Three signals will decide the next chapter:

the pace of interconnection reforms dismantling renewable and storage backlogs;

the behavior of gas prices and LNG exports heading into peak seasons;

whether AI companies commit to aligning consumption with automated calls for flexible consumption.

If any of these trends break favorably, the AI power-price overhang will probably lessen. If not, simply wait for stricter siting rules, tougher contracts, and louder ratepayer pushback.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/featured_edited_1762020448.png,N,,2025-11-02 12:18:14.845645

As the global LNG landscape progresses toward lower-carbon solutions, how does Technip Energies plan to support the Middle East developments?

LNG remains a cornerstone of the global energy mix and it’s an opportunity for the long term. What we’re seeing today is three strong trends shaping this market: the need for secure and affordable access to energy, a steady increase in global demand, and regional policies driving lower-carbon production. And the Middle East, of course, sits right at the center of this dynamic.

At Technip Energies, we’re helping our clients respond to these trends. Our differentiation lies both in how we execute and how we innovate. Over the past decades, we’ve proven our ability to deliver mid to mega-scale projects, to leverage modular and productised solutions like SnapLNGTM by T.EN, and to advance decarbonisation through electrification and CO₂ capture.

And this know-how is tangible and recognised by the market. You can see it in action with Ruwais LNG, a landmark project with ADNOC that will be the first LNG export facility in the MENA region to run on clean power. In Oman, Marsa LNG will follow the same path, using renewable energy to produce low-carbon LNG for maritime transport.

Today, with more than 35% market share of LNG projects reaching FID since 2020, we’re proud to be shaping the next generation of LNG: modularised, electrified, and designed for lower carbon intensity.

Technip Energies has been advancing technologies in ethylene and refining decarbonisation as well as CCUS. How do you see these innovations reshaping the company’s leadership role in the energy transition over the next decade?

Indeed, beyond LNG, our leadership also extends to industrial decarbonisation, and ethylene is a great example. For more than 50 years, we’ve designed and delivered some of the world’s largest and most complex ethylene facilities. We hold roughly half of the global licensing market, which says a lot about our experience and, more importantly, the trust of our clients.

But leadership also means evolution. Over time, our clients’ priorities have changed and so have we. We’ve reworked our technologies to decarbonise ethylene production and make plants more efficient. Our low-emission cracking furnaces, proprietary equipment, and advanced simulation tools now enable up to 30% CO₂ reduction and around 20% energy efficiency improvement.

With initiatives such as BlueH₂ by T.EN and the Shell–Technip Energies CCUS alliance, how is Technip Energies positioning itself to build integrated low-carbon value chains — from hydrogen production to carbon management — on a global scale?

In fact, what we’re doing today is connecting the dots across the entire low-carbon value chain, from hydrogen production to carbon management. Our role is to bring proven solutions to our clients at every step of that journey, especially in hard-to-abate industries.

As you mentioned, we have two flagship solutions that make this possible. First, with BlueH₂ by T.EN™, we deliver scalable hydrogen solutions that can capture up to 99% of CO₂ emissions. Then there’s Canopy by T.EN™, our integrated suite of post-combustion carbon capture solutions for any type of emitter, powered by Shell’s proven CANSOLV® CO₂ Capture System.

These solutions, combined with our strong integration and execution know-how, make us a trusted partner for low-carbon projects. Because in the end, what our clients need most are proven technologies, scalable solutions, and the confidence that their projects will be delivered successfully.

This positioning has already led us to two landmarks projects: Net Zero Teesside Power in the UK, the world’s first gas-fired power station with carbon capture, and Blue Point One in the US, the world’s largest low-carbon ammonia plant.

How can an international company such as Technip Energies have a strong local content across the region?

Well, while we’re truly a global company, we’ve always believed that success is built through collaboration and proximity. Understanding our clients’ needs, being close to them, and building trust through everyday teamwork, that’s really what makes the difference.

That’s exactly the spirit behind NT Energies, our joint venture with NMDC Energy based in Abu Dhabi. It brings together strong local execution capabilities with Technip Energies’ global expertise in technology and project management. NT Energies is already delivering real value across the UAE, the wider Middle East, and North Africa, from blue and green hydrogen to CO₂ capture, waste-to-energy, biorefining, and biochemistry.

What I really like about this model is that it creates a true win-win dynamic: developing local talent, supporting regional economies, and building long-term, trust-based partnerships with our clients.","https://www.energyconnects.com/media/rzsewxpo/portrait-_-arnaud-pieton-diplômé-1998-et-ceo-de-technip-energies____-2.png?center=0.45181092694904851,0.4688180558305286&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134061099437170000",N,,2025-11-02 10:19:07.959060

The fund will also help create hydrogen hubs, connect producers with end-users, and encourage the use of made-in-Ontario hydrogen.
The updated criteria will promote projects developed by Canadian companies to help strengthen Ontario’s economy and energy security.
The expanded fund responds to industry feedback for increased government support and reaffirms Ontario’s commitment to advancing a low-carbon hydrogen economy.
“Ontario’s Hydrogen Hub in Sarnia-Lambton applauds the leadership of the Ontario government – and especially Minister Oosterhoff – as the build out of the low-carbon hydrogen economy and establishment of defined hydrogen hubs stand to benefit significantly from the support of the Hydrogen Innovation Fund,” said Matthew Slotwinski, CEO of the Sarnia-Lambton Economic Partnership.","The Ontario government is investing $30 million to launch a new round of the Hydrogen Innovation Fund, supporting projects aimed at unlocking hydrogen’s potential to drive economic growth, create good-paying jobs and strengthen the province’s position as a world leader in the clean energy economy.

This investment doubles the funding from the previous round and expands eligibility criteria under Energy for Generations, Ontario’s long-term energy roadmap designed to build a resilient, secure and self-reliant energy sector capable of powering the most competitive economy in the G7.

“By expanding the Hydrogen Innovation Fund, our government is making a strategic investment as part of our plan to protect Ontario’s economy and energy independence,” said Sam Oosterhoff, Associate Minister of Energy-Intensive Industries. “Hydrogen technologies are already unlocking new opportunities for private sector investment and creating good-paying jobs, all while enhancing our competitive edge and making Ontario a world leader in the hydrogen sector as we build a more competitive, resilient economy.”

The expanded fund includes two streams: one for projects integrating low-carbon hydrogen into Ontario’s electricity grid, and another supporting broader sector applications of hydrogen across transportation, manufacturing and heavy industry. The fund will also help create hydrogen hubs, connect producers with end-users, and encourage the use of made-in-Ontario hydrogen.

The updated criteria will promote projects developed by Canadian companies to help strengthen Ontario’s economy and energy security. The expanded fund responds to industry feedback for increased government support and reaffirms Ontario’s commitment to advancing a low-carbon hydrogen economy.

“Hydrogen has potential as both a clean energy resource and a major economic play that can create tens of thousands of jobs,” said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. “Our government’s focus is on delivering affordable energy to families, along with creating good-paying jobs as we build-up Ontario’s low-carbon future.”

Hydrogen technologies are seen as uniquely suited to fill gaps in the energy system that are difficult or costly to address through electrification alone. The province said hydrogen can help manage peak electricity demand, provide long-duration energy storage and reduce emissions in sectors such as steel, cement and refining.

“Ontario’s Hydrogen Hub in Sarnia-Lambton applauds the leadership of the Ontario government – and especially Minister Oosterhoff – as the build out of the low-carbon hydrogen economy and establishment of defined hydrogen hubs stand to benefit significantly from the support of the Hydrogen Innovation Fund,” said Matthew Slotwinski, CEO of the Sarnia-Lambton Economic Partnership. “The development of the at-scale low-carbon hydrogen economy starts with leveraging innovation to connect hydrogen producers and users, setting the stage for long-term economic growth, job creation, clean energy integration, and low-carbon diversification.”

According to a 2023 study commissioned by Natural Resources Canada, a robust hydrogen economy could create up to 70,000 jobs across Canada by 2050, including in Ontario, in areas such as production, infrastructure, storage and clean technology development, while helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Overcoming challenges with renewable energy

Wadi Zar, with a population of 7,000, is a small village accessible by sandy roads and dirt tracks that can pose challenges for vehicular travel. Here, homes made of straw and mud reflect a lifestyle grounded in simplicity, but also in struggle. For years, women like Azara relied on oil-powered lanterns that emitted harmful smoke, endangering the health of users.

""Previously, we used to use battery-powered lamps, which we only used when necessary because we couldn't afford the cost of batteries,"" shares Azara.

The project distributed solar lanterns, which have positively impacted Azara and her family.

""This solar lantern helps us provide light when cooking, helps the children study and play in the evening, and keeps us safe from snakes and scorpions. My husband and I are also able to walk safely, as we are physically disabled.""

Participants are not only learning technical skills but also provided with the knowledge to start their own businesses.

Madleen shares, ""In the production phase, we organized work teams with a unified goal: to create finished products through a complete production line. Every team member had a distinct role, contributing to the final outcome. This product not only helps ease the challenges faced by families but also provides us with the opportunity to learn a valuable new skill.""

A strategic partnership for resilience and sustainability

This project is the result of a strategic partnership between KSRelief and UNDP Yemen, a collaboration formed to address profound humanitarian and developmental challenges facing Yemen. By combining resources, expertise, and a commitment to local capacity building, KSRelief and UNDP are not only meeting critical needs but also driving sustainable change.

“In Nigeria today, we have over 10 gigawatts of stranded generation capacity.
The story is that, inside that factory, there is a 540-megawatt turbine for power generation in good condition.
And we have been wasting power-generating assets built with the funds and resources of this country,” Adelabu lamented.
They have an existing 84-megawatt power capacity that is wasting away: a thermal plant.","Despite the country’s persistent lack of electricity, over 10,000 megawatts of electricity are being wasted across different idle plants scattered across the country, Sunday PUNCH has learnt.

Nigeria’s Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, decried the country’s wastefulness in the energy sector, revealing that more than 10 gigawatts of generation capacity remain stranded nationwide while millions of citizens live in darkness.

Speaking at the just-concluded Nigeria Energy Conference in Lagos, the minister said the country’s immediate problem was not generation but the inability to transmit and distribute the energy already available.

He described the country as wasteful because plants that should light up businesses and homes were left idle without considering the cost of construction.

“In Nigeria today, we have over 10 gigawatts of stranded generation capacity. Yes, we have energy being generated or installed all over the country that we are not even using. Generation will not be our immediate problem today, but stable transmission and effective distribution to the household, with full metering.”

Energy that will power industries, create jobs, and even support electricity exports to our neighbouring countries through the regional power pool is all stranded,” he said.

The minister lamented that several government-built assets worth billions have been left idle for years, saying the country was being lazy and carefree.

Citing examples, he said the Aluminium Smelting Company in Akwa Ibom hosts six turbines of 90 megawatts each, a total of 540 megawatts, that have been lying fallow for two decades simply because of a short transmission gap.

“It’s been there for the past 20 years, not operating. There are power issues because it is not connected to the bridge. But that is not the story. The story is that, inside that factory, there is a 540-megawatt turbine for power generation in good condition. They have about six turbines of 90 megawatts each. Each of these turbines has a capacity for an additional 20 megawatts, which is 120 megawatts, plus 540. It is a potential 660 megawatts of power that has been there for the past 20 years.

“And we are not even bothered, just because there are fewer than four kilometres of line to be connected to the 330-132 kV substation. Can you see how wasteful we are in this country? Beside it is the Ibom power station, less than two kilometres away, with a regular gas supply. And we have been wasting power-generating assets built with the funds and resources of this country,” Adelabu lamented.

From there, the minister said he proceeded to the Port Harcourt Refinery, where another 84-megawatt power facility has been wasting away.

“From there, I drove straight to the NNPC’s Port Harcourt Refinery Company. They have an existing 84-megawatt power capacity that is wasting away: a thermal plant. Built for NNPC, though NNPC is not consuming up to 20 megawatts. We have 60 megawatts of power stranded in that location inside Port Harcourt, and Port Harcourt Disco is complaining of a lack of supply of energy from the grid. Meanwhile, there is a wasted asset. And by extension, it is not just 84 megawatts that is wasted; they have an additional potential of 120 megawatts to be constructed using the same facility, that is 200 megawatts. So who says this country is not rich? Who says we don’t have potential? But are we realising these potentials? We are just being complacent, lazy and carefree. And that is how it is littered all over the country. I just gave you two examples,” Adelabu said.

The minister added his team would be visiting more stranded power locations across the country “to show the world that Nigeria has the resources to be a leader in the power sector.”

“With this new Electricity Act of 2023, states can now generate, transmit, and distribute power. They are like sovereigns. So the subnationals must take the bull by the horn and light up their states,” he advised.

He assured investors that government policies now favour private capital and long-term investment in the power sector.

“Our market fundamentals are improving, and our policy environment is clear. The national leadership is committed to creating the enabling conditions for innovation and investment. As minister, I am personally involved in generation, transmission, and distribution. I know where the shoe pinches, and I know the steps we must take,” Adelabu said.

Urging participants at the conference to act decisively, he added, “Let’s think boldly, collaborate strategically, and invest with purpose. Together, through sustained investment and forward-thinking innovation, we can light up Nigeria and build an energy-secure future.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/19091912/Adebayo-Adelabu.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 07:59:03.910340

(AP) — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn’t easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota’s legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,” he said, “and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.”",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/11/6906250e182ec8.68329809.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-02 10:19:13.940034

In a letter sent Wednesday to the Justice Department, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and Securities and Exchange Commission, Bird said some refineries may be ""gaming the system"" to receive small refinery exemptions while simultaneously reporting strong profits to investors.

The RFS requires refiners to blend renewable fuels such as ethanol into their products or buy compliance credits. Bird said some companies appear to have manipulated production to remain under the 75,000-barrel-per-day cap that qualifies them for exemptions, and have made public filings touting record profits and stock buybacks — claims she said are inconsistent with assertions of financial hardship.

""Renewable fuels are part of the backbone of Iowa's economy,"" Bird said in a statement. ""The possibility that refineries are gaming the system to receive government handouts when they don't need them hurts Iowa farmers.""

Bird, in the letter, said the RFS program ""plays a critical role in setting the demand for renewable liquid fuels and the agricultural feedstocks necessary for such fuels — both of which are critical to the economic prosperity of Iowa and surrounding States.""

Attorneys general from Nebraska and South Dakota joined Bird in signing the letter, which calls on federal officials to ""restore integrity"" to the renewable fuels program.

The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association applauded Bird.

""In a time when crop prices are low and increased biofuels usage is a key solution, it is deeply troubling to see what appears to be an attempt by some oil refiners to game the system and avoid their legal requirements under the RFS,"" Executive Director Monte Shaw said in a statement.

Iowa Biodiesel Board warns of losses, urges quick EPA action

Meanwhile, the Iowa Biodiesel Board submitted formal comments to the EPA urging the agency to swiftly finalize the 2026-2027 Renewable Fuel Standard rule and to fully reallocate nearly 200 small refinery exemptions. The group warned that failure to act could cost U.S. soybean farmers $3.2 billion to $7.5 billion in crop value over the next two years, citing data from the World Agricultural and Economic Environmental Services model.

""U.S. biomass-based diesel adds value to every acre of soybeans grown, accounting for roughly ten percent of each bushel's worth — a contribution that is especially vital this year as America's soybean farmers face record yields amid unpredictable global markets,"" Iowa Biodiesel Board Executive Director Grant Kimberley said in a statement.

The board said independent biodiesel producers in Iowa, lacking the financial reserves of larger competitors, are particularly vulnerable to prolonged regulatory uncertainty.

The board is calling on the EPA to:

Reallocate 100% of small refinery exemptions for 2023 through 2027Finalize Renewable Volume Obligations before the new compliance year beginsMaintain strong volume targets to ensure market certainty for farmers and producers.

Kimberley said the industry appreciates the EPA's recognition of expanded production capacity but stressed that timely rulemaking is critical as Iowa farmers already are making planting decisions for the next season.

Iowa's biodiesel industry supports 12,000 jobs and generates roughly $3.5 billion in economic activity. In 2024, the state's 10 biodiesel plants produced an estimated 350 million gallons, making Iowa the nation's top biodiesel-producing state.

Feenstra backs strong biofuel volumes and reallocation

Also, Iowa U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Hull, led a bipartisan letter — signed by 49 members of Congress — to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin expressing strong support for the agency's proposed Renewable Volume Obligations under the RFS. The lawmakers urged the EPA to reallocate 100% of waived gallons from any granted small refinery exemptions and to finalize the rule as quickly as possible.

""A final, timely … rule that includes strong RVOs and necessary reallocation represents the most meaningful commitment to farmers and rural communities, homegrown American energy, and affordability for consumers,"" Feenstra said in a statement.

Feenstra, who earlier this week formally announced he is running for Iowa governor in 2026, was joined in the effort by the rest of Iowa's all-Republican congressional delegation.

In September, the EPA issued a supplemental proposal considering proposed levels of reallocation for small refinery exemptions — a key issue for Midwestern lawmakers and biofuel producers seeking market stability and fairness in implementation of the RFS.

Medicare changes ahead as open enrollment begins

With the Medicare open enrollment period underway through Dec. 7, thousands of Iowans are reviewing their options amid significant changes.

According to the Iowa Insurance Division's Senior Health Insurance Information Program, major adjustments in plan offerings, drug coverage and provider networks are expected in 2026 after new federal drug pricing reforms and the 2025 cap on prescription co-payments.

The federal health insurance program provides coverage for people 65 or older, as well as younger people with certain disabilities or health conditions.

Among the biggest changes this year:

Plan cancellations: UnitedHealthcare is canceling eight of its 10 AARP Medicare Advantage plans in Iowa, affecting about 36,500 enrollees. Wellmark is ending three of four plans with drug coverage. Beneficiaries in canceled plans must select a new plan by Jan. 1 to avoid losing coverage.Reduced service areas: 22 other Medicare Advantage plans have shrunk their geographic coverage, meaning some Iowans' plans may no longer be available in their county.Provider network changes: Several large health systems have adjusted which Medicare Advantage plans they accept, making it critical for members to confirm their providers remain in-network.Lower drug costs: Negotiated price reductions are taking effect for 10 high-cost drugs — Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara and Novolog/Fiasp — though costs will vary by plan.

Kristin Griffith, SHIIP and Senior Medicare Patrol director, urged Iowans to act quickly if their plan is ending or no longer offered in their area. Beneficiaries in those situations have guaranteed issue rights, allowing them to switch to another Medicare Advantage plan or return to Original Medicare and buy a Medicare supplement without medical underwriting or higher premiums — but only until Feb. 28.

""It is time individuals on Medicare to read all mail from their plan or provider and stay informed of possible changes,"" the Iowa Insurance Division said in a news release.

If a Medicare beneficiary receives notice that their plan has been canceled or is no longer offered in their ZIP code, ""that letter is the proof required to secure the guaranteed issue right to enroll in a Medicare Supplement,"" according to the Insurance Division.

Last year, SHIIP-SMP helped more than 52,000 Iowans and saved clients tens of millions of dollars, according to the Insurance Division.

The deal, finalized on October 13, 2025, provides a substantial boost to the continent's ambitions of establishing a self-sufficient lithium supply chain, moving away from its current import dependency.

The multi-year contract with Glencore represents a significant commercial achievement for Vulcan Energy. Under the terms of the agreement, the company will supply between 36,000 and 44,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate from its Lionheart Project over an eight-year period. This partnership elevates the Swiss resource giant to the status of Vulcan Energy's fourth major industrial customer, joining existing partners Stellantis, LG Energy Solution, and Umicore.

Beyond the immediate revenue stream, this collaboration provides Vulcan Energy with crucial long-term visibility necessary for securing project financing. The commitment from a global industry leader like Glencore serves as a powerful endorsement of the company's innovative approach to lithium extraction. The Lionheart Project is designed for an annual production capacity of 24,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide—sufficient to power approximately half a million electric vehicles each year.

Accelerating Commercial Development

Vulcan Energy is rapidly advancing its transition from development to full-scale production. The company has demonstrated this progress through a series of strategic capital commitments, including awarding a €140 million contract to JordProxa for plant engineering. Concurrently, agreements have been finalized with Turboden and ROM Technik for the construction of geothermal power plants.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Vulcan Energy?

These investments support the company's groundbreaking methodology, which centers on its Direct Lithium Extraction technology. This process utilizes geothermal energy derived from thermal brine, operating without freshwater consumption and achieving a zero-carbon emission footprint.

Addressing Europe's Critical Supply Gap

The strategic importance of Vulcan Energy's project is underscored by Europe's current lithium supply dynamics. The continent presently imports between 97% and 99% of its lithium requirements, creating a strategic vulnerability amid growing geopolitical tensions. Domestic production from sources like Vulcan Energy could fundamentally alter this landscape.

European battery gigafactories are projected to reach a combined capacity exceeding 700 GWh by 2030, creating annual demand for 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide. Vulcan Energy's local production offers substantial logistical advantages, eliminating transport costs exceeding $1,000 per tonne typically associated with shipments from South America while simultaneously enhancing supply chain reliability and flexibility.

With a planned funding round scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2025, Vulcan Energy is positioning itself to establish the foundation for commercial production commencing in 2028.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2372986_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 11:19:03.923272

While nuclear proponents like Friedman dismiss opposition to nuclear power as an artifact of the Cold War and media misinformation, there were reasons for those fears.","Swords or ploughshares?

That’s the dilemma that has plagued us since the sudden dawn of the nuclear age. Should we split atoms for peace or to rain destruction on our enemies? In the space of a single human life we’ve done both, killing hundreds of thousands in two atomic bomb attacks on Japan and then building nuclear reactors to provide light, power and medicine.

Radioactivity was discovered just more than a century ago, when Wilhelm Roentgen detected X-rays. In high school textbooks, most of us saw the ghostly radiograph of his wife Anna’s skeletal hand with wedding band, “Hand mit Ringen.” The image — the first X-ray — prompted Anna to remark, “I have seen my own death.” In 1913, science fiction writer H.G. Wells predicted both nuclear power and weaponry, in “The World Set Free.” In 1938, the trio of Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann were first to recognize that uranium atoms split when bombarded by neutrons. When physicist Leo Szilard confirmed fission, according to author Edward A. Friedman, he said ”the world was headed for sorrow.”

In 1939, Szilard and Albert Einstein sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt advising that fission could be used to create a powerful new bomb. The scientists feared the Nazis were already working on such a device, and their letter helped spur creation of the secret Manhattan Project, which eventually resulted to the test firing of the first atomic bomb in a remote part of New Mexico in 1945. Three weeks later came the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.

The Cold War began shortly after, and by 1949 our former allies, the Soviets, had their own nuclear weapon, too.

Later we created nuclear weapons stockpiles ready to kill hundreds of millions more and built dozens of nuclear generating plants to provide about 20% of the American electrical supply. One of those plants, Wolf Creek, owned by two regional utilities, has been online in Kansas since 1985.

Now comes a firm founded by one of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates, with the lure of bringing “advanced” nuclear power to Kansas. TerraPower announced a partnership last month with the state’s Department of Commerce and Evergy, one of the owners of Wolf Creek, to explore placing a natrium reactor somewhere in the utility’s service area of eastern Kansas.

TerraPower is already building a $4 billion pilot natrium reactor site in Wyoming, with half of the funding from the US Department of Energy. Some of the projected energy may power AI data centers. The company promises clean and safe power through its innovative technology, which uses molten salt (natrium is Latin for sodium) to cool the 345-megawatt reactor instead of water, as is done at Wolf Creek and every other commercial nuclear plant in the U.S.

A few Kansas communities in Evergy country have already tossed their hardhats in the ring to host the natrium reactor, including my home city of Emporia. The city commission, along with the county board and a regional development association, signed a letter of support for the project. Commissioners in Coffey County, home to the Wolf Creek plant, have also expressed interest, as have officials in Hutchinson.

TerraPower claims it will only place reactors where they are wanted, but there’s not been time for any substantive public discussion yet on the issue. Nobody asked Kansans whether we want a second nuclear plant or not. Another firm, Deep Fission, is working with an undisclosed partner to place reactors at the bottom of mile-deep holes in Kansas to supply power-hungry AI centers, but it’s not answering questions about details or whether it has sought state approval.

The gold rush for new nuclear is on.

We are, according to current U.S. policy, on the verge of a “new nuclear renaissance.” Old fears spawned by Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl are receding in popular memory. There is now public and bipartisan support for expanding nuclear power, according to a Pew Research Center poll.

It is understandable why leaders in a community like Emporia — which logged the state’s highest unemployment following the closure of Tyson meats — would find TerraPower’s projected 1,500 construction and 500 permanent jobs attractive.

But those vying to bring TerraPower jobs to their communities might want to cool their enthusiasm long enough to consider the safety and security risks presented by natrium reactors.

These risks were described to me by Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy group. Lyman is an expert on nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and safety and security. He’s also one of the authors of “Fukishima: The Story of a Nuclear Disaster.”

“I have signifcant concerns,” Lyman said, “related to safety and security as well as for the economics. … It’s inexplicable to me why there’s so much enthusiasm for this type of reactor.”

When I spoke with Lyman on Tuesday, he’d just finished monitoring a multi-day Nuclear Regulatory Commission advisory committee meeting reviewing the preliminary safeguard assessment of the TerraPower’s Wyoming reactor.

It is important to note that TerraPower refused my repeated requests for an interview. “TerraPower will have to politely decline participation in this opportunity at this time,” public relations specialist Brooke Leader said on behalf of the firm.

The problems with the natrium reactor, Lyman said, are inherent in the design of any sodium-cooled reactor. The molten sodium bursts into flame upon contact with air or water, he said, and these types of reactors have historically been expensive to build and prone to leaks. But, he said, the most worrying thing about the natrium reactor is that it uses fuel enriched to up to 20% of the isotope Uranium 235. This fuel is called HALEU, for high assay low enrichment uranium, and it’s just below the threshold for weapons-grade material.

Conventional nuclear reactors use fuel that is between 3 and 5% enriched.

Natrium reactors require HALEU to make them smaller and more efficient, Lyman said, but there is no domestic source of this fuel available in the quantities needed. In addition, security at natrium reactors would have to be beefed up compared with conventional reactors, because HALEU is attractive to terrorists and rogue states. Enriching uranium to 20% represents most of the effort required to make weapons-grade material.

In addition, there’s the problem — inherent with every reactor currently operating or planned in the United States — that there’s no long-term storage solution for spent fuel. Work on the Yucca Mountain geologic repository was halted in 2010. All waste is stored on-site, in cooling ponds and dry casks. It will remain hazardous for much longer than there has been recorded history — tens of thousands of years.

We can’t even keep the government running year-round or provide reliable food and health care to our poorest Americans. How can we expect to keep the distant future safe from us?

The immediate risk with a natrium reactor, Lyman said, is fire.

Molten sodium “is a highly reactive material, so you have to keep it away from the air and water at all costs,” Lyman said, “or you could end up with a sodium fire. And having a nuclear reactor where the coolant itself can catch on fire just sounds like a bad idea. It really is. So they have to go to extraordinary lengths to prevent any exposure of the coolant to air or water.”

This adds a level of unneeded complexity, he said. Even though TerraPower claims that natrium reactors are safer than light water-cooled reactors, Lyman said just the opposite is true. The time to respond to accidents is much shorter, he said, and there is no containment structure — the familiar dome-shaped vessel — as additional backup to contain leaks.

“The Department of Energy is trying, with Congress’s help, to stimulate and stand up a whole production program for this kind of (HALEU) material,” Lyman said. “But the demand is very unclear. The investments are on the order of billions and billions of dollars for an infrastructure to make this fuel. It’s a risky proposition, and it’s not clear that TerraPower is going to have the amount of fuel it needs just for the first plant.”

Because TerraPower would not speak to me, I will rely on author Edward A. Friedman, in his 2025 book “Nuclear Energy: boom, Bust, and Emerging Renaissance,” to make the case for next generation reactor technology.

“The promise for successful realization of (advanced) technology was significantly enhanced with the groundbreaking of the TerraPower sodium-cooled natrium reactor,” Friedman writes. Bills Gates’s company, TerraPower, began construction June 10, 2024, at Kemmerer, Wyoming, “of the natrium fast-neutron, liquid sodium-cooled reactor (SFR) that uses an associated liquid salt storage system. This fail-safe, small modular reactor (SMR) will be the first model in the world for cost-effective replacement of a coal-fired power plant with a nuclear reactor.”

The reactor is expected to become operational in 2030.

Gates hopes for hundreds of coal-to-nuclear transformations in the future, according to Friedman. Indeed, the vision of replacing fossil fuel that drove Gates to found TerraPower in the first place.

“There’s no scenario in which we keep adding carbon to the atmosphere and the world stops getting hotter,” Gates wrote in his 2021 book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.”

“The hotter it gets, the harder it will be for humans to survive, much less thrive,” Gates wrote.

Nuclear is the only carbon-free energy source, he said, that can reliably deliver power day and night through any type of weather on a large scale. It’s also one of the few practical ways to bring electricity to the poorest of countries, such as those found in sub-Saharan Africa. Access to energy is highly correlated to wealth and happiness.

“It’s no secret that nuclear power has its problems,” Gates wrote. “It’s very expensive to build today. Human error can cause accidents. Uranium, the fuel it uses, can be converted for use in weapons. The waste is dangerous and hard to store.”

Yet, nuclear represented our best hope of stopping global warming, he claimed. There was nothing more important than halting the rise in temperature if we were to avoid catastrophe.

Recently, Gates has changed his tune on climate.

In a memo to COP30, the United Nations climate change conference scheduled for next week in Brazil, Gates abandoned his previous “net zero” views. He criticized “doomsday” climate scenarios and suggested that people will be able to “live and thrive” in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future. It’s time to put “human welfare” at the center of climate strategies and improving agriculture and health in the poorest countries.

“Climate change is a serious problem,” he said, “but it will not be the end of civilization.”

The memo sounds like nothing short of a retreat from climate activism from a man who had spent personal billions on a quest for net zero. In the case of his push for advanced reactors, Gates may have been so driven by his desire to stop global warming that he swallowed the nuclear pill.

His sudden redirection must be having some effect on TerraPower, the company he founded. But his memo will have no effect on the U.S. delegation to COP30, because there will be no official American presence there. Donald Trump had already pulled the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. The world has now blown past the agreement’s 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global warming, with more climate suffering to follow.

Trump recently directed the United States to resume nuclear weapons testing, something we haven’t done since 1992. There is not yet a name for this arms race, but it is on as surely as the seas are rising. I am reminded of Damocles from Greek mythology, who was taught the dangers of power by the sword dangling above. So let us call this the Age of Damocles, because nothing is happy for those wracked by anxiety.

It is no coincidence that we embrace a new arms race at the same moment we accelerate the regulatory process to approve and deploy new types of nuclear reactors that use disturbingly enriched fuel. While nuclear proponents like Friedman dismiss opposition to nuclear power as an artifact of the Cold War and media misinformation, there were reasons for those fears. Troubling issues remain.

Opposition to nuclear power that curbed the U.S. nuclear power program from the 1980s until recently was based not only on fictional movies like 1979’s “The China Syndrome” but in real-life accidents like Fukishima in 2011, in which an earthquake and tsunami shut down the power grid and made it impossible to cool the reactors. More recently, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, has caused alarm because it’s been damaged and sometimes cut off in the ongoing war with Russia. Movies that might contain some inaccuracies, such as the 2019 HBO miniseries “Chernobyl,” are not causes of our nuclear jitters but expressions of them.

This is the global context in which we find ourselves pondering whether a new type of nuclear energy is good for Kansas or just a costly experiment that will risk accident or murderous mayhem. We live in a new period of global instability, one driven by all the old forces — greed, ignorance, haste, denial — that have plagued us since the ice receded. The communications from TerraPower have been carefully curated to present a sanitized version of a techno billionaire philanthropist’s dream of a nuclear renaissance.

I’m cold to the idea of spending billions on nuke plants to power, in large part, electricity-hungry AI data centers. It seems immoral when so many Americans go hungry and are without health insurance. Beyond that, there’s just too many unanswered questions about next-generation reactors.

But I’m opposed to the TerraPower plan for a natrium reactor in Kansas not because of the unknowns — where, how much, how long? — but because of what we do know. The HALEU fuel, in the amounts needed, presents an unacceptable risk of nuclear proliferation.

Read our updated Tesla's Growth Dilemma analysis...","Tesla has finally delivered what investors have been anxiously awaiting: a return to revenue growth. However, this achievement comes with significant consequences that are brutally evident in the company's compressed profit margins. As vehicle deliveries climb following three consecutive quarters of decline, profitability is deteriorating rapidly. Market observers are now questioning whether Tesla is essentially purchasing its growth through aggressive discounting strategies.

Profitability Under Severe Pressure

The electric vehicle manufacturer's financial health shows a troubling divergence between top-line performance and bottom-line results. While revenues are expanding, earnings are contracting dramatically. Tesla's net income plummeted by approximately $1 billion, with earnings per share collapsing by 37 percent. The operating margin witnessed an alarming contraction, falling from 10.8 percent to just 5.8 percent.

Several key factors contributed to this margin erosion:

* Intensifying competitive pressures are forcing continuous price reductions

* Rising administrative expenses are creating additional margin pressure

* Tariff-related costs totaling $400 million negatively impacted financial performance

The market response was immediate and telling. Following the earnings release, Tesla shares initially dropped by five percent before staging a partial recovery.

Revenue Resurgence with Hidden Costs

Breaking a three-quarter streak of disappointing results, Tesla reported encouraging revenue growth. The company posted an 11.6 percent year-over-year increase, with total revenue reaching $28.09 billion, exceeding Wall Street's projections. This sudden reversal was primarily fueled by a buying surge in the United States, where customers rushed to take advantage of expiring government incentives for electric vehicles.

Diverging Business Segments

Tesla's current story reveals two distinctly different operational realities. While the core automotive business struggles with severe margin compression, another division is experiencing remarkable success. The energy storage segment reported revenue growth of nearly 50 percent, continuing its impressive performance trajectory. Demand for Tesla's battery technology is booming, with this business unit operating at peak efficiency.

During the earnings presentation, CEO Elon Musk redirected attention toward future initiatives, particularly highlighting the humanoid ""Optimus"" robot and other long-term visions. This forward-looking focus has left some investors concerned about present-day challenges. With government tax credits phasing out and the core automotive business facing headwinds, stakeholders are questioning when management will address the company's immediate strategic needs.

Now, with Scotland set to supply the three quarters of Britain’s onshore wind power, some fear history could repeat itself.","In other words, if the wind is blowing strongly across all turbines, Scotland could generate enough electricity to supply over 70% of Britain’s total onshore wind power needs.

There are now calls to ban further onshore wind farms fearing it is being used to power the UK's green revolution while seeing little reward.

Some critics warn that Scotland’s rapid expansion of wind power for export could be a repeat of the oil experience, when billions of pounds of North Sea oil wealth largely flowed south instead of benefiting local communities.

Government data suggests that the nation produced about a third of the UK's onshore wind power needs last year.

To manage that power surge, Scotland's energy storage capacity is to be ramped up and would become the highest of any of the ten regions of the UK - with 7.5GW out of 27GW across Britain by 2030. According to Renewable UK, the UK has more than 6.8GW of storage with 16% (1.09GW) in Scotland.

The huge batteries are needed because wind power is not constant and they store excess energy when the wind blows, and release it back into the grid when it does not.

But NESO has also indicated more action was needed to expand green power.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Scotland produced a huge share of Britain’s oil, yet much of the economic gain went to companies and the UK Treasury rather than staying in the country.

The loss of control over this “black gold” sparked widespread frustration and became a rallying point for Scottish nationalism. Alba leader and fair energy prices campaigner Kenny MacAskill has accused the UK Government of exploiting Scotland’s natural resources and called for a ban on further onshore wind farms.

""This confirms why Scotland is so vital to the UK economy. It is Scottish renewable energy which is to fuel power and heat it,"" he said.

""It is clear that Scotland is just a resource to be exploited. Our energy taken, no revenues given and few jobs and businesses provided, all whilst our environment is trashed.

""Basically we're supplying the south. The time has come for a moratorium on further onshore wind, other than small scale community owned ones. Enough is enough.""

It comes as a frightening energy debt mountain is gripping the nation, with total unpaid bills set to hit £4.43 billion by the end of June — nearly triple the 2019 figure of £1.55 billion.

The most vulnerable Scots alone are estimated to owe over £400 million, which has prompted calls for government action.

Analysis from regulator Ofgem shows debt has surged by almost £1 billion in the past year alone, leaving households reeling amid the ongoing cost-of-living crisis.

Under the energy bills price cap set by regulator Ofgem, which limits how much suppliers can charge households per unit of gas and electricity, the average annual bill is £1,755. Despite the cap, this is still over 50% higher than four years ago.

Frazer Scott, chief executive of Energy Action Scotland said: ""Energy is an essential requirement and consumers are most concerned about affordability and security of supply to their homes and business.

""It isn’t working in the favour of consumers, mounting debt, more time off supply for those on prepayment meters and 1 in 3 in fuel poverty. It is time to think differently, to at least have an honest debate about the future and how we can reconcile targets for fuel poverty and net zero.""

Meanwhile, the Herald revealed that households have been landed with a £6.6 billion bill to pay energy firms — mostly Scottish wind farms — for switching off because the grid cannot handle all the green power being generated.

The amount of so-called constraint payments reached £1.7 billion in 2024/25, more than four times higher than five years ago, with £1.2 billion (70%) going to Scottish turbines.

NESO has set out the road map for wind power in Scotland in an analysis of the UK Government’s Clean Power 2030 plan which sets targets for how much clean energy should be built across Britain by 2030. And the grid operator has broken down what Scotland, needs to deliver to hit these national goals.

In Scotland, this means a big increase in renewable energy projects, especially battery storage and land-based turbine sites, along with some new solar developments. But they say hitting those goals will require careful planning, stronger electricity networks, investment in local supply chains, and support from communities that will host the projects.

The analysis sees Scotland as a ""significant resource for renewables, but its large pipeline of energy projects are limited in part due to the unique geography and rural grid"". It stated: ""Scotland needs greater investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure to support the development of renewables which can facilitate decarbonisation and new industrial activity. ""It also requires strategic planning of generation, storage and demand...""

It added: ""We are committed to engaging closely and collaboratively with customers and stakeholders across Scotland to understand its unique and varied context.""

It states that their regional energy planning team in Scotland was working with the Scottish Government , local authorities and industry to help ensure Scotland ""responds to local and national ambitions"".

The perception that Scotland was being exploited for its resources helped fuel the rise of the Scottish National Party, which campaigned for greater autonomy and eventually independence.

Now, with Scotland set to supply the three quarters of Britain’s onshore wind power, some fear history could repeat itself.

They argue that the country could again become a supplier of energy wealth with limited local benefit, while households and industries south of the border reap the rewards of Scotland’s turbines.

Mr MacAskill, the former SNP justice secretary added: ""We're to be England's giant onshore wind farm but getting nothing in return. The pylons running from the north down the east coast and through the central borders are simply to power England.

""This all confirms that Scotland has received a second great energy bounty. First it was oil and gas and now its renewables. The wealth of Norway has passed us by but the benefit of North Sea oil must still be pursued and used for Scotland's benefit.

""But equally the old adage of fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me applies. We must ensure that the wind resource isn't taken from us for a song with our land and people losing out. Lessons must be learned. It cannot be allowed that Scotland is energy rich, yet Scots are fuel poor.

""It's why there should be no more onshore [wind farms] at the moment. Its simply a bonanza for developers with the price paid by consumers and the Scottish environment.""

It comes just three months after a “once in a generation” movement of 53 community councils called for a summit with UK and Scottish energy ministers to pause new energy projects in Scotland’s most scenic areas.

They say they are being overwhelmed by a “barrage” of over 700 renewable energy applications in the Highlands alone, including wind, hydro, storage, and transmission projects, many backed by well-funded overseas developers.

The councils want an inquiry into the cumulative impact on communities and landscapes, warning that unchecked development could override local democracy and accelerate depopulation.

Highland Conservative councillor Helen Crawford, who was a key convention organiser, is now planning to stand in the 2026 Scottish Parliamentary Elections in the deputy first minister Kate Forbes; seat of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch because she felt ""so strongly about the pylon disaster"" and it might provided a ""decent shot at getting the pause"".

The UK Government said that energy firms were pouring billions into Scotland’s green infrastructure, with SSEN Transmission planning up to £31.7bn in upgrades by 2031 and Scottish Power investing £12bn in new transmission networks, supporting thousands of jobs.

Major offshore projects like Cerulean Winds’ £10.9bn Aspen scheme, Berwick Bank, and Green Volt were set to create thousands more roles while the Acorn project in Aberdeen was expected to generate around 15,000 jobs.

A UK Department of for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said: 'Our mission to make the UK a clean energy superpower will unlock economic opportunity for Scotland.

“Our landmark Clean Energy Jobs Plan will deliver up to 40,000 new jobs in Scotland by 2030, creating the next generation of skilled roles.

""Clean energy will bring growth and investment.

When done right, it becomes a major driver for long-term value in the energy sector and across industries.","The sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow.

This simple reality has long posed challenges for energy companies trying to integrate renewable power into their grids.

Now AI is emerging as a potential solution to manage the intermittent nature of wind and solar generation.

Ashiss Kumar Dash, EVP and Global Head Services, Utilities, Resources, Energy and Enterprise Sustainability at Infosys, says AI can help generate more reliable renewable energy output through better weather forecasting and grid management.

But he also stresses that the technology must be deployed responsibly.

Infosys has already worked on more than 60 AI projects in the energy sector, including a deployment for a major North American utility that improved load forecasting accuracy to 95% and saved tens of millions of dollars in infrastructure investment.

How can AI impact the energy sector?

AI offers incredible possibilities to modernise and improve the energy sector. The energy sector is asset heavy. AI makes these assets intelligent and self-learning. Whether it’s optimising operations, enabling data-informed decisions or predicting equipment failures before they happen, AI offers significant promise in helping energy companies run smarter and more efficiently. AI will open doors for renewables as well, allowing companies to forecast weather patterns better and generate more reliable wind and solar output.

On the side of operations, it powers predictive maintenance and reduces downtime for heavy infrastructure. One of the challenges in the rapidly changing energy sector is grid modelling and design; AI is tremendously helpful in this complex area.

We’re also seeing Gen AI come into play, responding to design questions, ensuring safety in the field, automating reports, answering customer inquiries through virtual agents and even helping engineers simulate new designs through digital twin technologies. AI enables energy companies to balance sustainability with performance, while staying ahead in a transforming regulatory and market environment.

What goes into an AI strategy?

I believe there should not be a separate “AI strategy”. AI should be the business strategy in this sector. A strong AI strategy is really about building a scalable, sustainable foundation that works across the entire organisation. At Infosys, we approach this through five key pillars:

Tech Incubation – Trying out new tools and ideas to solve real-world energy problems.

Building the Platform and Ecosystem – Making sure the data, infrastructure and integrations are solid.

Responsible AI – Setting guardrails for fairness, transparency and compliance from the start.

Focusing on the Right Use Cases – Prioritising projects that offer clear value and ROI. This could mean reducing downtime, streamlining supply chains or cutting costs through automation.

Reusable Solutions Across Teams – Creating templates and models that can be adapted across all functions – engineering, finance, HR, legal and beyond.

Beyond these pillars, successful AI deployment comes from how well the strategy is executed and embedded into day-to-day operations. That’s why we establish dedicated “strategy and execution pods” to bring together the right mix of tech, domain and business expertise. These teams don’t just plan; they also build, test and scale solutions quickly.

And because AI is constantly evolving, we treat the strategy as a living framework—one that can adapt to new regulations, technologies and market shifts. The goal is to ensure AI delivers real, measurable impact while staying aligned with both the company’s values and its long-term vision.

How has Infosys used AI to support the energy sector?

One great example is our work with a major utility company in North America where we deployed AI models to perform on-demand, bottom-up, long-term grid forecasting and enable smart decision making on capital spend and unplanned outages. The first-of-its-kind solution used open-source ML models, a CIM utility model and scalable cloud architecture to provide significant business benefits to the client:

Improving load forecasting accuracy to 95%.

Savings of tens of millions (USD) in electrical infrastructure investment by transitioning out from “annual peak load” and reduced unplanned outage to <1% from previous >5-10%. This was primarily because of efficient and proactive grid investments or upgrade in precise grid areas of electrical infrastructure.

Forecast “At Will” - anytime, anywhere – for any forecast horizon (10 years for DSP, 15 years scenario study, 22 years for 2045 study).

Faster processing within twenty-four hours for 650K transformers compared to 85 hours for 6,500 assets (i.e. 25 times faster while using 100 times more nodes.)

High agility - more agile response to emerging regulatory needs.

Similarly, we have more than 60 AI projects driving remarkable transformation across the energy sector.

What can businesses do to ensure ethical and compliant AI deployment?

Responsible AI is absolutely essential in an age where technological advancement has grown in intelligence, use and popularity like never before. Companies need to make sure their AI systems are fair, transparent and compliant with industry standards, values and regulations.

To get it right, businesses need to put strong governance in place to oversee how AI is built and used, making sure it aligns with governing regulations, guardrails and ethical standards. It’s important to embed responsible practices from the start, thinking about fairness, transparency and bias before any model goes live.

Regular monitoring helps catch performance drifts or unintended outcomes and involving cross-functional teams, like legal, HR and compliance, ensures diverse perspectives are part of the process. Just as important is educating employees on how AI works and the risks involved, so they feel empowered to use it responsibly.

Infosys views responsible AI as a way to build trust while advancing innovation, performance and efficiency.

But both paths are proving difficult. Without representation, they remain outside key policy discussions, financing frameworks, and subsidy programs that could shape their future.

Startups like Montra Electric, AutoNxt, and ShreeMarut have been developing electric tractors aimed at reducing emissions and fuel costs in agriculture. Yet, as they look to expand production, the absence of a collective industry voice has become a serious handicap.

The lack of association backing also makes financing difficult. Without an institutional framework or recognized body to interface with lenders, startups say banks are hesitant to finance electric tractor purchases.

""Not a single bank has said they will finance an e-tractor,"" said one founder on a condition of anonymity. ""They finance every other electric vehicle, but not tractors yet.""

Experts say that from the perspective of lenders and policymakers, the segment remains too small and untested. ""Financing institutions rely on data and scale,"" said an industry expert. ""A formal association could help generate that data and bridge trust between startups and regulators.""

""Joining the Tractor Manufacturers’ Association (TMA) is essential,"" said one founder. ""Without it, startups have no access to policy discussions or financing networks. But the entry conditions make it nearly impossible.""

The TMA, which represents India’s major tractor manufacturers such as Escorts Kubota, Sonalika, and John Deere, requires companies to have at least ten years of operational history, a source revealed. Most electric tractor firms are only a few years old.

""A startup will die for sure, if not today, then tomorrow,"" said an industry source. ""The TMA’s rule is that a company must be ten years old. The government’s rule is that there should be at least seven companies to form an association.""

TMA did not respond to Autocar Professional’s queries at the time of publishing.

The government allows new industry associations to be formed if at least seven registered members apply together — a requirement that, in a young sector with only a handful of active players, is proving hard to meet.

""Are startups capable of organizing that many events and initiatives? Forming and promoting an association needs money too,"" said another founder.

Industry insiders say the lack of formal representation is one reason electric tractors remain outside subsidy programs. The PM-eDrive scheme, a revised version of FAME, currently supports electric two-wheelers, buses, and ambulances, but not tractors.

""Policy inclusion usually follows when there’s an organized body pushing for it,"" said a source familiar with the matter. ""Right now, e-tractor startups don’t have that collective lobbying power.""

For now, the electric tractor industry remains fragmented with a few innovators trying to establish themselves while struggling for a collective identity.

""The technology is ready, but the ecosystem isn’t,"" said a founder.

A two-headed wind turbine that is nothing like the wind turbines we have seen traditionally. It is a striking sight, but more impressive than that is the 10 megawatts of power it can generate. The two turbines catch the wind above the waves, which has made this turbine yield a high efficiency.

How a floating wind turbine could change the clean energy game

The Dounreay Tri Floating Wind Demonstration is a step in the right direction. Scotland is investing a lot in offshore wind energy projects. This wind turbine is not anchored to the bottom, as is the case with most wind turbines in water. This one floats. Two turbines share a floating platform, which makes the whole setup look kind of like the famed cryptid beast, the Loch Ness Monster, as it floats on the waters, charged with the task of servicing power requirements with clean energy.

Dounreay Tri Ltd is responsible for its construction, and they have been supported in this endeavor in part by the Scottish government, with the added aid of private investors. This idea of a floating wind turbine has always been relished as these are less disruptive to marine life, but the journey in realizing this has been fraught with trial and error. This design is sure to shake things up.

What makes this floating wind turbine particularly special

The aerodynamics involved are where the true genius lies when it comes to this wind turbine. Wake loss is reduced, the effect when one turbine impedes the efficiency of another. These combine well together and create a vortex above the water with very little interference between the two turbines. The two turbines actually help each other out. Together, they create an effect where each one helps the other to spin at an effective rate.

This is a significant time for wind power, and this turbine could help usher in a new era for this kind of clean energy. Scotland is on the front lines of this with their two-headed “Loch Ness monster.”

Wind power in Scotland will never be the same again

Scotland would like to be able to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. Perhaps this wind turbine could help. Scotland is windy, and the waters of its seas and lakes are known to be deep. Traditional wind turbines over water just won’t cut it in an environment like that. This two-headed turbine does make the grade. Each turbine is a 10 megawatt Vestas model floating on a platform. The turbine is kept secure by chains and cables.

Experts say this wind turbine could provide clean power for thousands of homes. The project has also helped from an economic standpoint as a lot of jobs have been made available because of it, with Orkney and Caithness being the major beneficiaries at the moment.

When this turbine goes live, real-world data will help shape the way forward

Once this project enters the next phase beyond testing, and real-world data is able to be examined, the design team will be able to further make adjustments and improve on what is already a brilliant idea. The world is watching as well, with companies from Norway, Japan, and America showing interest in the two-headed design. The costs it will save are a major drawcard, all while rendering 15% more power than the single-turret wind turbine.",https://www.ecoportal.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DounreayTri_Hexicon_large-2017031712272828-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 05:18:53.516078

What's happening?

According to The Guardian, Miliband is considering a proposal that would allow companies to extract more oil and gas from existing sites using a new ""bespoke permitting"" system. The plan would incentivize companies to revisit and drill in older, previously abandoned fields.

Proponents claim this approach would ""speed up the process of evaluation and development"" while protecting jobs tied to the industry.

The oil industry has maintained it could recover more than 7 billion barrels of additional fuel from the North Sea under this system, but climate scientists say that would make it much harder for the U.K. to meet its target to reach net zero by 2050.

Why is continued dirty fuel extraction concerning?

Environmental groups have said this approach could keep the country locked into dirty energy dependency when it should be rapidly scaling up renewables like offshore wind to meet its net-zero target.

""While we remain distracted by ever-diminishing amounts of oil and gas, we are missing the huge opportunities to create good, clean energy jobs in the U.K,"" Tessa Khan, executive director of the climate group Uplift, told The Guardian.

The North Sea has long been a cornerstone of Britain's energy economy, employing about 30,000 people in northeast Scotland.

However, the dirty fuel industry remains the leading driver of global pollution, responsible for the majority of carbon and methane emissions heating our atmosphere. According to the United Nations, it accounts for 68% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 90% of all carbon dioxide emissions.

From drilling to refining and burning, every stage of oil and gas production contributes to environmental destruction, polluting air and water, harming wildlife, and threatening human health.

Despite this, major oil companies continue to lobby against clean energy policies, delaying the transition to renewables and prolonging dependence on fuels that destabilize our planet.

What's being done about dirty fuel dependency?

The International Energy Agency has stated that no new oil and gas developments can be approved if the world is to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Continuing to extract from aging fields, critics say, would release more carbon and methane into the atmosphere while delaying investments in the renewable energy transition.

The U.K. government insists it can balance both goals, but environmentalists warn that this loophole-permitting strategy could extend dirty fuel dependence for decades when the planet can least afford it.

Having conversations about these issues and voting for pro-climate candidates are critical steps that can help protect people and the environment.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/North-Sea-drillingimage-recRRLFv1Jb00lXO5-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 03:18:39.761091

The Inflation Reduction Act didn’t just expand renewable energy—it created one of the most powerful financial incentives in modern U.S. history for companies producing, processing, or supporting clean energy technologies.

At Icarus Fund, we’ve worked with renewable developers and manufacturers that turned complex tax law into cash flow—literally. One client converted an abandoned coal plant into a battery recycling hub, unlocking over $30 million in 48C credits and attracting new investors overnight. That’s the level of opportunity sitting on the table right now if you know how to qualify.

Let’s break it down: what the 48C Credit is, who qualifies, and how your company can use it to supercharge your next project.

The 48C Advanced Energy Project Credit eligibility framework was built to accelerate the United States’ clean energy transition by funding domestic manufacturing, retrofits, and emission-reduction projects.

Originally launched under the 2009 Recovery Act, the 48C Credit was reborn under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—and this time, it’s bigger, bolder, and far more accessible.

Here’s what makes it special:

It’s an Investment Tax Credit (ITC) that can cover up to 30% of eligible project costs.

It applies to both new facilities and retrofitted plants focused on clean energy production or carbon reduction.

The Department of Energy (DOE) and the IRS jointly manage allocations—so compliance matters at every stage.

Put simply, 48C isn’t just a rebate—it’s a capital strategy.

Not all zip codes are created equal.

The 48C Advanced Energy Project Credit eligibility rules prioritize projects built in “energy communities”—areas hit hardest by the fossil fuel phaseout.

These locations get an extra 10% bonus, meaning a potential 40% total credit if you meet labor standards.

Here’s the kicker:

Energy communities include former coal towns, refinery hubs, and industrial zones.

Building in these areas also gives you a competitive edge during the DOE review.

One of our clients strategically built a recycling plant in Appalachia—a qualified energy community—and secured an additional $8 million in tax incentives just from location-based bonuses.

Policymakers and private enterprises around the world are adopting an all-of-the-above approach to energy sourcing – clean energy pledges be damned – in order to shore up energy security in an era of unprecedented flux. Governments around the world are greenlighting new projects to boost energy production as fast as they can in an attempt to stay one step ahead of looming energy shortages, while tech moguls bet big on proven as well as unproven energy technologies. But while the AI boom is boosting investments for energy sources from geothermal to nuclear fusion, the world’s biggest energy source is missing out on the influx of cash that seems to be flowing into every other sector.

Or rather, the amount of AI-inspired dollars flowing into Big Oil’s coffers simply isn’t enough to offset the considerable headwinds faced by the sector today. Despite a rabidly supportive policy environment in the United States and ever-increasing sanctions on Russia, The Economist reports that “times are surprisingly tough for the industry.” Even with ballooning energy demand projections, oil demand has remained soft, and global oil producers are steadily building up a serious oil glut with no signs of relief.

Earlier this month, the International Energy Agency raised its estimate for next year's oil glut, predicting a record oversupply for 2026. According to the agency’s official estimates, global oil supply will exceed demand by nearly 4 million barrels a day, potentially breaking the record for the biggest supply glut in history in annual terms.

Oil companies have been underperforming since before this increased projection hit the markets. “Since the start of last year the S&P 500 index of large American companies has produced a total return, including dividends, of 46%,” reports The Economist. “By contrast, American pedlars [sic] of oil and gas, including giants such as Chevron and Exxon, have returned just 14%.”

Meanwhile, seemingly every other energy sector is going gangbusters. Money is pouring into nuclear energy startups at such a rapid clip that there are rumblings of a bubble. Last year, private equity and venture capital investments in advanced nuclear companies hit an all-time high, “surpass[ing] the total deal value of the past 15 years combined” according to S&P Global.

Even nuclear fusion, which does not yet exist in any commercially viable form, is receiving a windfall of research and development dollars, riding on the back of the AI boom. Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI – the firm behind ChatGPT – and arguably the number one poster child of the AI sector, is also one of the world’s biggest proponents of and investors in nuclear fusion technology. He has personally poured hundreds of millions of dollars into nuclear fusion startups and headed one of the world’s buzziest potential fusion unicorns, Oklo. in part thanks to his high-profile confidence in the technology’s singular ability to meet AI’s future energy needs, a report by E.U. firm Fusion for Energy finds that the sector’s total funding has skyrocketed from US $1.7 billion in 2020 to US $15 billion as of September 2025.

At the same time, the geothermal energy market is emerging from niche status into mainstream energy investment portfolios. In 2023, the global market for geothermal energy was valued at USD 7.4 billion. It’s projected to reach a whopping USD 12.51 billion by 2032. The investment dollars are piling up as Big Tech gets bullish on the baseload clean energy. Meta and Alphabet (the companies behind Facebook and Google) are listed among the growing number of Silicon Valley firms partnering with geothermal startups. Earlier this year, Cindy Taff, chief executive of geothermal company Sage Geosystems, told The Hill that “It’s going to be the decade of geothermal.”

But while even the most fringe and emergent forms of energy are soaring to new heights from the AI boom, Big Oil is struggling to benefit from the windfall. Even as Wood Mackenzie pushes back peak oil projections to 2032, supermajors are resorting to layoffs and handing out dividends instead of reinvesting in expansion in what The Economist calls “a sure sign that Western oilmen are feeling downcast about their industry’s growth prospects.”

Critical minerals strategy represents far more than simple resource procurement in today's interconnected world. These comprehensive governmental frameworks address fundamental vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional economic considerations into realms of national security and technological sovereignty. Understanding the critical minerals energy transition becomes essential as nations grapple with supply chain dependencies.

Modern critical minerals strategy encompasses several interconnected components working in unison. Supply chain mapping reveals dependency patterns that can expose national vulnerabilities during geopolitical tensions. Domestic production capacity development creates buffer zones against foreign manipulation, while international partnership frameworks diversify risk across allied nations. Strategic reserve management provides emergency stockpiles during supply disruptions, and technology innovation support drives long-term solutions to current dependencies.

The urgency driving these strategies becomes clear when examining current realities. Analysis shows that even with optimal investment scenarios totaling $50-75 billion and flawless execution across allied nations, Western countries may only achieve 50% rare earth independence by 2035-2040. This projection illustrates the magnitude of current vulnerabilities and the extended timelines required for meaningful supply chain restructuring.

Environmental and social governance standards increasingly shape critical minerals strategy implementation. Modern approaches must balance security imperatives with sustainability requirements, creating frameworks that ensure responsible extraction and processing while maintaining strategic objectives.

What Makes Minerals ""Critical"" to National Security?

Critical mineral designation stems from a precise intersection of economic importance and supply vulnerability. These materials achieve critical status through their essential roles in defense applications, clean energy infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing processes, combined with concentrated geographic production that creates strategic dependencies.

The classification process considers multiple risk factors simultaneously. Essential defense applications include weapons guidance systems, advanced armor materials, and sophisticated communications equipment. Clean energy infrastructure dependencies encompass battery storage systems, wind turbine components, and solar panel manufacturing. Limited geographic concentration creates chokepoints where single nations control large portions of global supply chains.

Current data reveals the extent of these vulnerabilities. China maintains control over 85-90% of refined rare earth oxides and magnet production globally, creating a strategic dependency that extends far beyond simple commodity trading into the realm of economic statecraft.

Critical Mineral Categories by Strategic Application:

Technology Sector Key Minerals Strategic Importance Defense Systems Rare Earth Elements, Titanium Weapons guidance, advanced armor Clean Energy Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel Battery storage, wind turbines Electronics Germanium, Indium, Gallium Semiconductors, display technology Infrastructure Copper, Aluminum, Steel Alloys Power transmission, construction

Substitution difficulty represents another crucial factor in critical mineral designation. Materials earning critical status typically lack readily available alternatives, meaning supply disruptions cannot be easily resolved through material substitution. This characteristic amplifies the strategic importance of maintaining reliable supply chains.

Economic impact assessment examines potential GDP-level consequences of supply disruptions across various sectors. Critical minerals often serve as inputs for multiple downstream industries, creating cascading effects when supply chains face disruption.

How Do Geopolitical Tensions Shape Critical Minerals Strategy?

Geopolitical competition fundamentally alters how nations approach critical minerals, transforming traditional commodity relationships into strategic considerations. Current global dynamics reveal sharp contrasts in national approaches, with significant implications for long-term supply security.

China's approach demonstrates vertically integrated, systematically subsidised operations that function as instruments of statecraft rather than purely commercial endeavours. This model enables rapid policy implementation across entire supply chains, creating competitive advantages that extend beyond simple cost considerations. A single policy decree from Beijing can significantly impact global supply chains or influence market pricing through strategic interventions.

Western approaches face structural challenges in responding to this coordinated strategy. Fragmented decision-making processes, regulatory complexities, and market-driven priorities often conflict with long-term strategic planning requirements. Environmental permitting challenges and community engagement requirements, while important for sustainable development, extend project timelines significantly compared to competitor nations.

Long development timelines for mining projects in Western nations create additional vulnerabilities. New mining operations typically require 10-15 years from initial exploration through production, creating extended windows where supply chain dependencies persist. This timeline disparity becomes particularly problematic when competitor nations can rapidly adjust production capacity through centralised planning mechanisms.

Supply chain vulnerability analysis reveals concerning concentration patterns. Limited refining and processing capacity outside Asia creates bottlenecks even when raw materials are available from diverse sources. Western nations may control mining operations while remaining dependent on Asian processing facilities for finished materials.

""Strategic Reality Check: Even with massive investment and perfect execution, Western nations face 10-15 years to achieve partial supply chain independence, highlighting the structural nature of current dependencies.""

Regional permitting and regulatory frameworks create additional competitive disadvantages. Where some nations measure project approval timelines in months, Western regulatory processes often extend across multiple years, creating predictable delays that competitors can exploit through strategic market timing.

Building Domestic Critical Minerals Capabilities

Successful domestic capability development requires coordinated investment across multiple interconnected stages of the supply chain. Each component must scale appropriately to avoid creating new bottlenecks that simply shift vulnerabilities rather than eliminating them. Furthermore, implementing AI in mining operations can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs.

Mining and Extraction Infrastructure

Modern mining capability development extends far beyond traditional extraction operations. Geological survey expansion provides detailed resource mapping that guides long-term investment decisions. Comprehensive permitting process reforms can significantly reduce project timelines while maintaining environmental standards. Environmental impact mitigation technologies enable responsible extraction that meets both production and sustainability objectives.

Community engagement protocols ensure local stakeholder support throughout project lifecycles. Successful mining operations increasingly depend on collaborative relationships with local communities, creating shared value that extends beyond immediate economic benefits.

However, some operations face significant challenges, particularly regarding deep-sea mining concerns which highlight the complex environmental considerations in modern extraction strategies.

Processing and Refining Capacity

Midstream processing represents the most critical bottleneck in many supply chains. Refining facilities require substantial capital investment and specialised technical expertise that takes years to develop. The warning against overbuilding extraction capacity while underbuilding processing capabilities highlights a fundamental strategic principle: supply chain strength depends on the weakest link, not the strongest.

Technology transfer initiatives can accelerate capability development by leveraging existing expertise from allied nations. However, such transfers require careful management to ensure genuine capability building rather than continued dependency relationships. For instance, establishing an European CRM facility demonstrates regional approaches to processing independence.

Skilled workforce training programmes must anticipate long-term industry needs while providing immediate employment opportunities. Vocational certainty across the value chain creates stable career pathways that attract talent to critical sectors.

Manufacturing Integration

End-product manufacturing capabilities complete the domestic supply chain by eliminating dependencies on foreign final assembly. This integration prevents situations where domestic raw material production simply feeds foreign manufacturing capacity.

Quality control systems ensure domestic production meets international standards while maintaining cost competitiveness. Supply chain integration connects domestic extraction, processing, and manufacturing into coherent systems that maximise value retention within national borders.

Investment Requirements for Domestic Capability Building:

Capability Area Investment Range Timeline Key Challenges Mining Infrastructure $20-50 billion globally 5-10 years Permitting, environmental compliance Processing Facilities $30-75 billion globally 3-7 years Technology transfer, skilled workforce R&D Programmes $5-15 billion globally 3-5 years Technical breakthroughs, scaling Workforce Development $2-5 billion globally 2-4 years Training programmes, talent retention

International Cooperation in Critical Minerals Strategy

No single nation possesses sufficient critical mineral resources to achieve complete independence, making international cooperation essential for supply security. Strategic partnerships enable resource sharing while distributing development costs and risks across multiple participants.

Effective partnership models balance resource access with technology sharing. Resource-rich nations provide raw materials while technology-advanced nations contribute processing expertise and manufacturing capabilities. These arrangements create mutual dependencies that strengthen rather than weaken participant nations.

Synchronised Global Alliance structures represent the most comprehensive approach to international cooperation. Such alliances coordinate production capacity, share strategic reserves, and standardise quality specifications across member nations. The emphasis on tight orchestration and synchronisation reflects lessons learned from fragmented approaches that create gaps competitors can exploit.

Bilateral mining agreements provide focused relationships between specific nations with complementary capabilities. These agreements often include long-term supply commitments, technology sharing provisions, and joint investment structures that spread financial risks. Australia's approach follows the Critical Minerals Strategy 2023-2030, which outlines comprehensive frameworks for international partnerships.

Multilateral supply chain initiatives create broader frameworks for cooperation among groups of allied nations. These initiatives can establish common standards, coordinate research programmes, and provide collective responses to supply disruptions.

Joint strategic reserve systems enable participating nations to share stockpile costs while maintaining access during emergencies. Such systems require careful governance structures to ensure equitable access while preventing free-rider problems.

What Role Do Strategic Reserves Play in Supply Security?

Strategic reserves function as insurance policies against supply disruptions while providing market stabilisation mechanisms during volatile periods. Modern reserve strategies extend beyond simple stockpiling to include dynamic management approaches that respond to changing market conditions.

Reserve composition must balance immediate availability with long-term storage considerations. Physical stockpiles of refined materials provide rapid response capability during supply crises, while long-term supply contracts offer price stability and guaranteed access over extended periods.

Price floor mechanisms, such as those implemented by defence agencies for specific materials, create market stability that encourages private investment in domestic production capacity. These interventions signal government commitment to maintaining viable domestic industries even during periods of foreign price manipulation.

Emergency production capacity represents another component of strategic reserves. Maintaining ability to rapidly increase production during crises requires keeping facilities operational even when not economically optimal under normal market conditions.

Strategic Reserve Approaches by Region:

Region Reserve Focus Key Features Management Approach United States National Defense Stockpile Military-focused materials Government-managed Japan Comprehensive stockpiling Private-public partnerships Industry collaboration South Korea Technology metals Advanced materials focus Strategic coordination European Union Critical Raw Materials Circular economy integration Distributed management

Recycling and recovery systems increasingly integrate with strategic reserves to create circular material flows. Advanced recycling technologies can potentially supply 20-30% of critical mineral demand by 2030, significantly reducing primary extraction requirements and strategic stockpile pressures.

Technology Innovation in Critical Minerals Strategy

Technology innovation drives both increasing demand for critical minerals and potential solutions to supply challenges. Innovation strategies must simultaneously address efficiency improvements, alternative material development, and new extraction methodologies. Consequently, exploring asteroid mining advances presents long-term opportunities for supply diversification.

Extraction efficiency improvements can significantly increase recoverable resources from existing deposits. Advanced processing techniques often enable economic extraction of previously sub-economic ore bodies, effectively expanding available supply without discovering new deposits.

Alternative material development represents the most transformative potential solution to critical mineral dependencies. Successful substitutes can eliminate strategic vulnerabilities entirely, though development timelines often extend 10-15 years from laboratory breakthrough to commercial viability.

Processing automation reduces both operational costs and skilled labour requirements, addressing two significant barriers to domestic production development. Automated facilities can maintain consistent quality while reducing exposure to supply chain disruptions in specialised technical expertise.

Supply chain digitisation enables real-time monitoring and optimisation of material flows from extraction through final manufacturing. Digital systems can identify bottlenecks, predict maintenance requirements, and optimise inventory management across complex supply networks.

""Innovation Opportunity: Advanced recycling technologies represent immediate potential for supply chain independence, with implementations possible within 3-5 years compared to 10-15 years for new mining operations.""

Research and development investment requirements typically range from 2-5% of sector revenue to drive meaningful innovation. Government support often proves essential for basic research that private companies cannot justify economically despite strategic importance.

Economic Implications of Critical Minerals Strategy

Critical minerals strategy implementation creates substantial economic opportunities alongside security benefits. Nations investing comprehensively in domestic capabilities position themselves advantageously in emerging technology markets while reducing strategic vulnerabilities.

Job creation spans entire value chains, from geological exploration through final product manufacturing. These positions often provide above-average wages while creating economic opportunities in regions that can benefit from industrial development.

Export revenue generation becomes possible as domestic capacity exceeds national requirements. Nations successfully developing critical minerals capabilities can transition from import dependency to export capability, fundamentally altering trade relationships.

Technology sector competitiveness depends increasingly on reliable access to critical materials. Domestic supply chains provide cost predictability and delivery reliability that enhance broader industrial competitiveness. The International Energy Agency's analysis confirms these economic benefits across developed nations.

Industrial base strengthening occurs as critical minerals capabilities support broader manufacturing ecosystems. Processing facilities often enable related industries to develop, creating industrial clusters that generate additional economic benefits.

Economic Impact Assessment:

Economic Factor Immediate Benefits Long-term Benefits Risk Considerations Employment Construction jobs Permanent operations Skill requirements Trade Balance Import reduction Export potential Market volatility Regional Development Infrastructure investment Industrial clustering Environmental impact Innovation R&D investment Technology leadership Competition risks

Investment requirements, while substantial, generate returns through multiple channels. Direct economic benefits include employment, tax revenue, and export income. Indirect benefits encompass supply chain security, industrial competitiveness, and strategic autonomy.

Measuring Success in Critical Minerals Strategy Implementation

Effective strategy implementation requires comprehensive measurement systems that track progress across multiple dimensions simultaneously. Success indicators must balance quantitative metrics with qualitative assessments of strategic objective achievement.

Supply chain diversification ratios measure progress in reducing dependency on single-source suppliers. Target ranges typically aim for less than 70% import dependency for critical materials, though optimal ratios vary based on specific mineral characteristics and strategic importance.

Domestic production capacity growth tracks development of extraction, processing, and manufacturing capabilities within national borders. Meaningful capacity development often requires 5-10 years, making intermediate milestone tracking essential for strategy management.

Strategic reserve adequacy levels assess whether stockpiles can support national requirements during various disruption scenarios. Reserve calculations must consider consumption rates, critical application priorities, and expected disruption durations.

Critical Minerals Strategy Success Metrics:

Metric Category Key Indicators Target Ranges Measurement Frequency Supply Security Import dependency ratio <70% for critical materials Annual assessment Economic Impact Value-added processing >40% domestic processing Quarterly tracking Innovation R&D investment ratio 2-5% of sector revenue Annual evaluation Sustainability Environmental compliance 100% regulatory adherence Continuous monitoring

Technology innovation metrics evaluate research and development effectiveness, patent development, and successful technology transfer rates. Innovation success often requires 3-5 year measurement cycles to capture development timelines accurately.

International partnership effectiveness measures collaborative success through shared capacity development, reserve coordination, and crisis response capability. Partnership metrics require careful design to capture mutual benefit achievement rather than simple transaction volumes.

Future Challenges and Opportunities in Critical Minerals Strategy

The critical minerals landscape continues evolving rapidly, driven by accelerating technological change, ambitious climate policies, and shifting geopolitical relationships. Future strategies must anticipate emerging challenges while positioning to capitalise on new opportunities.

Increasing demand from clean energy transition creates both challenges and opportunities for critical minerals strategy. Battery storage requirements alone could increase lithium demand 10-20 times current levels by 2040, while wind turbine expansion drives rare earth element consumption growth.

Resource quality degradation represents a long-term challenge as highest-grade deposits face depletion. Future extraction operations may require processing lower-grade ores, increasing costs and environmental impacts while reducing economic viability of marginal operations.

Climate change impacts on mining operations create additional complexity for long-term planning. Water availability changes, extreme weather events, and temperature increases affect both extraction operations and processing facility performance.

Emerging Strategic Opportunities:

Deep-sea mining potential: Ocean floor deposits could provide access to critical minerals without traditional land-based environmental constraints

Space resource utilisation: Asteroid mining represents long-term potential for abundant critical mineral supplies, though technological and economic barriers remain substantial

Biotechnology applications: Biological extraction and processing methods could reduce environmental impacts while improving efficiency

Artificial intelligence optimisation: Machine learning systems can optimise extraction, processing, and supply chain management across complex operations

Evolving geopolitical relationships require flexible strategy frameworks that can adapt to changing alliance structures and competitive dynamics. Fixed strategies risk becoming obsolete as international relationships shift over 10-20 year implementation timelines.

Implementing Effective Critical Minerals Strategy

Successful implementation requires coordinated action across government agencies, private industry, and academic institutions. Clear governance structures, adequate funding mechanisms, and sustained stakeholder alignment prove essential for achieving long-term strategic objectives.

Leadership structure establishment represents the foundation for effective implementation. A dedicated critical minerals authority with cross-agency coordination power and substantial budget allocation provides the institutional capability necessary for comprehensive strategy execution. Historical precedents from major national initiatives demonstrate the importance of centralised coordination with clear accountability structures.

Funding mechanisms must balance public investment with private sector participation. Public-private partnerships can leverage government strategic priorities with private sector efficiency and innovation capability. Strategic investment often requires patient capital that accepts longer return timelines in exchange for strategic benefits.

Regulatory reform enables rapid capability development while maintaining necessary environmental and safety standards. Industrial corridors with streamlined permitting processes can reduce project timelines from decades to months, creating competitive advantages for domestic operations.

Implementation Framework Components:

Centralised Authority: Critical minerals czar with cross-agency coordination power

Financial Structure: Public-private partnerships with patient capital availability

Regulatory Environment: Streamlined permitting for strategic projects

Stakeholder Coordination: Industry-government collaboration mechanisms

Performance Management: Regular strategy assessment and adaptive adjustment

Stakeholder engagement ensures alignment between government objectives, industry capabilities, and community interests. Successful implementation requires ongoing dialogue and coordination among all participants throughout extended development timelines.

Performance monitoring enables adaptive strategy management as conditions change over 10-20 year implementation periods. Regular assessment and strategy adjustment capabilities ensure continued relevance as technological, economic, and geopolitical factors evolve.

""Implementation Success Factor: Countries achieving the greatest progress in critical minerals strategy typically establish dedicated coordination authorities with substantial budgets and clear accountability for measurable outcomes across multi-year timelines.""

The magnitude of current supply chain dependencies and the extended timelines required for meaningful independence highlight the urgency of comprehensive critical minerals strategy implementation. Nations that successfully balance security imperatives with economic opportunities while maintaining environmental and social responsibility will position themselves advantageously for the technological and geopolitical challenges of the coming decades.

The deals, announced this week, bring Meta’s total solar power purchases in 2025 to more than 3 gigawatts — a significant milestone that underscores how tech giants are increasingly turning to renewables to power their expanding fleets of data centers.

Solar energy has become a favorite among major technology firms for its relatively low cost, scalability, and rapid construction timelines. Meta’s latest investments are spread across Louisiana and Texas, with completion expected over the next two years.

The company unveiled two agreements in Louisiana on Thursday that involve purchasing the environmental attributes of 385 megawatts of electricity. Both projects are slated to be operational by 2027. Earlier in the week, Meta announced an even larger deal — a 600-megawatt purchase from a massive solar farm near Lubbock, Texas, also set to begin commercial operations in 2027.

While the Texas solar project won’t directly power Meta’s data centers, it will feed electricity into the regional grid to offset the company’s overall consumption. The Louisiana projects, however, center around environmental attribute certificates (EACs), which allow Meta to balance out emissions from carbon-intensive sources.

EACs, also known as renewable energy certificates, have faced scrutiny from environmental analysts who argue that they can mask the true carbon footprint of companies whose actual operations continue to rely heavily on traditional power sources.

Still, Meta’s latest renewable investments highlight the growing urgency within the tech sector to secure clean energy as AI-driven data processing dramatically increases electricity demand. With competitors such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google also expanding their renewable portfolios, the race to power AI sustainably has become one of the defining challenges of the industry’s next phase.",https://slguardian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/468396449.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 03:18:46.136561

They looked at emissions from fuel production, battery manufacturing, vehicle assembly, and operation for both electric and gas-powered cars.
They found the economic value of the damages attributable to gas-powered cars over their estimated lifetime of 18 years, amounted to 2 to 3.5 times that of EVs.","A new study has looked into whether electric cars are really better for the environment than gas-powered cars. It turns out that this is indeed the case: after two years of use, EVs start reducing their total carbon footprint compared to gas cars.

That's from scientists at Duke University, who carried out research supported by the Albemarle Corporation – a North Carolina-based chemical manufacturing firm involved in the battery value chain for automakers. The peer-reviewed study has been published this week in the journal PLOS Climate.

Okay, so now we know where the findings are coming from. Let's look at what else the researchers observed. Their study confirms that building an EV starts off with about 30% higher CO2 emissions than a regular internal combustion engine (ICE) car. That can be attributed to largely to mining the lithium for the EV's battery, and manufacturing said battery.

But once you get this EV on the road, it begins to make up for its emissions pretty quickly, and wipes the slate clean after two years when compared to a gas car covering the same distance.

To arrive at this, the researchers used the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) – which helps examine how the world's energy, economy, and climate systems interact over long time periods – to evaluate air pollutant emissions across four scenarios of increasing EV adoption in the US through the year 2050. They looked at emissions from fuel production, battery manufacturing, vehicle assembly, and operation for both electric and gas-powered cars.

Besides the reduction in CO2 emissions after the initial two years, as battery output increases over time, each additional kWh of an electric car's lithium-ion battery output is projected to lead to a reduction of about 485 lb (220 kg) of CO2 in 2030, and 280 lb (127 kg) of CO2 by the time 2050 rolls around.

The reseacrhers also looked at the overall effects of both air pollution and climate change for both types of cars. They found the economic value of the damages attributable to gas-powered cars over their estimated lifetime of 18 years, amounted to 2 to 3.5 times that of EVs. That includes things like the social cost of healthcare for humans who suffer from conditions brought on by polluted air.

It's worth noting that these findings are derived from computer modeling and scenario simulation. The study also didn't account for a number of categories of emissions, including those associated with disposing or recycling components from both types of vehicles, and those that would be generated in the processing of setting up charging infrastructure for EVs.

Still, this does help inform the discourse around just how green EVs can be, and how we think about the benefits of moving away from gas-powered vehicles as technologies, infrastructure, and public policies in countries around the world continue to evolve.",https://assets.newatlas.com/dims4/default/104388c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3c%2F06%2F64a819f54dbeb63ec3bbc6ebee64%2Fafter-just-two-years-on-the-road-evs-actually-start-reducing-their-total-carbon-footprint-compared-to-gas-cars.jpg&na.image_optimisation=0,N,,2025-11-02 01:18:10.906187

The state purchased the building and its associated property for nearly $2 million last year, following a recommendation from the State Office Task Force, Rep. Lloyd Larsen, R-Lander, explained at the beginning of Tuesday’s meeting.

At the time, he noted, the state was already leasing space in the building for the Department of Health, the Department of Family Services, the driver’s license division of the Wyoming Department of Transportation, and the Department of Agriculture.

“The task force … recommended that the building be refurbished to accommodate additional agencies and to contract with the design firm to do a Level II and Level III study to determine what level of renovation would be required and how best to add the Department of Workforce Services, the Veterans Affairs and the Department of Revenue into the building,” Larsen said.

Level II

The Level II design, created in coordination with the state agencies that will occupy the building, aims to preserve as much of the original structure as possible, Prospect Studio Principal Danny Wicke said – though “some pieces and parts” will have to be demolished.

For example, he said, the lower-level locker rooms, fitness facility, and sauna “really aren’t applicable to the new use of the building” and will be removed – as will the existing staircase leading to the first-floor entryway, which doesn’t meet current code requirements.

“It’s an open stair,” Wicke explained. “It’s not enclosed. And the current stair configuration does not meet the requirements of life safety.”

In order to make space for the updated staircase, Wicke said the design team proposed adding a “front porch” style element to the front of the building, which will provide a more “gracious entry” and also allow room for the current elevator shaft to be expanded and repositioned to accommodate a “new, modern elevator.”

Wicke said the layout for the first floor was also revised to meet Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, accommodate other life safety elements, and meet the needs of the state agencies that will reside there: the Department of Workforce Services, the WYDOT, and the Department of Revenue.

Larsen pointed out that the Department of Workforce Services currently occupies two offices locally, creating a “bifurcation of the agency.”

“This (new plan) brings the whole agency into this level of the building,” he said.

He also noted that the local Department of Revenue office is currently in an “isolated” location that is “a little concerning.”

“We’re glad that we’re able to bring them into this consolidation,” he said.

Second floor

Similar revisions will be needed on the upper floor of the building, which was originally designed to meet the needs of U.S. Energy’s “C-suite executives,” Wicke said.

“Most of the offices were pushed around the perimeter of the building, and then there’s quite a lot of open space in the middle,” he said.

“The offices were for more executive-level people, and they’re quite large,” Wicke said. “So one of the purposes of revisiting this upper floor was to try to also economize this (space).”

One of the proposed strategies for making the upper level more “efficient” is to install a dropped ceiling, which will leave space below the original vaulted ceiling for mechanical equipment and accommodate the removal of the skylights that are currently in place on the roof, Wicke said.

“Those skylights are (a) leaking point and don’t really make a lot of sense if we’re going to have a ceiling in,” he explained. “So, we propose removing those and … getting this to a roof that’s pretty simple.”

The second floor’s vaulted ceilings will remain in place over the lobby area, he noted.

“From an architectural standpoint, that is one expression we’re trying to maintain in the building, because it’s there, (and) it’s beautiful,” he said.

The upper floor will house the Department of Family Services, the Department of Health, the Wyoming Military Department, and the Department of Agriculture, Wicke said, and the basement floor includes storage space for the agencies that need it.

The basement will also house the boiler, which needs to be upgraded along with the building’s electrical and mechanical systems, Wicke said.

Parking

Wicke shared several proposed changes for the areas surrounding the U.S. Energy building this week, too.

For example, he said the current parking area could be shifted east and expanded to provide more than 100 parking spaces that members of the public can access from West Sunset Drive.

The move would allow the “circuitous and tight ramp” that currently leads from the parking lot to the entryway to be redesigned to “reduce the amount of elevation” people experience as they approach the building, Wicke said.

Meanwhile, he said state employees could use a smaller, secure parking lot located on the southwest side of the property, accessible from North Eighth Street West.

“(That’s) also the access route to get down to the garage,” Wicke said. “So you would go through a state-controlled parking area in order to access the lower garage. We think that provides more security.”

Following completion of the Level II designs, state officials said they will proceed to Level III of the U.S. Energy project, focusing on additional agency coordination and development of construction documents.

“(We) look forward to seeing what will take place,” Larsen said.

The task force concluded this week’s meeting by approving a bill draft that would dissolve their committee next spring – two years earlier than originally planned.

“We’ve done all that we needed to do,” Larsen said. “Our assigned tasks have been completed. The remaining work falls under the jurisdiction of the State Construction Department and the Department of (Administration and Information).”","https://cdn.county10.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect,metadata=none/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/usenergyaerial.jpg",N,,2025-11-02 00:17:50.669363

Nuclear power.
The bill lifts a longstanding moratorium on large-scale nuclear power plants, but it also hikes fees for nuclear plant operators.","A closely-watched and long-debated piece of energy legislation is set to become law after passing through both legislative chambers with the governor’s endorsement.

The bill that cleared the General Assembly Thursday funds energy storage systems through a new charge to Illinois electric customers that will take effect in 2030. The bill also lifts a longtime ban on new nuclear power developments and gives new authority to state utility regulators.

Proponents say the bill will lower costs for utility customers, but critics worry that a lack of cost-control measures will increase electricity prices for Illinois residents.

“Here’s the bottom line in my view: this package is about making energy more affordable for ratepayers in years ahead. We’re getting more energy on the grid,” bill sponsor Sen. Steve Stadelman, a Rockford Democrat, said Thursday. “If we do nothing … the rates are going to continue to go up.”

The Illinois Senate approved Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — Thursday evening, 37-22. That follows the House of Representatives approving it Wednesday night, 70-37.

It next heads to Gov. JB Pritzker, who pledged to sign the bill Thursday, noting that “what we’re trying to do is lower electricity costs.”

Pritzker’s office was heavily involved in negotiations around the bill throughout its tumultuous legislative history.

Versions of the bill date back to negotiations in 2024, with initial talks of an energy package cropping up in the weeks ahead of a January 2025 lame duck session. Drafts of the bill circulated throughout the spring legislative session before ultimately being abandoned.

Senate Bill 25 — which supporters call the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — is the largest change to Illinois’ energy policy in at least four years. Among its core policies:

Battery storage. The core of the bill is a new incentive structure for energy storage projects. The incentives are broadly similar to how the state funds renewable developments like wind and solar power. They will result in new charges to ratepayers, although proponents say that savings from more storage on the grid will offset costs.

Energy efficiency. The bill adds new requirements for energy efficiency programs at natural gas and electric utilities. These are aimed at reducing energy demand and proponents of the measure say they will lower prices for consumers.

Nuclear power. The bill lifts a longstanding moratorium on large-scale nuclear power plants, but it also hikes fees for nuclear plant operators.

New authority for regulators. The Illinois Commerce Commission, the state’s utility regulator, would gain new authority for “integrated resource planning,” a way of setting long-term plans to control both supply-side issues, like plans for electric generation, as well as managing demand.

Labor protections. New requirements for community solar projects would close a loophole that some developers were using to avoid hiring union labor. This was a major priority for organized labor groups during negotiations.

Data centers air regulations. The bill places new requirements on the backup generators used by data centers, which require always-on power to operate.

Virtual power plants and time-of-use. The bill requires large utilities to create “virtual power plant” programs and time-of-use rate plans. This allows utilities to use small-scale residential solar and battery projects to deliver energy throughout the day.

Geothermal energy. The bill outlines a program to fund geothermal heating, a technology which uses naturally occurring heat from underground to offset the need for electric or fossil fuel-based heating.

Thermal energy networks. A new state-backed loan program would fund thermal energy network projects. These use water-filled pipes to transfer heat between energy-intensive buildings, wastewater systems and bodies of water. They can also use geothermal energy to manage heat.

A cadre of advocacy groups, renewable industry associations and lawmakers praised the bill’s passage.

The governor said the bill was a positive step toward affordability at a time when renewable energy faces expensive headwinds across the U.S.

“For far too long, private grid operators have been hiking up rates that are making it harder for Illinois families to pay their utility bills,” Pritzker said in a statement. “At the same time, the Trump Administration has been blocking the ability to bring lower-cost energy options online.”

President Donald Trump’s domestic policy package, passed earlier this summer, sent shock waves through the renewable industry as it ended subsidies and incentives for electric vehicles, wind power projects, solar installation and other policies key to funding renewable development.

David Braun, head of sales and marketing for the Illinois-based renewable tech company Intelligent Generation, said that law caused “a lot of shock and uncertainty” but that the industry was “figuring it out.”

Illinois’ bill, according to Braun, signals that the future is bright for renewables.

“It’s good news for the industry, and I think it’s good news for the state of Illinois and for ratepayers,” Braun said.

The bill incentivizes new storage projects, which state officials at the Illinois Power Agency found will suppress electricity prices in an analysis they provided to lawmakers. It also mandates new programs to decrease strain on the grid, like energy efficiency programs.

Amy Heart, senior vice president for policy at the California-based solar company Sunrun, said the bill’s “virtual power plant” program will allow utilities to aggregate resources like residential solar and storage installations and coordinate them.

“The idea of utilizing electrons that are already stored in the batteries that are in houses and businesses — but adding them all up and dispatching them at times we need them the most in Illinois — reduces the amount of energy that ComEd or Ameren has to go to the wholesale market and buy from other states,” Heart said.

Environmental groups also praised the bill, with representatives of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and others saying the policy was a major step in keeping prices low.

“The legislation bolsters tools and programs the state needs to achieve its clean energy goals and rebukes recent federal efforts to undermine abundant, cost-effective wind and solar power,” James Gignac, Midwest policy director for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement.

After a prolonged negotiation, labor groups also signed on to support the bill. They held out full support until lawmakers moved to close a loophole that allowed community solar developers to avoid using project labor agreements. Joe Duffy, head of the labor-affiliated Climate Jobs Illinois, lauded the bill’s passage. He noted that it “ensures the clean energy transition delivers good-paying, local union jobs.”

While affordability was at the center of proponents’ commendations of the policy, it was also central to critics’ attacks. The bill’s energy storage funding mechanism will put a guaranteed increase to Illinois consumers’ utility bills, which sparked significant opposition from Republicans, business groups and some Democrats.

Sen. Willie Preston, a Chicago Democrat, broke with his party as one of three Senate Democrats to vote against the bill. Democratic Senators Michael Hastings, of Frankfort, and Patrick Joyce, of Essex, also voted no.

“This is about standing for integrity, for people who do not have armies of lobbyists down here giving talking points to people to justify raising their bills when they’re already struggling,” Preston said. “I have to vote no.”

Preston had advocated for an alternative funding mechanism — one that used state-backed loans and not an increase to ratepayers — in the months leading up to the bill’s passage.

Groups representing large businesses cited similar concerns. Illinois Industrial Electric Consumers Chair Phillip Golden said the bill’s funding “makes no sense, especially when the same objectives are achievable without forcing more costs on ratepayers.”

Business groups and Republicans also raised concerns over a provision that grants the Illinois Commerce Commission, which regulates utilities, the authority to create long-term “integrated resource plans.” These plans could include goals for the supply of electricity and managing demand.

By giving the ICC that authority, according to critics, the General Assembly is ceding too much authority to the executive branch.

“This is a huge overreach by the governor’s administration,” Sen. Sue Rezin, a Morris Republican, said. “In this bill, he just gave all of the power for energy-making decisions to the ICC — five unelected officials that he appoints.”

Rezin, a longtime advocate for allowing more nuclear construction in the state, said the bill’s elimination of the state’s nuclear moratorium might not mean more nuclear power because of the authority granted to the governor’s appointees.

“Do you think they’re going to bring nuclear online? In the past, they’ve shown they don’t support it,” Rezin said. “They’re going to go towards wind, solar, battery and transmission.”",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=5d8603b0-56dd-5ac7-9338-de2aea9ec21a&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-11-02 01:18:20.699041

The massive 1,500-page package was introduced to parliament on Thursday, after months of meetings between Environment Minister Murray Watt and stakeholders to rewrite reforms that failed to win support last term.

From the beginning, Senator Watt has said that nobody would get everything they wanted — including himself, suggesting that the federal government would be open to amendments in order to see the laws passed.

Speaking on ABC Insiders, Senator Watt said he was ""very confident"" the bill could be passed with the support of either the Coalition or Greens.

""What we're seeking to do here … is achieve a balanced package of reforms,"" he said.

Senator Watt said while the government was not prepared to fully dump the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the government had not made a ""final decision"" on its shape, including whether its CEO could be sacked by a minister — one of the Coalition's asks.

The minister said there was also ""room to move"" to end native forestry's exclusion from the Act, a key demand of the Greens.

This morning, Shadow Environment Minister Angie Bell told Sky News if the legislation remained as it was ""we can't agree to it"".

""We have some grave concerns about the EPBC reforms the government is putting forward,"" Ms Bell said.

""No stakeholders are happy, we're worried about jobs, we're worried about investment and we're certainly worried about productivity.""

Alongside the EPA's leadership, Ms Bell has expressed concerns about definitions requiring a ""net gain"" when remediating environmental damage from a project, changes to an ""unacceptable impact"" clause that could be used to block projects and the removal of emissions reporting requirements.

Ms Bell did not rule out the possibility of a deal being struck this year.

But with an inquiry on the proposed laws set to run until early next year, Ms Bell suggested she would not hurry negotiations.

""He's ramming it through the parliament, at the beginning of the term he was saying he was going to take 12 to 18 months … now suddenly there is a dash to the finish line,"" Ms Bell said.

""Why is he running it through? Because it's got so many holes in it.""

Ministerial power could be used to fast-track critical minerals projects

The environment minister also indicated that intervention powers in the bill could be used to force approvals of critical mineral mining projects.

The government struck an agreement with United States President Donald Trump last month to step up investment in critical minerals, as western nations seek to break dependency on China for those commodities.

That agreement included a stipulation that both nations would take measures ""to accelerate, streamline, or deregulate permitting timelines and processes, including for permits for critical minerals and rare earths mining, separation, and processing"".

The proposed power would allow a minister to override environmental decisions if there was a ""defence or national security"" need, though the bill does not explicitly limit the power's use outside of that.

Senator Watt said critical mineral projects could theoretically be approved under that intervention power.

""That will be obviously up to the minister of the day, and it will require a full environmental assessment for that particular project,"" he said.

""But, yes, under the legislation, if the minister of the day decided that particular project was in the national interest, and a full environmental assessment had occurred to minimise those environmental impacts, if it was still in the national interest to proceed, then the minister would have the ability to approve that.""

The minister also would not rule out that the power could be used to approve a gas project, walking back language on how the power could be used.

Senator Watt told the ABC last week he ""cannot see that happening"" based on how the bill was drafted.

This morning, he said a similar power already existing had been used 27 times in two decades, 17 of which had been in response to natural disasters and recovering near-extinct species.

""So they're the kind of things it's typically used for and I think there are pretty good guide,"" he said.

Senator Watt said he was open to hearing what could be ""tweaked"" in order to see the laws passed.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/11896cd3a4c454ddad2afbdfbbc49f82?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1458&cropW=2592&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-01 23:03:18.539528

Norwegian company Vianode, a global leader in sustainable battery materials, has announced plans to build its first North American facility at Yarmouth Yards in St. Thomas — a multi-billion-dollar investment that marks a major step forward for Canada’s clean energy and critical minerals strategy.

The facility will produce low-emission synthetic graphite, a key component in lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles, grid storage, and defence applications. Vianode’s products will also support nearby manufacturers, including the Volkswagen-backed PowerCo SE battery cell gigafactory, currently under construction.

Amid all of Donald Trump’s haphazard policymaking and chaos-mongering, one part of his agenda has remained remarkably consistent throughout both terms: the quest for something he calls “energy dominance.” While Trump probably thinks he coined the concept, only the name is new; it’s really merely a macho rebranding of what was traditionally known as “energy independence,” the desire to produce the nation’s energy domestically rather than import it from potential adversaries. The yearning for energy independence became a focus back during the Nixon era, when geopolitical tensions sparked overlapping energy crises. Ever since, it’s been pursued by every administration, both Democratic and Republican.

So, yes, even cardigan-wearing, thermostat-adjusting Jimmy Carter was an energy dominance guy, maybe even the most successful one. Same goes for Presidents Obama and Biden. What distinguishes Trump — despite all of his regulatory rollbacks, his “Drill, Baby, Drill” and “Mine, Baby, Mine” and “Beautiful Clean Coal” rhetoric and various “emergency” orders — is that his push for dominance has not only been ineffective, it has actually served to weaken the domestic energy industry and has even diminished its ability to produce the power needed to keep modern society running.

If Trump really cared about energy dominance, independence or abundance, he would use all of the tools at his disposal to “win” this war. Even an energy warrior who didn’t give a hoot about pollution or the climate would insist on keeping the fastest-growing energy sources — wind and solar with battery backup — in the nation’s arsenal, along with nuclear, geothermal, hydropower and natural gas, simply for practical reasons, relying on what previous administrations have called an “all-of-the-above” approach.

Instead, Trump has essentially discarded the most promising and effective energy technologies by eliminating federal tax credits for wind power and both rooftop and utility-scale solar, shuttering new wind projects on federal land and in federal waters, subjecting proposed utility-scale solar on federal land to additional scrutiny and red tape, and canceling the Solar for All program that aimed to bring clean energy and energy self-reliance to lower-income families. More recently, the administration clawed back over $7 billion in Biden-era funding for clean energy and grid-reliability projects, many of which were in Western states and all of which came from states that favored Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 election.

Meanwhile, Trump’s administration is trying to prop up the decrepit and rusty weapons of old, i.e. fossil fuels, and putting them on the front lines in the apparent hope that they don’t crumble away before his term ends.

The administration plans to fork out about $625 million in subsidies in hopes of revitalizing the flagging coal industry and has rolled back myriad regulations (also a form of subsidy) on coal-fired power plants. It has also opened 13 million acres of public land across the West to new coal leasing and overturned Biden-era bans on new leasing in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana. At the same time, it has inexplicably canceled funding for carbon capture projects aimed at prolonging nearby coal plants’ lives.

Trump is clearly not looking to achieve energy dominance, but rather to exercise his countless grievances and realize some historical fantasy — while, of course, helping fossil fuel executives rake in a few more bucks while they still can. It’s a sort of qualified bid for coal and oil dominance, so long as it benefits red-leaning states.

But so far, even that’s not going too well.

Earlier this month, the Bureau of Land Management held its first coal lease sale in over a decade on public land in the Powder River Basin. There was only one would-be buyer, the Navajo Transitional Energy Company, which bid just $186,000 for a tract containing about 167 million tons of coal — meaning about one-tenth of one cent per ton. That’s in contrast to sales in 2012 that brought in over $1 per ton. The feds rejected the bid on the grounds that it didn’t comply with the Mineral Leasing Act since it didn’t fetch fair market value. The Interior Department promptly canceled another sale in the Powder River Basin for 441 million tons of coal just days before it was scheduled to take place. And a third sale, this one on public lands in southwestern Utah, attracted only one low bid as well; and it, too, was rejected.

And just days after the administration announced its plans to pour taxpayers’ cash into the coal industry, PacifiCorp, the largest grid operator in the Western U.S., doubled down on its plans to convert its Naughton coal plant in Wyoming to run on natural gas. Idaho Power actually proposed a rate decrease for its customers after it cut costs by shutting down a unit at a Nevada coal plant. Meanwhile, no utility anywhere has seriously proposed building any new coal plants, mainly because it is simply an obsolete, expensive and dirty technology.

The president’s continual desire to “Drill, Baby, Drill” is experiencing a failure to launch, as well. The BLM has handed out drilling permits like Shriners throwing candy to the crowd at a parade, continuing to do so at an alarming rate despite the government shutdown. During the first six months of Trump’s term, the administration issued 2,660 permits to drill on public lands — about 524 per month. That eclipses Biden’s biggest year of 2023, when he issued 317 per month and garnered the disdain of climate activists.

And yet, drill rig counts, the most accurate indicator of the industry’s enthusiasm and a good barometer of future crude oil and natural gas production levels, have remained stagnant during Trump’s term. In fact, they’re significantly lower than they were a year ago, shortly before Trump was elected. That’s due in part to low oil prices, which is something Trump has pushed for (and maybe prodded Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to encourage by increasing their own oilfield pumping), but also because Trump’s disorderly trade wars are sowing confusion, while his tariffs on steel and aluminum are raising costs for drillers.

The most recent Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey of oil and gas executives revealed how poorly Trump’s policies are playing out in the oilfields. Most of the executives surveyed said that Trump’s regulatory rollbacks and federal royalty reductions would bring down their “break-even” costs only slightly, and that they would not appreciably increase production.

Generally speaking, optimism is in short supply in the oilpatch these days.

“It’s going to be a bleak three-plus years for the oilpatch,” one executive said, in a survey that was designed to be anonymous to encourage a candid response. Another noted: “After Liberation Day, we cut our drilling budget in half from 10 wells to five wells.”

And yet another declared, “We have begun the twilight of shale. Several multibillion-dollar firms that have previously been U.S.-onshore-only are making investments in foreign countries and riskier (waterborne) geologies.” They went on to question what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of abandoned and orphaned wells when the drilling boom ends, noting, “Society will not treat us kindly unless we do our part to clean up after we are gone.”",https://coyotegulch.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/landline-screeshot.png,N,,2025-11-02 01:18:04.683244

President Lai meets European delegates to 2025 Formosa Club Annual Conference

On the afternoon of October 28, President Lai Ching-te met with European delegates to the 2025 Formosa Club Annual Conference and Taiwan-Europe Undersea Cables Security and Cooperation Forum. In remarks, President Lai expressed his appreciation to the guests for promoting pro-Taiwan resolutions in the European Parliament and their respective national parliaments, and for supporting Taiwan’s international participation. The president indicated that this marks the first time the annual conference has been held in Taiwan, and stated that Taiwan is fully committed to collaborating with European and other democratic partners to enhance the security and resilience of undersea cables and other critical infrastructure. He also stated that Taiwan is ready to work with Europe to strengthen the alignment between technology and our values of freedom and democracy through public-private cooperation, so as to jointly establish a new paradigm for democratic partnerships. The president expressed hope to continue working hand in hand to promote global peace, prosperity, and development. A translation of President Lai’s remarks follows: Let me start by warmly welcoming you all to Taiwan. I would also like to thank you for sharing valuable insights and engaging in in-depth exchanges at the conference and forum. The Formosa Club was jointly established in 2019 by the European Parliament-Taiwan Friendship Group and Taiwan friendship groups of the national parliaments of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Its goal is to rally support among like-minded countries for Taiwan’s international participation. This year is especially significant because it marks the first time the Formosa Club Annual Conference has been held in Taiwan. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for your longstanding efforts in promoting pro-Taiwan resolutions in the European Parliament and your respective national parliaments. In particular, the European Parliament has adopted numerous resolutions and statements in its current term that categorically oppose China’s malicious distortion of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and reject any attempts by China to unilaterally change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait by force or coercion. Taiwan has never backed down in the face of expanding authoritarianism. We have always steadfastly upheld the values of democracy and freedom. Your support for Taiwan shows the international community that even under the pressure of authoritarian coercion, we still have like-minded friends who are willing to speak up in the name of friendship and stand for freedom and democracy. This shows the Taiwanese people that democratic partners around the world are working hand in hand with Taiwan to tackle challenges. In recent years, both Taiwan and Europe have faced challenges arising from undersea cable damage or interference. These incidents have reminded us that subsea infrastructure is a lifeline of the global digital economy and a foundation of cybersecurity and economic resilience for democratic nations. At the Taiwan-Europe Undersea Cables Security and Cooperation Forum earlier, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) introduced Taiwan’s RISK Management Initiative on International Undersea Cables. I want to stress that Taiwan is fully committed to collaborating with European and other democratic partners to enhance the security and resilience of undersea cables and other critical infrastructure. We are also ready to work with Europe to strengthen the alignment between technology and our values of freedom and democracy through public-private cooperation, so as to jointly establish a new paradigm for democratic partnerships. In closing, I once again welcome all our guests who have traveled so far to be here. Thank you for showing support for Taiwan through your actions. Let us continue to work hand in hand to promote global peace, prosperity, and development. Rihards Kols, chair of the 2025 Formosa Club Annual Conference and member of the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, then delivered remarks, first thanking President Lai for the warm reception. He noted that hospitality is something that defines Taiwan and its people, and that he believes everyone in attendance has experienced this hospitality. He went on to say that as chair of this year’s annual conference, he sends best regards from Chair Michael Gahler of the Formosa Club in the European Parliament, adding that Chair Gahler reaffirms the work they have concluded in the past two days on both the joint statement and the discussions related to undersea cables, the challenges that face democracies, and how the European Union, Europe, and Taiwan must collaborate in order to tackle these issues. Chair Kols then acknowledged and extended appreciation to Taiwan for its support for Ukraine, as well as for imposing sanctions where necessary to avoid circumvention. The chair then presented the joint statement from the conference, stating that it not only reflects the efforts of the Formosa Club on ongoing issues, but also focuses on enhancing the partnership with Taiwan, be it representation in international arenas or the meaningful representation of Taiwan, adding that this is something they will work on hands-on. He also noted that people-to-people relations is something they keep dear to their hearts and will promote whenever possible. Els Van Hoof, head of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives delegation, then delivered remarks, stating that Taiwan, Belgium, and the members of the Formosa Club share the values of democracy, human rights, and rule of law, making us natural allies in the shared threat of China and Russia. She indicated that the Belgian Parliament has already adopted a resolution against the distortion of UN Resolution 2758, and now will discuss risk management for undersea cables, adding that there has to be cooperation. She expressed hope to continue working together and deepen cooperation on risk management, creating a global shield of democratic resilience. Erin McGreehan, member of the Chamber of Representatives of Ireland and head of the Irish cross-party parliamentary delegation, then delivered remarks. Ireland and Taiwan, she said, are two very proud island nations who believe in self-determination, democracy, human rights, and freedom. She expressed her belief that we must work together in this troubled time of global unrest and conflict to secure all our futures, stating that we will do that only through dialogue, cooperation, acceptance of difference, and ability to embrace new opportunities. She mentioned that for Ireland and Europe, she sees Taiwan as their opportunity, not only to support a democratic country in Asia, but to enhance economic, educational, and cultural ties. She then said that they have much to do and much to look forward to. Thorsten Benner, co-chair of the delegation of European opinion leaders and co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, then delivered remarks. He said that it is a pleasure for him to be in Taiwan for the first time, noting that their group is eager to learn about Taiwan and how they can deal with shared challenges. He then mentioned examples of such challenges, including our aging societies and the younger generations’ feeling of uncertainty about their future prospects. Justyna Szczudlik, co-chair of the delegation of European opinion leaders and deputy head of research at the Polish Institute of International Affairs, then delivered remarks. She said that their delegation is here because they would like to experience democracy in Asia and in Taiwan, where they have felt its vibrancy. Noting that we are living in turbulent times because of many things ongoing in different parts of the world, she said that there is a consensus in Europe – and not only in Europe – that the security of Europe, of Asia, and of the Taiwan Strait are interconnected. She pointed out that it is in our common interest to work together and to focus on security, the most important topic for Europe, Asia, and Taiwan. In closing, she expressed thanks for President Lai’s meeting with them and for the enormous hospitality they have received, adding that they hope to be back next year.

President Lai attends AIPAC dinner event

On the evening of October 27, President Lai Ching-te attended an American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) dinner event. In remarks, President Lai thanked AIPAC for long highlighting the importance of peace across the Taiwan Strait to regional and global peace and prosperity. He also stated that Taiwan, the United States, and Israel may be geographically distant, but are all firmly committed to freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, standing on the frontline against authoritarianism and defending our way of life and fundamental values. The president said that Taiwan will continue to increase military investment and bolster its self-defense capabilities. He expressed hope that Taiwan will make the most of its advantages as a semiconductor industry hub by integrating US and Israeli resources in research and development, and deepen economic and trade collaboration to help achieve regional peace, stability, and prosperity. A transcript of President Lai’s remarks follows: I extend a warm welcome to the first ever delegation to Taiwan from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. AIPAC is a prominent nonprofit, dedicated to advancing US-Israel relations. It is a highly prestigious and influential organization in the United States. I am so pleased to see that AIPAC’s first delegation to Taiwan comprises over 200 people. I would like to thank President [Bernard] Kaminetsky and the delegation for their high regard and support of Taiwan. Let me also recognize Mr. Jeffrey Schwartz, founder of the Jeffrey D. Schwartz Jewish Community Center, for his long-term promotion of exchanges between Taiwan, Israel, and the US Jewish community, and in particular his efforts in facilitating this visit. The delegation includes leaders from politics, business, and other sectors of the United States. Many of you are visiting Taiwan for the first time. Over the past few days, I am sure you have experienced Taiwan’s freedom, diversity, and vibrancy. Taiwan and the United States are steadfast partners that share the values of freedom and democracy. We are delighted that with cross-party support, Taiwan-US-Israel ties continue to deepen. At this important event, I want to take the opportunity to express my relief that the Israeli hostages have been released. Following the Hamas violent attack on October 7, 2023, Taiwan immediately condemned the attack and then provided assistance to the Israeli people through humanitarian aid and medical supplies. The latest ceasefire and release of hostages have been the most significant developments in the past two years. The breakthrough was a major diplomatic achievement for US President Donald Trump and an important step toward peace in the Middle East. I would like to recognize the tireless contributions of AIPAC members to regional peace during this period. Jewish culture has one of the longest histories in the world. In recent centuries, Jewish people have suffered constant persecution. Yet, with persistence and determination, the more than 15 million Jews around the world have become pillars of their respective communities. The Taiwanese people often look to the example of the Jewish people when facing challenges to our international standing and threats to our sovereignty from China. The people of Taiwan have never become discouraged. By working hard, they have made Taiwan an indispensable partner in the global high-tech industry and the development of artificial intelligence. Taiwan is one of the very few countries that holds International Holocaust Remembrance Day events each year with the Israeli and German missions. In recent years, commemorations have been attended by the president. In addition to reminding us of the grave historical significance behind the phrase “never again,” the events also pay tribute to all acts of courage against totalitarianism. Today’s global landscape is in a state of constant flux. Taiwan, the United States, and Israel may be geographically distant, but we are all firmly committed to freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. We stand on the frontline against authoritarianism, defending our way of life and our fundamental values. My friends, appeasement has never been the way to stop authoritarian regimes. Only the concept of peace through strength can overcome all changes and challenges. This is a maxim that the societies of Taiwan, the United States, and Israel have stood by for years. Israel’s determination and capacity to defend its territory provides a valuable model for Taiwan. I have always believed that Taiwan needs to channel the spirit of David against Goliath in standing up to authoritarian coercion. Over the past few years, Taiwan has further bolstered its self-defense capabilities. Next year’s defense budget, as defined by NATO, will exceed 3.32 percent of GDP. We aim to reach 5 percent by 2030. Meanwhile, inspired by Israel’s Iron Dome and the US Golden Dome, Taiwan will build its own T-Dome multilayered air defense system. Looking ahead, Taiwan will continue to increase military investment. This includes building capacity in the indigenous defense industry and procuring necessary weapons and technology from other countries to bolster overall combat capacities. We hope that AIPAC will lend Taiwan even greater support and assistance in this matter. The United States has consistently demonstrated strong bipartisan support for Taiwan. Recently, Taiwan has also increased engagement with the Israeli administration and Knesset (parliament). Last month, I met with a delegation led by Mr. Boaz Toporovsky, chair of the Israel-Taiwan parliamentary friendship group. I was honored to receive a joint statement backing Taiwan’s international participation signed by 72 Knesset members from various political parties. We are very grateful for the demonstration of support from the Knesset, as well as its stance of firm opposition to Beijing’s “one China” framework and distortion of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758. In addition to cooperation on defense, security, and foreign affairs, at this critical juncture in the restructuring of global supply chains, Taiwan, the United States, and Israel should strengthen collaboration in the key areas of trade and investment. Taiwan is well-versed in advanced chip manufacturing and is very willing to enhance cooperation with Israel under President Trump’s AI Action Plan. When I served as mayor of Tainan, I was invited to Israel for the International Mayors Conference. I was deeply impressed by the diversity and resilience of Israel – the innovation nation. I look forward to Taiwan making the most of its advantages as a semiconductor industry hub by integrating US and Israeli resources and experience in research and development. Together, we can deepen collaboration in such fields as semiconductors, ICT, and cybersecurity to jointly expand our global market share and bolster supply chain resilience. In closing, I once again extend a warm welcome to all of you for visiting Taiwan. I hope that the United States, Israel, and other partner countries will continue to highlight the importance of peace across the Taiwan Strait to regional and global peace and prosperity. When you return home, please share your experiences in Taiwan with your friends in all sectors of US society, so that more people can get to know Taiwan and understand what it has to offer. I believe that trilateral Taiwan-US-Israel cooperation can help achieve regional peace, stability, and prosperity.

President Lai delivers 2025 National Day Address

President Lai Ching-te on the morning of October 10 attended the ROC’s 114th Double Tenth National Day Celebration in the plaza fronting the Presidential Office Building, and delivered an address titled “A New Taiwan Rises in a Time of Change.” A translation of the president’s address follows: National Day Celebration Chairperson Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜), Vice President Bi-khim Hsiao, Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰), Her Excellency the Governor-General of Belize Froyla Tzalam and Mr. Daniel Mendez, His Excellency the Governor-General of St. Lucia Errol Charles and First Lady Anysia Charles, President of the Chamber of Deputies of the Republic of Paraguay Raúl Latorre, Japan-ROC Diet Members’ Consultative Council Chairman Furuya Keiji, heads of delegations from diplomatic allies and friendly nations, members of the foreign diplomatic corps in Taiwan, distinguished guests from home and abroad, and my fellow citizens here in person and watching on TV or online: Good morning. Today is the National Day of the Republic of China, and while we gather every year to celebrate the nation’s birthday, this year is an especially significant one. It is a historic year for Taiwan’s democratization. One month ago, September 10, was the historic date when the number of days Taiwan had spent free from martial law officially surpassed the number of days endured under its stifling rule. This signifies that we have parted entirely from an authoritarian regime and its shadow, and have ushered in a democratic future full of hope. We will not forget the blood and tears of those who united to defend against aggression, nor will we forget the selfless sacrifices of past generations in pursuit of democracy and freedom, granting sovereignty to the people. Those stories, which have become woven into the fabric of our land, are our collective memory. Democratic Taiwan, forged through untold hardships, is what most clearly positions the 23 million people of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu in this world. Taiwan is a beacon of democracy in Asia. For every person still living in darkness under authoritarian rule, we forever shine the light of hope. This year also saw Taiwan’s rise. Nations around the world are suffering drastic changes and challenges, and Taiwan is no exception. In addition to the Russia-Ukraine war, turmoil in the Middle East, and China’s continued military expansion, the United States’ tariff policy has delivered a blow to economies and industries alike. But the people of Taiwan are still on their feet. And not only that – this year’s economic performance greatly impressed the global community. According to the Asian Development Bank’s latest report, Taiwan’s economic growth rate this year leapt from 3.3 to 5.1 percent, leading the Four Asian Tigers and surpassing China. Taiwanese exports have continued to reach record highs, and employment is at its best in 25 years. Our stock market has also risen for six consecutive months, hitting an all-time high of 27,301 points. Taiwan’s market capitalization has topped US$3 trillion, making our stock market the world’s eighth largest, and foreign exchange reserves surpassed US$600 billion for the first time, setting a new record. In the midst of adversity, we remain undaunted. In the midst of challenges, we grow ever stronger. These are achievements that the people of Taiwan made together. Let us all celebrate them! These impressive economic accomplishments also reflect the stellar record of Taiwan’s semiconductor, ICT, electronic component, and other leading industries. Their advantageous position in the global supply chain is the result of long-term key policies for the development of technological and manufacturing capabilities, unique business models, and government-led science parks. This is a monumental industrial achievement forged by decades of combined efforts, and it belongs to all the people of Taiwan. As president, it is my mission to protect these valuable assets and use them to boost Taiwan’s and even worldwide industrial and economic growth, helping to create even better lives for people in Taiwan and around the world. This is also the direction Taiwan is taking. Of course, we will certainly not ignore the formidable challenges in this time of global change, and the risks they pose to different industries, different fields, and groups of different backgrounds. Many of the champions, traditional industries, and micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) leading Taiwan’s economic growth from behind the scenes are facing the pressure of the digital and net-zero transition. Many workers feel concerned and uneasy about job opportunities, salaries, commodity prices, and cost of living in the face of the AI wave. Farmers are also being impacted by an aging rural population and market liberalization. The government will not take these challenges lightly, and will not ignore the impact they have on each and every citizen. It is our responsibility to put our full effort into assisting traditional industries, MSMEs, working families, and those in the agricultural and fishing industries. Therefore, in addition to having proposed a 93-billion-NT-dollar tariff impact support plan to help enterprises, workers, and those in the agricultural and fishing industries weather this difficult time, the government will also be investing tens of billions of dollars each year to help MSMEs introduce AI into their work so they can move toward digital and net-zero upgrading and transformation and address challenges. For traditional machine tools, screws and nuts, and other industries that are facing difficulties, we will also be proposing separate countermeasures to actively help boost competitiveness and expand the market. My fellow citizens, times of change are also times of opportunity. Taiwan’s economic performance is clear for all to see, and our key position in the global supply chain can neither be challenged nor replaced. In the face of change, we must not doubt ourselves or waver, but seize opportunities with confidence and bravely follow through. We must not be complacent or turn back, but even more proactively forge ahead in the world. A Taiwan that is certain will serve as an important, reliable, and steady force for an uncertain world. Moving ahead, we will adopt three major strategies in order to ensure the Republic of China Taiwan’s competitive advantage: First, we will expand investment in Taiwan. Our Three Major Programs for Investing in Taiwan have yielded substantial results. Investment has surpassed NT$2.5 trillion, creating over 160,000 job opportunities. In July, the Executive Yuan extended the programs to 2027 while also expanding applicable industries and eligibility to include overseas Taiwanese businesses worldwide and foreign investing enterprises. The government is continuing to optimize the investment environment, adding NT$720 billion in new loans to attract investment in Taiwan and bring in an estimated NT$1.2 trillion in capital and 80,000 more job opportunities. Besides having good work, we should also have good lives. With this in mind, the government launched the Trillion NT Dollar Investment National Development Plan to encourage copious investment of private capital in public infrastructure through innovative public-private partnerships. It expands funding for construction while at the same time promoting critical infrastructure projects across counties and cities nationwide, in areas such as water, electricity, housing, education, healthcare, culture, tourism, and transportation. This will help meet local residents’ needs so they can live happy lives, and enable industries and spheres of living to develop in a complementary way so that we can achieve our goal of a balanced Taiwan. Second, we will deepen international economic and trade cooperation, and expand our global presence. This year, Taiwan and the United Kingdom, under the framework of our Enhanced Trade Partnership arrangement, additionally signed three pillar arrangements in investment, digital trade, and energy and net-zero. This marks a new milestone for Taiwan-UK economic and trade relations, showing our mutual commitment to high international trade standards and laying the foundation for cooperation in technology, advanced manufacturing, and other strategic industries. Moving ahead, Taiwan will sign bilateral economic and trade cooperation agreements with even more friends and allies while upholding the principle of mutual benefits. We will also actively engage in reciprocal tariff negotiations with the US to secure a reasonable rate, resolve the trade deficit between Taiwan and the US, and deepen industrial cooperation. This will enable Taiwan’s economic development to become more globally connected and thereby make great strides. Third, we are building a chain of “guardian mountains” to shore up Taiwan’s industrial capabilities. In this digital age, we will implement 10 new AI infrastructure initiatives. In addition to helping make Taiwan one of the world’s top five computing centers, we will also invest more vigorously in R&D in three key technological fields: quantum technology, silicon photonics, and robotics. This will facilitate the introduction of AI tools in different sectors and professions, and promote the application of AI in various fields, helping Taiwan move toward an era of comprehensive smart technology and continue to maintain its leading position in global tech development. We are also building Taiwan into a hub in Asia for asset management. This will not only help retain trillions in Taiwanese capital, but attract investment in Taiwan with international capital, promoting growth in the financial industry, creating quality job opportunities, and strengthening Taiwan. The biopharmaceutical industry is a key national industry and has thus been included in our National Project of Hope. We are also developing toward greater use of precision health in health maintenance, preventive medicine, diagnosis, treatment, and care, giving our nation durable competitiveness and advancing the well-being of our people. Next year, our National Infectious Diseases Bank will be completed, and Taiwan will continue stepping up its cooperation with other countries in the field of biotechnology. Through our program for investment in smart healthcare innovation and entrepreneurship, with its budget of NT$10 billion, we will encourage more firms to invest in innovative R&D, expand investment, and move the biomedical industry toward becoming a trillion-NT-dollar industry, which will be one more guardian mountain for our nation. My fellow citizens, Taiwan is for all the people of Taiwan. We are well aware that no matter how impressive our economic performance may be, we must not overlook anyone on this land. The fruits of our economic growth should be enjoyed by all our people. Good numbers should translate into good lives, with no one left behind. Helping our citizens stay healthy, nurturing young talent, creating an even better environment for the younger generation, and providing greater support for young families is the government’s absolute responsibility. The Healthy Taiwan Cultivation Plan, launched this year, is improving the medical environment and system overall and will ensure higher quality healthcare services for all citizens. Also this year, we officially established the Ministry of Sports, ushering in a new era of sports for all, competitive sports, and professional sports. With this new ministry, we aim to ensure that all athletes receive full national support so that they can pursue their dreams on the global stage, winning national glory. In addition, to support our young people, we are providing free tuition for high schools and vocational schools, and an NT$35,000 annual tuition subsidy for students of private junior colleges, colleges, and universities. Our Taiwan Global Pathfinders Initiative, which supports young people aged 15 to 30 in pursuing their dreams abroad, is officially underway. Moreover, for renters, the government provides NT$30 billion in annual rent subsidies. Unmarried renters with an annual income below NT$626,000, families of four with a combined annual income below NT$1.641 million, and households with three generations living together with a combined annual income below NT$2.1245 million will be exempt from individual income tax. We will also provide even greater support to the young parents in our society. In addition to promoting version 2.0 of our national childcare policy for ages 0–6, with increased childcare allowances and expanded childcare subsidies, starting next year, the government will provide an increased birth subsidy of NT$100,000 per child. Nor do our senior citizens need to worry. Next year, with the launch of Long-Term Care 3.0, the government will work hard to ensure that all seniors receive more convenient, more comprehensive care. Our goal is to ensure that all to whom the nation belongs – our children, young people, parents, and grandparents – receive better care so that they can face the future with greater confidence. This year also marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The lessons of World War II are still fresh in our memory. The ambitions of the aggressors in that conflict caused widespread devastation and loss of life. In today’s world, authoritarianism continues to expand and the international order faces severe challenges. Regional order in the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, and South China Sea, and even the security of the entire first island chain, are under serious threat. Democratic Taiwan is a crucial link for the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific and a responsible member of the international community. As such, Taiwan will work to uphold the status quo, ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and promote the prosperous development of the region. We look forward to the day when China can take responsibility as a major power and cease its distortion of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and historical World War II documents. We also hope it will renounce the use of force or coercion to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait so that we can jointly maintain the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific. Looking back at World War II, we see that so many experienced the suffering of war and the pain of invasion. We should learn from these lessons and ensure that the tragedies of history are never repeated. The outcomes of that conflict tell us that aggression fails, unity prevails, and that peace is won through strength. I want to declare to our citizens and the international community: At the end of this year, we will be proposing a special budget for national defense. Defense spending, as it is defined by NATO, will exceed 3 percent of GDP next year, and will reach 5 percent of GDP by 2030, showing our determination to safeguard the nation. The increase in defense spending has a purpose; it is a clear necessity to counter enemy threats and a driving force for developing our defense industries. Through our new defense budget, we aim to achieve three major goals: First, we will accelerate our building of the T-Dome, establish a rigorous air defense system in Taiwan with multi-layered defense, high-level detection, and effective interception, and weave a safety net for Taiwan to protect the lives and property of citizens. Second, we will advance the integration of high-tech and AI technologies to build a smart defense combat system, maximizing effective deterrence for our asymmetric strategy. Third, we will continue to invest in innovative defense technologies and collaborate with the military industries of advanced nations to bolster our defense industry capabilities. We will strengthen our domestic supply chains through local R&D, design, and manufacturing. This will enable Taiwan to accelerate industry upgrades, enhance the resilience of our military equipment, and boost the capacity of our defense industry. In that way, Taiwan, becoming a trusted security partner for our friends and allies, can jointly avoid the red supply chain and foster trust in defense among free and democratic countries, while building a robust line of defense to safeguard the values of freedom and democracy. We are determined to maintain peace through strength. We firmly believe that strength is not obtained through military strength alone, but must also rely on resilience throughout society. Over the past year, through the efforts of the Office of the President Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee, we have built up greater strength between the government and private sector, and between the central and local governments. We have integrated disaster prevention and defense to strengthen military-civilian cooperation. We have also continued to strengthen resilience in civilian training, energy, healthcare, information and communications networks, and finance, comprehensively enhancing our ability to respond to various crises. I want to emphasize that building societal defense and resilience requires every ounce of effort. Last month, we released our updated national public safety guide, which includes strategies for responding to various natural disasters and even extreme scenarios such as a military invasion. We plan to gradually ensure that each and every household has access to this safety guide, because only when all of society participates and learns to help themselves and one another can Taiwan develop greater resilience to face all kinds of challenges. My fellow citizens, over the past year, we have faced numerous challenges together, but the people of Taiwan never give up hope. Whenever a crisis arises, we always see numerous Taiwanese standing on the frontline, selflessly dedicating themselves to the nation they love. Just last month we saw two very moving scenes. The first was at the UN General Assembly held in New York, where many members of the overseas Taiwanese community raised money and launched a fundraising campaign to light up Times Square with advertisements to “Chip in with Taiwan,” promoting Taiwan’s participation, and advocating that we are “Better Together.” It touched the hearts of people around the world. The second was the tens of thousands of volunteers who, after the Fata’an Creek barrier lake disaster, slipped on their rain boots, shouldered their shovels, and traveled great distances to provide relief to help the affected residents of Hualien return to normal life as soon as possible. These “superheroes with shovels” did more than dig out heavy mud and sludge to help disaster victims return home; these heroes also uncovered a light – a light of hope that warmed every heart it touched. More than that, they proved the remarkable resilience of the Taiwanese people and their resolve to protect our homeland in the face of crisis. Now, let us all thank these superheroes of disaster relief, who come from all walks of life and from all over the country, as well as friends from abroad and the military, police, firefighters, and central and local government personnel who devoted themselves to the relief effort. This spontaneous nationwide movement is absolutely unique in the world, and for that the world will remember: Taiwan, that small mountainous country, is truly compassionate, and truly great! Moving forward, I will continue to lead the country, hearts united, without fear of hardship or challenge, bravely, toward an even better tomorrow. Let’s keep going, Taiwan! Let’s keep going, Republic of China! Let’s keep going, Republic of China Taiwan! Thank you.",https://english.president.gov.tw/template/assets/img/fbshare.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 23:03:33.152144

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Investment Narrative Recap

To own Mitsubishi Heavy Industries stock, you need confidence in its ability to capture long-term demand for energy transition, advanced manufacturing, and cross-border infrastructure projects. The recent US-Japan cooperation around potential US-based investment projects could strengthen order backlog prospects, but the biggest immediate risk, persistent foreign exchange volatility affecting reported earnings, remains largely unchanged by the announcement, as actual project launches and funding are still uncertain. Among recent announcements, MHI's Q1 fiscal 2025 earnings report saw both revenue and net income rise, supported by continuing strong order intake in energy systems. This growth in core markets may be relevant if US project initiatives advance, as stronger earnings and order momentum could help offset near-term risks from margin pressures or currency swings. But investors should also keep in mind that, despite this promising news, heightened sensitivity to currency movements can unexpectedly...

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is projected to reach ¥6,460.1 billion in revenue and ¥438.4 billion in earnings by 2028. This outlook is based on an annual revenue growth rate of 8.1% and an earnings increase of ¥187.0 billion from the current earnings of ¥251.4 billion.

Vicksburg will once again be home to an Entergy Mississippi power generation source with construction of the Vicksburg Advanced Power Station, the company’s latest investment to replace retired, fifty-year-old natural gas generation facilities with newer, highly efficient resources. The 754-megawatt combined-cycle combustion turbine facility will be located on the grounds of the former Baxter Wilson Steam Electric Station and, along with already-announced plants in Greenville and Ridgeland, will help ensure Entergy Mississippi’s 459,000 customers continue to have efficient, reliable and affordable energy.

Replacing legacy power plants with new, highly efficient power generation sources provides long-term savings to customers. Modern natural gas plants are forty percent more fuel efficient than older facilities, saving customers more money on future bills for decades to come.

In the short term, the construction of this and other new generation units at the time of new large industrial technology customers’ investments in the grid—like Amazon—will reduce forecasted bill increases by sixteen percent over the next five years.

Savings include an estimated $1.3 billion in the materials and equipment costs to build new power plants today, compared to the cost to build those facilities on their original schedules. Given the inflationary trends in materials and construction costs, building facilities now will save customers money.

Entergy’s diverse generation portfolio offers flexibility to lessen the impact on customers’ bills should one fuel source spike in price. Additionally, Entergy expects to pass on to customers an estimated savings of $700 million in fuel costs over the life of the new units.

“Today, we are in a global race to secure leadership in the emerging industries of the future—and one of the most critical ingredients in this race is energy,” said Governor Tate Reeves, who attended the ground breaking. “A top priority of mine will be continuing to bring more available, affordable and reliable energy to our state. Entergy’s massive $1.2 billion investment will help us further solidify Mississippi as a leader in American energy production. This is another historic day for energy and economic development in Mississippi.”

These measures are part of Superpower Mississippi, the largest grid upgrade in the company’s history, which makes distribution improvements, adds new generation and prioritizes keeping customers’ rates affordable while building an all-of-the-above generation mix that makes the electric grid more reliable and efficient.

While electricity costs are rising nationally, growth in our service area—including new large industrial customers like Amazon—means some of the increased costs for equipment and fuel that otherwise would be incorporated into future bills won’t be passed on to our other existing customers. Customers will also share a smaller portion of the costs than they would have to build the same plants on their original schedules.

“Vicksburg is one of the four original cities we began serving in 1923, and we’re proud to continue our legacy here with the Vicksburg Advanced Power Station. We’re building new natural gas plants in our service area for the first time in more than 50 years. Replacing older plants has been in our long-term resource plan for several years, but we’re taking advantage of the economic growth happening in our region to bring modern generation technology online sooner, while minimizing the rate impact to customers’ bills,” said Haley Fisackerly, President and CEO, Entergy Mississippi.

“These upgrades are not only important to keeping bills affordable for customers, but also to making sure we have the capacity to promote economic development, recruit new and higher paying jobs, and power residential, commercial, industrial and technology growth for Mississippi’s future.

“Our reliability effort announced last month combined with this additional commitment to develop new power generation sources means our Superpower Mississippi plan is bringing more power and better power to customers, all at a lower cost to them,” continued Fisackerly. “Our state leaders have been instrumental in recruiting large industrial customers, like Amazon, that afford us the ability to provide these significant benefits to customers. And, thanks to support for that growth from Governor Reeves, the Mississippi State Legislature and the Mississippi Public Service Commission, all customers will benefit from lower bills than they otherwise would have seen in the future. We’re also grateful to local leaders, like those in Warren County, who welcome these investments that not only help their communities prosper but also serve Mississippi families and businesses throughout the western half of the state.”

“I’m encouraged to see Entergy Mississippi moving into the next phase of its Superpower Mississippi plan, with a clear focus on generating power that’s both efficient and affordable,” said De’Keither Stamps, Mississippi Public Service Commissioner, Central District. “As utility costs continue to rise nationwide, it’s important that Mississippians see real savings and reliable service here at home. By working with large industrial customers to share costs and drive new economic growth, Entergy is helping ensure lower rates and stronger reliability for all customers. I look forward to seeing continued progress that keeps Mississippi competitive and our communities well-powered for the future.”

“Entergy’s investment in this new power plant sets a record for capital investment in the City of Vicksburg,” said Willis Thompson, Vicksburg Mayor. “We are excited about our long-term partnership with Entergy and what this project means for the future of our community. The economic impact will be tremendous, and the additional power capacity will further strengthen our ability to attract new jobs and investment to the region.”

A $1.2 billion investment, the Vicksburg Advanced Power Station represents a significant economic impact for the area, including more than 560 construction jobs over the next several years and additional tax revenue for Warren County. Entergy will employ about twenty-one personnel to operate the plant once completed.

This advanced facility will be equipped with combined-cycle combustion turbine technology that primarily uses natural gas and is also designed to support blended hydrogen in the future, mirroring the other power plants Entergy Mississippi is building: Delta Blues Advanced Power Station in Greenville and Traceview Advanced Power Station in Ridgeland. Much like the legacy units that have been cornerstones of our local communities for half a century, these new plants will power life for the next generation of Mississippians and beyond.

“The contribution of Entergy’s newest power plant goes far beyond generating electricity,” said Kelle Barfield, Warren County Board of Supervisors President. “The contribution of Entergy’s newest power plant goes far beyond generating electricity. Reliable, affordable electricity is important to existing customers, but it is crucial in recruiting new business and industry to Warren County.

Get ready for a new line item on electricity bills across Illinois totaling at least $7 billion as the absurdity of Illinois green energy policy continues.

The new charge will be for large batteries that store electricity from wind and solar sources. It’s another cost of green energy nobody told you about. Because wind and solar are not reliable, you will now have to pay to cover up the consequences.

It’s The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (CRGA, Senate Bill 25), passed Friday by the General Assembly. Gov. JB Pritzker says he will sign it.

Among many other controversial provisions, here’s one you should know about:

Part of your electricity bill is something called a “capacity charge” assessed by electricity grid operators, two of which cover Illinois. The capacity charge is an assurance that the grid operator will provide enough electricity to its territory even in periods of peak demand. If the grid operator has less access to reliable sources its capacity charges are higher. Capacity charges have soared recently, which is part of why your electricity bills have risen.

The problem with wind and solar is they don’t produce anything when it’s dark and windless. Grid operators therefore cannot give as much credit to wind and solar when they set capacity prices as they can to more reliable sources like natural gas, coal and nuclear. Wind and solar now provide around 20% of Illinois electricity and rising, though estimates vary somewhat. Up went your electricity bill as that portion has risen, thanks to green mandates in Illinois law.

What to do about those higher electricity costs from unreliable sources?

Just add batteries, says our political establishment, and voila, problem solved. Big batteries connected to the grid can store electricity from wind and solar, they say. Their claim is that when the new line item for batteries starts appearing on your bill in 2030 it will be offset by a reduction at least as big in the capacity charge reflected in the rest of your bill.

Think about that. They are making you pay to solve the very problem their green energy mandates caused, which is higher prices. Had we stuck with reliable traditional sources we wouldn’t be trying to deal with the upward pressure on capacity charges caused by renewables.

And who has any confidence that $7 billion of batteries will be the end of it?

Not the authors of the new law, apparently. The battery assessment charge amounts on your bill will be left entirely to the Illinois Commerce Commission – unelected officials. And the law contains no caps. The original law mandating Illinois’ conversion to renewable energy contained caps on rate increases – weak caps, but at least they were something. The new law has nothing. Other estimates already put the charge for the new law at $8 billion, not $7 billion over 20 years.

Perhaps most astonishingly, the bill is being spun by its supporters as a measure to reduce electricity bills. They’ve in fact just swapped one charge in your bill for another.

*******************

This initial article just begins to touch on the madness of the new CRGA law. It’s a monstrosity, and we will try to address the rest of it in later columns. Among its other provisions:

It provides for another $1,687,403 annually for the Clean Jobs Workforce Network program; another $1,687,403 million annually for the Clean Energy Contractor Incubator program; and an additional $1,143,079 million annually for the Barrier Reduction Program beginning June 2026.

It requires the Illinois Department of Commerce to transfer up to $84,800,000 annually from the Energy Transition Assistance Fund to the Electric Vehicle and Charging Fund – more subsidies for charging stations.

And, of course, there’s more bureaucracy:

Thermal Energy Network Pilot Program to run $20 million for thermal network projects.

Geothermal Homes and Businesses Program that allocates $10 million per year in credits for installation of new geothermal heating and cooling systems.

“Powering Up Illinois” program that mandates faster utility connections for EV infrastructure and establishes performance standards.

In Q3 2025, PowerUp America placed orders for Kempower’s distributed DC fast-charging systems, and according to the company, the first units are already off the manufacturing floor.

The first site in Manchester, Kentucky, will be equipped with two 400-kW power electronics cabinets, each with two satellite dispensers for a total of four stalls. The maximum power output is 400 kW (it decreases accordingly to the power demand at other bays).

The satellite dispensers are equipped with two connectors — one CCS1 and one NACS (SAE J3400) — for maximum compatibility, eliminating the need for adapters.

Depending on the demand, the site has space for additional stalls and additional power.

Regarding payments, a credit card reader will be available. An alternative option is to pay through an app.

The Senate Finance Committee recommended passage Tuesday of Senate File 506, the annual Legislative Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR) appropriation from the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund, voting 10–2 to send the bill to the floor.

The bill would authorize $103,326,000 for 124 environmental and natural-resources projects across Minnesota, the package the LCCMR developed through a multistage review process. A technical A1 amendment to change a grant recipient from Bay West LLC to Freshwater Society was approved in committee. A separate A2 amendment offered by Senator Nick Jasinski to reallocate $335,000 and extend three Southern Minnesota water-quality projects failed 6–6 on a roll call.

Why it matters: the ENRTF is a constitutionally created, voter-approved permanent fund that supplies a large share of state-dedicated funding for conservation, restoration, research, education, land acquisition and related work. LCCMR’s recommendations are the principal vehicle that channels annual ENRTF appropriations to projects the commission selects after competitive review and peer evaluation.

Becca Nash, director of the Legislative Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources, told the committee the package reflects the commission’s process and priorities. ""The bill includes over 103 millions in funding for 124 environmental and natural resources projects across our state,"" she said, and walked members through the bill’s subdivisions that group appropriations by priority area.

The bill allocates funding across multiple subdivisions: $22,084,000 for foundational data and information (36 appropriations); $11,812,000 for water resources (23 appropriations); $11,965,000 for environmental education (19 appropriations); $6,713,000 for invasive species (2 appropriations); $11,744,000 for air quality, climate, and renewable energy (7 appropriations); $12,188,000 for methods to protect or restore land and habitat (19 appropriations); $19,553,000 for land acquisition, habitat, and recreation (14 appropriations); and $7,267,000 for administration, emerging issues and contract reimbursement (4 appropriations). Nash said the commission received 214 proposals requesting roughly $183 million and approved 124 projects following presentations, scoring and external peer review.

Committee members pressed staff on two recurring themes: (1) carryforwards and deadline extensions for previously approved projects and (2) the share of funding that goes to universities and state agencies. Fiscal staff and Nash said many carryforwards stem from COVID-related delays, supply-chain and hiring challenges, or weather impacts; most extensions are for one year, a few for two. Senator Brett (transcript) observed the committee was identifying roughly $9.1 million of extensions across about 13 projects and urged stronger grantee accountability.

A technical A1 amendment, moved by Senator Eichorn and described by staff as a project partner request, replaced the designated lead grantee from Bay West LLC with the Freshwater Society; the committee approved the amendment by voice vote. LCCMR staff explained Freshwater Society is a nonprofit that has previously received ENRTF funding and that the change reflected partner arrangements where a nonprofit serves as the lead and a for‑profit contractor remains as a consultant.

Senator Nick Jasinski offered Amendment A2 to reduce by $335,000 a northern toxic-bloom project and instead extend three Southern Minnesota water-quality projects (Fergus Falls/Lake Alice, Rice County/French Lake and a new Blue Earth County/North Eagle Lake project) for two years. Jasinski described the work as an in‑water, equipment‑based pilot: ""This is an actual project. It's not a study. This is actual equipment in the water that's working right now."" Dan Mueller, fiscal analyst, told the committee two of the three projects previously received 2023 general fund appropriations and that the amendment would effectively double the funding on those items.

Committee debate on A2 reflected differences about process and regional priorities. Supporters argued the pilot is showing measurable benefits and merited additional, short-term funding. Opponents, including several members who said they serve on or rely on the LCCMR process, urged deferring changes to the commission or the environment committee so the vetted package would remain intact. On a roll-call vote the amendment was tied 6–6 and did not prevail.

After discussion the committee approved the bill as presented. Senator Pappas moved that Senate File 506 be recommended to pass; the roll-call vote was 10 ayes, 2 noes. The committee record shows the LCCMR package includes carryforwards and technical changes in sections that do not add new money but adjust timing or recipients for prior appropriations.

What the committee did not decide: the bill before Finance excludes the new community grants program funded by an increase in the constitutionally allowed ENRTF drawdown from 5.5% to 7% (a constitutional change voters approved in November 2024); Nash told members that community grants funds are separate and are administered by the Department of Natural Resources. Several senators asked for follow-up briefings or meetings with grantees—particularly University of Minnesota researchers—about specific projects and their outputs.

Votes at a glance:

- A1 (technical): change lead grantee from Bay West LLC to Freshwater Society; mover: Senator Eichorn; outcome: approved by voice vote; note: described as a project-partner request.

- A2 (Jasinski): reallocate $335,000 to extend three Southern Minnesota water-quality projects; mover: Senator Jasinski; outcome: failed on roll call, 6 yes (Friends, Pratt, Dames, Draheim, Eichhorn, Jasinski) — 6 no (Marty, Champion, Mohammed, Murphy, Pappas, Wicklund).

While it is important to stay informed about the problems in the environment, it is just as important to acknowledge what IS going well.

To flip the script for a minute, let’s look at some happy news in the world of the environment.

Global solar efforts are on the rise … up 64% since last year

Even as the United States shifts away from renewable energy, solar installations are up 64% globally. China has spearheaded this effort, alongside India and much of Africa, as solar has become a more appealing option amidst a “volatile fossil fuel market.”

Urine might save the world

Urine is now being examined as a potential eco-friendly alternative to hydrogen production, which is typically achieved through gas reforming, which releases large amounts of carbon. Alternatively, urine is readily available, and research shows that bacteria can be used to convert compounds in urine into hydrogen without emitting any pollutants. This process has the potential to generate energy that can be used to power cars and homes, while also providing a solution to waste disposal.

Hozier is even cooler than we thought; how he incorporates nature into his music

In May, Andrew Hozier-Byrne, who performs as Hozier released a 10th anniversary version of his “Like Real People Do,” with a few changes. It features nature sounds, including birds, water, insects and thunder. He celebrates music with nature and for nature, as he pledged 50% of all the royalties to be donated to global conservation efforts. This is part of a larger movement called “Sounds Right,” organized by the Museum for the United Nations: UN Live. Other artists involved in this movement include Ellie Goulding, Aurora, Tom Walker, Brian Eno and the estate of David Bowie.

Hollywood hits aside, if Warren Buffett has difficulty making money in airline stocks -- he's taken losses in the industry on two separate occasions -- best believe that this segment isn't giving away ""easy money."" Of course, it pays to remember that Gekko is a fictional character and even the greatest investors, including Buffett, don't bat a thousand.

Add it all up and it might sound as though the best course of action is to avoid stocks like American Airlines (AAL +2.74%), but this Texas-based carrier has recently been gaining altitude and its ascent may be far from over.

American has flown through the darkest clouds

As of Monday, Oct. 27, shares of American are off 23.08% year to date, as of this writing. That's not a data point that screams ""please invest here,"" but understanding the 2025 disappointments delivered by legacy carriers is easy. A lot of the gloominess boils down to trade tariffs.

Those levies hammered airline stocks, including American, on multiple fronts. With some of the targets of President Donald Trump's tariff gambit, such as Canada and Mexico, being important sources of arrivals to the U.S., international business and leisure travel to this country has faltered. Not surprisingly, domestic trade policy has drawn rebuke from the airline industry.

The tariffs also raised costs for American and its airline peers. Some countries at which the U.S. has aimed tariffs have retaliated or simply boosted prices of certain goods purchased by domestic companies. That's relevant in discussing American Airlines because two of its aircraft suppliers, Airbus and Embraer, are foreign companies, and even though Boeing jets are assembled in the States, up to half of the components in some of those aircraft are sourced overseas.

Fortunately, we're more than six months removed from ""Liberation Day"" and American is on the path to redemption. The stock is higher by 18.57% over the past month amid what many investors may perceive as another set of trying circumstances.

What government shutdown?

The current government shutdown could become the longest in U.S. history shjould it continue much longer and it'd be reasonable to think it's a major headwind to airlines. After all, carriers are dependent on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for details such as landings and takeoffs.

Obviously, American's recent stock performance paints a different picture and history confirms a nonworking government isn't always a drag on airline stocks.

American is alluring as a long-haul investment

In the airline biz, a lengthy flight is called a ""long haul."" Investors may want to apply that perspective to American Airlines, but with the caveat that airline investing isn't always a smooth flight. Still, it shouldn't be ignored that management is bullish. CEO Robert Isom believes his company offers more upside than at least two of American's biggest competitors.

The wider industry outlook could also prove supportive of American shares. By some estimates, the total global airline fleet will double in size by 2044 driven by growing middle classes in international markets. That could stoke demand for more international/long-haul travel, the more profitable routes for carriers like American.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/839972/aal.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 21:03:09.948094

As long as Democrats dominate, it’s hard to see New York having reliable electric power much longer, and just forget about it being affordable.","Some Democrats in the Albany may be starting to see the insanity of New York’s “climate action” laws — but will enough agree to even delay the suicide pact?

Gov. Kathy Hochul says she wants to “review all our options,” including making changes to the state’s disastrous 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act — which set budget-busting, pie-in-the-sky mandates to slash greenhouse-gas emissions.

Plus, some Assembly Democrats who once denied Hochul was banning gas stoves now admit that’s just what she’s doing — and demand she delay the ban.

Yet it’ll be tough to convince the progressives who dominate the Legislature to roll back the law, since global-warming hysteria remains the rule on the left, especially among the donor class and other college-educated whites.

Watch New Jersey, where voter fury over soaring electric costs may send Jack Ciattarelli to the governor’s mansion; even a close race there will open eyes in Albany.

Rising utility bills and the threat of blackouts are already becoming major issues in New York, and Hochul plans to make “affordability” the centerpiece of her 2026 reelection campaign.

“My job is to ensure we have enough power to keep the lights on, keep rates affordable and attract major economic development projects,” the gov griped after a judge last month ordered her Department of Environmental Conservation to issue rules to ensure the state meets the 2019 law’s emissions goals.

Meaning: She wants to override (or ignore: see below) the clear letter of the law, even if she doesn’t dare go so far as to call out these statutes’ stupidity.

“We plan to review all our options, including working with the Legislature to modify the CLCPA,” in order “to protect New Yorkers from higher costs.”

Under the law, New York must cut CO2 output by 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050.

On the other hand, the law ordered that rules to achieve those goals be enacted by Jan. 1, 2024 — yet here we are nearly two years later, and they have yet to materialize.

(Yep: Hochul’s ignoring the law!)

Meanwhile, Assemblyman William Conrad (D-W.NY) reports the state’s no-gas mandate, which kicks in at the end of this year, has already hiked construction costs, threatening affordable-housing projects and raising the specter of winter blackouts.

Worse, the state Climate Action Plan mandates closing natural-gas power plants and replacing them with pricier, less reliable solar and offshore-wind installations (which are often failing to get off the ground).

Indeed: The New York Independent System Operator (which runs the electric grid) and even the New York Affordable Clean Power Alliance, a solar-industry group, warn that shifting to solar and wind poses dire threats to reliable power, particularly in the Hudson Valley, Long Island and the Big Apple.

How will Hochul prevent blackouts and keep costs down for New Yorkers when the power supply runs short? Especially, as the NYSIO points out, with growing electric demands from cryptocurrency, data mining and all the “green” mandates to shift to electric heat, cooking and cars?

The idea that New York can even build enough solar- and wind-power generation in time to meet those mandates was always fantasy, a charade to please climate activists — yet it’s what the law says the state must do.

As the legal deadlines get closer (or pass without the state doing what the law says it should), the truth grows ever more obvious: It’s not just unrealistic to make “net-zero carbon emissions” a top priority, it’s also expensive, risky and wrongheaded.

How many court orders can the governor defy?

Can she get the Legislature to change the laws and get the courts off her back?

Alas, pols like Hochul may only care about timing: The 2026 gas mandates kick in just as their reelection campaigns begin.

“Don’t bring things to a grinding halt,” suggests Assemblyman John McDonald (D-Rensselaer), just “slow down a little bit and put a temporary pause in there.”

Translation: Wait until after we’re safely reelected before socking New Yorkers with higher bills and blackouts.

Don’t forget how Hochul delayed congestion pricing until after the 2024 elections.

Yet reality won’t change after the election.

Albany should ditch the mandates completely and focus on economic growth.

Yet Hochul will only seek delays, and the progs may well not go along even that far; forget about doing what New York really needs, like opening the state to fracking.

Hope for Ohio’s Future While state and federal politics can be divisive, PCFO shows that clean energy can unite communities.","Across Ohio, cities and towns are taking the lead in shaping a cleaner, stronger future. Mayors and other local leaders from rural, suburban, and urban communities are proving that investing in clean energy isn’t just good for the environment—it’s smart economics.

That’s the driving idea behind Power A Clean Future Ohio (PCFO), a group helping communities work together to reduce pollution, grow local jobs, and build resilience for the long term.

“Power A Clean Future Ohio represents 50 communities all across our state, from small villages up to our largest cities and counties, and everywhere in between. It represents rural and conservative suburban communities, communities led by Republicans and Democrats alike,” said executive director Joe Flarida. “They have seen the opportunity that the clean energy economy presents for their residents and for their workers, and they know it’s smart to invest.”

A Local Response to a Statewide Challenge

PCFO was born out of frustration—and hope. In 2019, Ohio saw one of the biggest corruption scandals in its history when $60 million in bribes helped pass House Bill 6, a bill that bailed out coal and nuclear plants while rolling back renewable energy and efficiency programs.

Instead of giving up, local advocates and mayors across Ohio came together and said: We can do better. That same year, they launched Power A Clean Future Ohio with a simple mission—empower local governments to take control of their energy future.

Five years later, that mission has grown into a statewide movement. PCFO now represents over 50 communities, from rural towns and counties to large urban centers like Columbus, Dayton, and Toledo.

Local Leaders, Real Results

Ohio’s mayors are showing that clean energy works for everyone.

Mayor Aftab Pureval of Cincinnati puts it simply: “When you’re a local leader, you can’t spin, you can’t obfuscate. You have to lead… That’s why cities are really the perfect venue for climate action. Because we are big enough to have a really big impact on the issue, but we’re small enough in order to be nimble and flexible and address the ever-changing landscape.”

In Toledo, Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz says embracing clean technology is part of the city’s industrial DNA. “We’re still going to create jobs, we’re still going to win those awards for economic development,” he says, “but we’re going to be doing it with an eye toward sustainability.”

For Dayton Mayor Jeffrey J. Mims, Jr., collaboration is key, rather than going it alone: “It makes a whole lot more sense to collaborate with other cities,” he points out, “to move us more quickly to trying to be more of a sustainable city, more of a sustainable state.”

And in Lebanon, Mayor Mark Messer points out a direct benefit to residents: “One of the main benefits with solar is that we’re able to take all of our rate savings and pass them directly on to our rate payers.”

The Power of Pragmatism

PCFO’s success lies in its practical, community-first approach. Every city’s needs are different, so the organization helps local governments create plans that are achievable, measurable, and affordable. They connect cities with technical assistance, funding opportunities, and peer networks—so that progress isn’t limited to political party or geography.

“These efforts unite people because they deliver tangible benefits: lower energy costs, healthier neighborhoods, and new opportunities for small businesses,” said Michael Roberts, senior program officer for McKnight’s Midwest Climate & Energy program. “Power a Clean Future Ohio shows what’s possible when communities come together around shared values of economic vitality and local resilience so their residents have a direct stake in building a more prosperous future. When we invest in clean energy locally, we invest in the economic and civic strength of Ohio.”

According to PCFO’s Executive Director, Joe Flarida, even when there are barriers at the state or federal level, local leaders are proving that Ohio can keep moving forward. “This work continues because it matters to Ohioans—they want clean air, good jobs, and a healthy future.”

Clean Energy Means Good Jobs and Healthy Communities

Clean energy isn’t just about cutting pollution—it’s a growing economic powerhouse. In 2024, clean energy and clean vehicle jobs in Ohio reached more than 121,000, growing much faster than the state’s overall economy.

Those jobs are in everything from installing solar panels, wind turbines, and heat pumps to manufacturing electric vehicles and efficient appliances. They’re helping to keep young workers in the state and making communities more competitive for new business investment.

On top of economic benefits, local clean energy projects are making Ohio healthier. Cities, towns and counties are working on community-driven projects that reduce pollution while improving quality of life—especially for those most affected by unhealthy air and rising energy costs. From electric vehicle programs to energy waste reduction and from renewable electricity to sustainable land use, PCFO supports projects that create cleaner air, lower bills, and create safer neighborhoods for all Ohioans.

Hope for Ohio’s Future

While state and federal politics can be divisive, PCFO shows that clean energy can unite communities. Local leaders of all political stripes agree that investing in clean power makes sense for jobs, for public health, and for the next generation.

As Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther puts it, “We know that Ohio’s economy runs through Ohio cities, so the impact that mayors and local leaders can have in fighting climate change and building more resilient communities—the power’s in our hands, we just have to take it.”

PCFO’s growing network of communities is living proof that real progress doesn’t always start at the top—it starts at home, with leaders willing to act. “We are inspired by the ever-growing momentum of local leaders in Ohio choosing to take action to advance affordable, clean energy and resilience,” said John Mitterholzer, program director for Climate and Environmental Justice at the George Gund Foundation. “The work PCFO does is critical and indispensable. It’s a national model for how cities can collaborate and have an enormous impact with the right kind of support.”

Nearly half of all Ohioans now live in a PCFO member community, a fact that has Flarida feeling optimistic about the state’s progress. “The clean energy economy is here to stay,” says Flarida. “Ohioans understand what’s at stake. Together, we’re building a brighter, cleaner future for everyone.”",https://www.mcknight.org/wp-content/uploads/pcfo-toledo-solar-tour.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 23:03:13.960438

In the neighbouring seat of Bennelong, Labor's Jerome Laxale said the feedback in his community was the need to change environment laws.
But Greens' environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young has argued Labor's laws were an attempt to win over the Coalition, rather than the environmental party.
A Greens insider said Labor ""can't act surprised"" the party and environment groups did not want to ""weaken"" protections for nature.
Other groups like the Lock the Gate Alliance have also launched campaigns online critical of Labor's proposal.","Labor is conducting a widespread ground campaign in support of its environment laws focused on key inner-city seats where both the Greens and Coalition will be in search of votes next election.

Resources have been developed for caucus members to raise awareness of the Albanese government's proposal to overhaul the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in hopes of either spurring ""good faith"" negotiations, or casting their political opponents as a ""blockers"" of sound reforms.

Following a similar blueprint to last term where the Greens were painted as ""wreckers"" for refusing to back an earlier iteration of a proposal to establish a national Environment Protection Agency (EPA), and delaying the Housing Australia Future Fund, Labor insiders believe their tactics will pay electoral dividends in 2028.

But the Greens remain unfazed, casting Labor's move as a desperate play to disguise that its laws ""weaken"" environmental protections.

As part of the campaign, Labor has launched an ""EPA now"" website where Australians can fill out a quick form to send their local senator an email urging them to back the environment reforms, with more than 5,000 people doing so already.

The party also held one of its biggest ever online branch meetings, which was attended by more than 800 members online.

While more than 20 backbench MPs from around the country are participating in a campaign to get the government's message out to voters in must-hold electorates in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.

In the Brisbane seat of Griffith, Labor MP Renee Coffey has been doorknocking and holding mobile offices.

""We need modern environment laws — with an independent EPA — to hold corporations to account, stop further habitat destruction, and make it is easier to sustainably build new homes and generate cheaper electricity,"" she said.

""All of that is at risk if the Greens don't negotiate in good faith with the government, support this reform and work with us to create environmental laws fit for our time.""

Ms Coffey's high-profile defeat of Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather at the 2025 election has been attributed in part to community unhappiness with the minor party blocking or delaying Labor's reforms last term.

Reid MP Sally Sitou has been taking meetings with her Sydney community and hosted a Webinar attended by Environment Minister Murray Watt.

""There is an overwhelming recognition that the current laws aren't working,"" she said.

""The community wants us to be ambitious and wants us to get these reforms through.""

In the neighbouring seat of Bennelong, Labor's Jerome Laxale said the feedback in his community was the need to change environment laws.

""At street stalls and community events that I've held, even the most environmentally conscious community members are not taking the Greens' position that the status quo is better than the new laws,"" he said.

""People want the reforms to be as strong as possible, but at the end of the day they want us to pass them.

""That's a message the Greens could listen to.""

Assistant Climate Change and Energy Minister Josh Wilson said there was strong interest in his community in the changes, rejecting the idea Western Australians were disinterested in protecting the environment.

Mr Wilson said the current proposal delivered ""big positive changes,"" like increasing penalties, compliance and improving national standards to benefit the environment.

""That doesn't mean we can't have a conversation about where it can be improved further. Let's have that conversation, but let's have it in good faith,"" he said.

""If the starting point isn't that what's been put forward isn't already a momentous improvement to existing laws, that's a position I struggle to understand.""

But Greens' environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young has argued Labor's laws were an attempt to win over the Coalition, rather than the environmental party.

""If this was a package that was designed with us as the preferred partner, they'd be closing the loopholes and protecting the environment,"" she said earlier this week.

A Greens insider said Labor ""can't act surprised"" the party and environment groups did not want to ""weaken"" protections for nature.

""Labor thought they could sneak past new laws that fast track coal and gas mines, and they're on the defensive now. Watt's been caught out,"" they said.

They pointed to the criticism of the Australian Conservation Foundation, which has been vocal on social media with posts insisting the proposed reforms ""can't be the ones that become law"".

Other groups like the Lock the Gate Alliance have also launched campaigns online critical of Labor's proposal.

Mr Watt said, once established, Australia's first national EPA would be a ""landmark moment"" for the country and something the community had been calling for over the past decade.

""It's time to get this done,"" he said.

""When I've been out talking to people about these reforms, what I've heard more than anything else is that Australians want the environment protected for future generations to enjoy.""

Mr Watt said it was up to the Greens and Coalition to decide if they wanted to support the important work, or ""block it from happening as they have before"".",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/db542573af6ff0b3dd26026d6abbc0e3?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=4860&cropW=8641&xPos=0&yPos=451&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-01 19:59:10.027506

While the two natural gas units are being built, the Cayuga coal plants, which are nearly 60 years old, could be operational.
Angeline Protogere, a spokesperson for Duke Energy Indiana, said the financing will ultimately save customers more than $812 million over the new plant’s lifetime.
Protegere said a condition of the settlement is that it will not affect the operation of the natural gas units, the cost or the schedule.
“There’s an enormous amount of emissions related to the extraction, the transportation, the storage, the combustion of natural gas,” Olson said, “so let’s not kid ourselves.","Duke Energy ratepayers will see an increase in their monthly bill starting next year after the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on Wednesday approved a $3.3 billion plan by Duke Energy Indiana to replace its two coal-powered units at the Cayuga Generating Station with natural gas units, an effort the utility company maintains is necessary to meet growing energy demands.

The ruling was the result of a months-long battle at IURC public hearings between Duke and opponents who expressed concern about the environmental and financial effects of Duke’s proposal, which will commission a feasibility study examining whether the coal plants should be sold to a third party and kept running.

Under the IURC’s ruling — and Indiana state statute — Duke will receive clean energy incentives as the company builds the new natural gas units.

A 2023 law allows utility companies to use what is known as “Construction Work in Progress” to charge customers for natural gas projects gradually while the project is still being built. The measure is meant to avoid sudden rate increases upon the project’s completion, but also reduces financing costs for utility companies. While the two natural gas units are being built, the Cayuga coal plants, which are nearly 60 years old, could be operational.

Angeline Protogere, a spokesperson for Duke Energy Indiana, said the financing will ultimately save customers more than $812 million over the new plant’s lifetime. But consumer advocacy groups predict customers could see increases of at least $20 per month by 2031, when the two gas units are complete.

Combined with orders from national and state leadership prioritizing coal for energy production, the approval means the public ultimately loses, said Kerwin Olson, executive director Citizens Action Coalition, which intervened in the case. “We are extremely disappointed in this order,” Olson said. “This order from the commission only stands to exacerbate the affordability crisis that faces your consumers today. Duke pretty much got everything they asked for.”

MEETING THE ENERGY DEMAND

The Cayuga Station, located in Vermillion County, first went into service in 1970 and is the oldest coal-fired plant in Duke’s Indiana network.

With a current capacity of around 1,000 megawatts, Protogere said the two natural gas units will add 470 megawatts more for a total capacity of 1,470, a necessary expansion given the units’ age and limits as they approach retirement in 2029 and 2030. Since the last major power plant was added to the Hoosier system in 2013, Protogere said, Duke has acquired about 126,000 new customers.

“That includes everything from homes to small businesses to manufacturers and industries,” Protogere said. “So we will now be able to increase the amount of power generation there on site at Cayuga to meet the rising demand.”

On top of adding new customers, utility companies around the nation are grappling with how to meet energy demands as artificial intelligence data centers continue to boom, making it difficult to predict how much power they will need to ensure reliability in their service areas.

The Cayuga plan is just one way Duke is responding to the demand for more energy. According to a September filing with the IURC, Duke purchased 470 megawatts of additional capacity to serve customers ahead of summer 2025, and the company is projected to come close to falling below requirements in 2030.

“We are seeing growth in our system since 2013,” Protogere said, “and we have an obligation to meet that increased demand for power.”

President Donald Trump in April also issued an executive order to support and increase coal production across the nation, a sentiment that Indiana Gov. Mike Braun shared in an executive order of his own directing Indiana to consider extending the life of every coal plant in the state.

The regulatory approval includes a settlement with Reliable Energy, Inc., an Indiana-based trade association representing the state’s major coal producers, for the study that could transfer operation of the Cayuga units to an outside party. When Duke initially filed its proposal in June, REI opposed, but later agreed to support Duke’s request to build the power plants in exchange for the study, which must be completed within eight months.

“Duke Energy’s exploration of selling its coal units to an independent third party represents a significant step toward Gov. Braun’s vision of ensuring reliable, affordable energy, preserving valuable in-state generation, and strengthening Indiana’s power supply,” REI President Savannah Kerstiens wrote in a statement.

“As power demand continues to rise, a central goal of this vision is to position Indiana as an energy exporter rather than an importer — a milestone that can be achieved by keeping every megawatt of capacity online.”

The filing details required elements of the study, a request for proposals and bidding and a negotiations and due diligence period. Protegere said a condition of the settlement is that it will not affect the operation of the natural gas units, the cost or the schedule. Duke will wait to proceed on demolition of the coal plants during the request for proposals process, and will not close them before 2029.

DECISION UNFAIR TO RATEPAYERS, GROUPS SAY

Several environmental and customer advocacy groups have strongly opposed Duke’s proposal since June. Two public field hearings were held in April in Bloomington and Terre Haute, where advocates like Olson of the Citizen’s Action Committee and nonprofit Vote Solar expressed frustration and filed testimony, leaving the IURC with final say.

The Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, which represents the interests of utility customers, recommended against the plan in May, citing affordability concerns, ever-changing environmental regulations and technological advancements, according to testimony documents. The OUCC suggested alternatives, like continuing to operate the Cayuga coal units or refueling them with natural gas.

“After the IURC issues an order, the OUCC begins extensive legal and technical review,” OUCC Director of External Affairs Olivia Rivera told the News and Tribune in an email. “The order is 80 pages, and our staff has begun the review process, which will take time. I can not offer additional information or comment at this time as I must allow staff to continue their review.”

Protogere of Duke said the rate increase will hit consumers in six-month increments over the construction of the natural gas units, helping smooth out the rate impact so the plant is paid for over many years.

“Rather acquiring the required [power] then, than investing and incurring interest charges that are then compounding,” she said. “By paying as you go, you reduce those financing charges.”

Olson said customers have already seen significant increases in monthly electric bills year over year, citing the $395 million increase requested by Duke and approved by the IURC in January. With people already struggling to get by on a daily basis in today’s economy, Olson said, Wednesday’s decision will shift the risks of the facility’s construction onto people who cannot afford it.

“What ratepayers will see are periodic filings from Duke Energy where they will be seeking cost recovery for expenses recurred to date,” Olson said. “Initially, customers will see a small bill impact – 50 cents, a dollar.”

But those costs will grow over time as construction continues, he said, and ratepayers could see bills go up $20 or more. Protegere said she could not give a specific estimate as to what the first six-month increase might be, but said Duke predicts a 5.4% overall increase during construction years.

What’s more, Olson said, is that natural gas is not as environmentally-friendly as utility companies tout. While natural gas does emit a lower level of carbon dioxide, it still, like coal plants, creates pollution that contributes to global warming. Olson said he thinks oil, gas and utility industries are “very good at PR” advertising natural gas as clean when it isn’t.

“There’s an enormous amount of emissions related to the extraction, the transportation, the storage, the combustion of natural gas,” Olson said, “so let’s not kid ourselves. While it may have fewer emissions than coal, it has emissions that are harmful to public health and our environment and have a negative impact on the climate crisis.”

He said cleaner and cheaper alternatives exist in the way of wind and solar energy, and the CAC filed testimony with a “no-regrets” strategy emphasizing the value of clean energy options that would lead to better outcomes for customers and society.

“What we see is an emphasis on wealth creation for the few at the expense of the many,” he said. “We can have our disagreements over what resources we should be using to power the grid, but there should be no disagreement about who can afford to pay for this stuff and finance this stuff, and it is certainly not your everyday, average Hoosier.”

That being said, the IURC’s ruling was given on the basis Duke’s proposal satisfied Indiana’s required five pillars of energy policy — reliability, resilience, stability, affordability and environmental sustainability.

Olson said he does not see how a plan that will raise costs falls into those pillars.

“It should not be ratepayers funding this thing,” he said. “Part of our issue with this ruling is how the state of Indiana is allowing this thing to be financed, and they’re allowing this thing to be financed on the backs of ratepayers.”

Protegere reiterated the Cayuga project was determined to be the right solution for meeting the needs of demand across the state, balancing the need for consistent service with cost and environmental regulations.

“This is a way to do it efficiently with natural gas units, but also gradually spread out the rate impacts over a number of years.”

Nextracker holds a strong market position in the solar industry

Nextracker provides integrated solar tracking systems and related solutions for solar projects across the world. Its primary product is a pivoting base that enables solar panels to follow the sun's movement across the sky, optimizing performance and getting the most energy out of daylight. Panels mounted on its single-axis solar trackers can generate up to 25% more energy than non-tracking solar panels.

Nextracker is the top tracker provider in the world, with leading positions in North America and Latin America, and a 26% global market share.

From this position of competitive strength, Nextracker is evolving from a single product supplier into a diversified solar power platform company. It's doing so by acquiring and developing adjacent technologies, which will allow it to lower costs for customers and accelerate construction timelines. Management believes its non-tracker products and services sales could grow to provide more than one-third of the company's total revenue in the next five years.

Investors got more regulatory clarity

When the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" was first introduced in Congress, solar investors were nervous about the mixed signals it sent on energy policy. On the one hand, it offered major infrastructure and industrial incentives, but on the other, it seemed fossil fuels might benefit more from tax breaks and regulatory relief.

When the final details came out, the bill turned out to be ""better than feared"" for the solar industry, according to JPMorgan analyst Mark Strouse. Some key aspects of previously established law that supported solar energy were left intact, including some investment tax credits. That said, Congress and the president did sharply curtail the duration and accessibility of some of those clean energy tax credits and incentives, and added new compliance hurdles for companies that want to make use of them.

Growing demand for energy could be a tailwind for Nextracker

Nextracker's opportunity will come from the growing demand for clean energy to power tomorrow's technologies. While many hyperscalers and investors have focused on nuclear power, which is coming back into favor, Nextracker's solar power solutions could benefit as companies seek a variety of carbon-neutral solutions to meet their growing energy needs.

According to the International Energy Agency(IEA), solar power is on track to become the largest source of renewable electricity worldwide in just a few years. Not only does it provide clean energy at competitive prices, but solar arrays can be deployed quickly compared to other energy sources, meeting demand in the near term -- not five years from now.

Improvements in energy storage systems and their widening use could be a massive tailwind for Nextracker as well. Management describes solar and storage as an ""unbeatable"" combination. That optimistic view is well founded. In the company's fiscal second quarter (which ended Sept. 26), its backlog -- signed customer orders for its solar tracking systems and related technologies awaiting fulfillment -- reached a record $5 billion.

That deep backlog and the company's large project portfolio provide it with revenue visibility and reduce the uncertainty it faces due to the current U.S. policy backdrop. Management noted that a high percentage of projects in its U.S. backlog have safe harbor status that locks in their eligibility for key tax credits and incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Is Nextracker a buy?

Energy demand is on the rise, and Nextracker is a stock that may be overlooked in this sector. With a forward-price-to-earnings ratio of 21, the stock appears reasonably priced, particularly when compared to some other alternative energy providers that are trading at sky-high valuations.

Nextracker remains vulnerable in the current political landscape, especially given that some tax credits and incentives intended to support clean energy have been curtailed. That said, Nextracker continues to provide solutions that help address America's growing energy demands, and its fair valuation provides investors with some cushion, which is why I think it could be a good stock buy today.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/840036/engineers-walk-beside-rows-of-solar-panels.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 19:59:22.917228

Virginians need to raise their voices and make clear they don’t want to pay higher prices for dirtier energy.","President Donald Trump stormed back into the White House on a campaign focused on costs. Part of his argument was a pledge to “cut your energy prices in half within 12 months.” As we close in on that mark, energy prices are rising at more than twice the overall rate of inflation. Average electricity rates in Virginia were up 11.3% year over year as of July.

Since taking office, Trump has used every lever of power available to disadvantage cleaner, cheaper energy and prop up and promote the accelerated burning of fossil fuels.

The first eight months of this administration have seen an all-out assault on clean energy. Legislatively, it includes the repeal of tax credits that both spurred clean energy development and deployment and provided relief to consumers and businesses. On the regulatory front, it has involved extraordinary actions by the departments of the Interior, Energy, Treasury and Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency to hinder clean energy and promote fossil fuel use.

Iowans draw more than 60% of their power from wind energy and have among the lowest utility bills in the country. Yet on a visit to a national lab there, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright tried to argue that wind energy is unreliable and expensive. The assembled dignitaries and elected officials, all Republicans, weren’t having it, and the secretary begrudgingly acknowledged that Iowa has benefitted from its long-term investment in wind energy. Still, federal actions continue to impede the offshore wind industry in Virginia.

In parallel, the Trump administration is actively looking to extend the life of dirty, uncompetitive coal power plants, recently announcing $625 million in subsidies for these plants. This handout is a triple whammy: Taxpayers will pay for the subsidy itself, ratepayers will see higher electric bills — Energy Innovation notes that 99% of the U.S. coal fleet is more expensive to keep running than new cheaper, cleaner renewables — and we will all bear the pollution and climate impacts.

Blocking clean energy takes affordable options off the table at a time when Virginians are facing substantial electric bills. Clean energy offers some of the most affordable — and fastest ways — to provide new electric power. Last year, 93% of newly generated energy capacity that came online last year came from wind, solar and storage. According to a new analysis by Politico of U.S. Energy Information Administration data, the majority of states leaning heavily into wind and solar have lower electricity prices, and roughly half of these states are showing power bill increases below the national average.

But the Trump administration and its allies in state governments are actively restricting the supply of affordable, clean power when demand is skyrocketing from data centers, industry and homes. They’re freezing the permitting for wind projects, cutting clean energy tax credits, slowing down wind and solar on federal lands, and more — all while propping up dirty, outdated, costly fossil fuel plants.

The Center for American Progress’ analysis found that in 41 states and the District of Columbia, utilities had requested rate increases, which, if approved, will drive utility bills higher still. Utilities in Virginia have already requested rate increases five times for the 2025-2026 period.

In a recent survey for the Searchlight Institute, voters were asked to name the three monthly expenses that put the most strain on their household budget. Some 63% of respondents named utility bills — higher than any other category including groceries, housing and health care.

This cost chaos is not what voters signed up for. Virginians need to raise their voices and make clear they don’t want to pay higher prices for dirtier energy. It’s on our leaders to be responsive to the needs of their constituents and, yes, lead.

Are the fish safe to eat? Are the animals who live in the water getting sick? What are the new innovations for keeping the Bay and its tributaries healthy? How can art help environmentalists think more creatively? These are some of the questions addressed at the State of the San Francisco Estuary Conference, which was held this week at Oakland’s Scottish Rite Center.

The event was organized by the San Francisco Estuary Partnership, a regional collaborative of government agencies, nonprofits and community groups that work to protect and restore the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. It is one of 28 estuary partnerships across the country established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and funded by Congress.

According to SFEP Director Caitlin Sweeney, the partnership program has been funded through the year and has broad bipartisan support.

Each year’s conference opens with a progress report. Sweeney delivered a summary in front of a projected color-coded scorecard.

The report evaluates the health of the estuary in 24 indicators grouped into five categories — clean water, quality of habitat, resiliency of ecological processes, flourishing wildlife and public health.

“Here’s the 2025 scorecard,” Sweeney said. “As you can see, red and yellow predominate, meaning that most of these indicators are in fair or poor condition.”

Jay Davis, program director with the San Francisco Estuary Institute, a data-collecting scientific organization that monitors the Bay, began with a reminder of progress.

“Prior to the Clean Water Act of 1972 and other environmental regulations of the 1970s, the Bay and its shoreline were a dumping ground for minimally treated sewage, industrial wastewater, polluted runoff and solid waste,” said Davis. “With the passage of environmental laws, water quality showed a stunning improvement within 15 years, but the rate of overall progress has slowed in the past 30 years.”

“Is the Bay safe for swimming? The condition is good and holding steady,” he said, meaning that the water is clean enough for recreational use.

“Are fish safe to eat? The overall assessment is fair, but things have been steady and not changing,” Davis said, blaming the historic presence of mercury and industrial toxins as the main reasons that estuary fish are not entirely safe for human consumption.

Striped bass are popular for consumption and the main indicator species for mercury, he said, adding their health rating has hovered between fair and poor for the last 50 years.

Is the estuary safe for aquatic life, like birds and salmon?

“Water quality is fair and shows no change,” he said.

Concentrations of nutrients like fertilizer are higher in the Delta regions and put other parts of the estuaries at risk for harmful algal blooms, he said. But a proactive, massive initiative is underway to spend billions of dollars to upgrade our regional wastewater treatment plants to reduce nutrient inputs.

Not all algal blooms are toxic, but bad outbreaks of blue-green algae in warm waters can generate cyanotoxins, which can make people and animals ill when inhaled or touched.

Changes in the amount of cool fresh water that flows into the Bay from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta are one of the strongest indicators of overall health.

“Based on the amount of fresh water that actually flows into the bay each year, the estuary has been for decades experiencing chronic man-made drought conditions,” said independent consultant Christina Swanson.

“The [water quality] index declined from generally good conditions to fair conditions during the 1940s and early 1950s, reflecting the construction and operations of dams and ramped up water diversions from the Bay’s rivers and the Delta,” she said.

Swanson said 2006 was the last year with good conditions, and since then conditions have been poor in more than three quarters of all years.

The political perspective was delivered by David Lewis, executive director of Save The Bay, the area’s largest regional estuary advocacy organization. Lewis was presented with the SFEP Jean Auer Award for his significant contribution to the cause.

“We all know the challenges today are daunting,” Lewis said in his acceptance speech. “Ocean warming and acidification threatens the whole marine food web. With sea level rise, our wetlands will flood our communities within decades. And our 50-year-old environmental laws, like the California Environmental Quality Act, Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, are insufficient for what is facing us. They don’t help us speed up protection of environment and public safety from climate threats, floods and extreme storms, fires and droughts and rightly should be modernized.”

After the ceremony, Lewis said in an interview that the Trump administration has acted vindictively by targeting San Francisco Bay and California for cuts.

“The good news is that Californians passed a $10 billion climate bond last year in November, and one billion of that is for coastal resilience,” he said. “We were wise to pass measure AA in 2016 which has provided steady funding from people who live here.”

Measure AA generates about $25 million a year specifically for tidal marsh restoration, he said. A tidal marsh is an area that floods and drains with the daily tides and is crucial for protecting shorelines, cleaning water and providing essential habitats for dabbling ducks and baby salmon.

Creative thinking

At the 2024 conference last year, it seemed to be raining money. President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure bill had allotted $132 million for expanding and accelerating comprehensive plans created through the National Estuary Program, with underserved communities being the first to benefit. Any local community wanting to clean up their neighborhood creeks or restore native habitats could apply for a variety of state and county grants.

This year, the focus was on creative thinking.

Performance artist Diandra Marizet Esparza, delivered a keynote by reading interpretive prose from her journal and meditating on storytelling as a form of healing.

“When our sense of belonging is ruptured by politics, by migration, by storms and destruction, our stories can guide us back to a sense of hope,” she said.

An art exhibition in the main hall featured the Bay Clay Oyster Reef project by Daniel McCormick and Mary O’Brian. Their rock-like sculptures are made from heavy Bay silt. They are placed along the shoreline to promote the colonization of oyster beds that were wiped out by layers of silt released by mining practices in the Gold Rush era.

One of the most popular panels was all about Bokashi balls, a do-it-yourself organic chemical solution for improving water quality. Bokashi are golf ball-sized nuggets shaped by hand from a mixture of clay, wheat bran, wood ash and molasses. The final ingredient is beneficial microbials, pro-biotic bacteria commonly found in everyday items like yogurt that have digestive health benefits.

When the balls are dropped into dark waters, beneficial bacteria grow and out-competes the harmful bacteria found in pollutants and algae.

Cuauhtemoc Villa, who runs a youth engagement program in Portland, Oregon, said the use of effective microorganisms in organic farming was tested by chemical engineers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

“They are microbes like you’ll find in lactic acid bacteria, that we know from pickling,” he said. “If you think of pickles, it keeps things from going pathogenic. It’s a clean freak.”

The panel was organized by Charlie Toledo, executive director of the Suscol Intertribal Council, who attributes the Bokashi balls with cleaning the Napa River. Toledo reminded the audience that modern restoration practices can be done at the community level, just like pre-European forms of land management.

“[California] was not a wilderness,” said Toledo. “It was a managed agricultural preserve.

More than 1 billion pounds of pumpkins rot in U.S. landfills each year after Halloween, according to the Department of Energy.

Yours doesn’t have to go to waste. Experts told us your pumpkins can be eaten, composted or even fed to animals. Here’s how.

Cooking With Pumpkin Waste

If you’re carving a jack-o’-lantern, don’t throw away the skin or innards — every part is edible.

After carving, you can cube the excess flesh — the thick part between the outer skin and the inner pulp that holds the seeds — for soups and stews, said Carleigh Bodrug, a chef known for cooking with common food scraps.

You can also puree it and add a tablespoon to your dog’s dinner for extra nutrients. And pumpkin chunks can be frozen for future use.

“The seeds are a nutritional gold mine,” Bodrug said.

They’re packed with protein, magnesium, zinc and healthy fats, according to a 2022 study in the journal Plants.

One of Bodrug’s recipes involves removing the seeds, rinsing and roasting them with cinnamon for a crunchy snack or salad topper. Then you can use the stringy guts to make a pumpkin puree for muffins.

This version differs from canned purees in grocery stores — which typically use a different type of pumpkin or squash — because carving pumpkins have stringier innards and a milder flavor.

A carving pumpkin’s guts can still be used for baking — you’ll just have to amp up the seasoning to boost the flavor.

If you don’t want to eat your pumpkins, you can donate them to a local farm, which might use them to feed pigs, chickens and other animals.

Edible parts should be collected while you’re carving and before it’s painted, decorated or left on your porch for weeks. Paint and wax aren’t food-safe, and bacteria and mold can grow on the skin in outdoor climates.

Once you’ve cooked what you can and donated what’s safe to feed, composting the rest is the easiest way to keep it out of the landfill.

“That way, even though they’re not safe to eat, they can still give back to the earth,” Bodrug said.

Composting At Home Or Donating To A Farm

Composting pumpkins keeps them out of methane-emitting landfills and turns them into nutrient-rich soil instead. You can do this at home or drop them off at a local farm, compost collection bin or drop-off site.

“A large percentage of what ends up going to the landfill is stuff that could have been composted,” said Dante Sclafani, compost coordinator at Queens County Farm in New York. “So, even just cutting down something like pumpkins could really help curb how many garbage bags you’re putting out every week.”

Before composting, remove any candles, plastic, glitter, or other decorations — they can contaminate the compost.

A little glitter or paint won’t ruin the pile, but it’s best to get it as clean as possible before tossing it in. Then, chop up the pumpkin in 1-inch pieces so it can break down easier.

“Pumpkins are full of water, so it’s important to maintain a good balance of dried leaves, wood chips, sawdust, shredded newspaper, cardboard, straw — anything that’s a dry organic material— in your compost bin,” Sclafani said.

If you don’t maintain this balance, your compost might start to stink.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, a healthy compost pile should include a mix of “greens” — like pumpkin scraps and food waste — and “browns” like dry leaves, straw or cardboard, in roughly a three-to-one ratio. That balance helps the pile break down faster and prevents odors.

And if your pumpkin’s been sitting on the porch all month? That’s actually ideal.

“It’s never too far gone for compost,” Sclafani said. “Even if it’s mushy or moldy, that actually helps, because the fungus speeds up decomposition.”

“Composting anything organic is better than throwing it out because you’re not creating more refuse in landfills, you’re not creating methane gas,” said Laura Graney, the farm’s education director.

Graney said autumn on the farm is the perfect opportunity to teach kids about composting since it gives them a sense of power in the face of big environmental challenges.

“Even though they’re little, composting helps them feel like they can make a difference,” Graney said. “They take that message home to their families, and that’s how we spread the word.”",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/6HiQFo3_FCiWCAQ6ehbit6T_1Yk=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/7TACW4XB4ZGXJH6IW3FOZSQBUU.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 23:03:23.995932

Joseph “Joey” Wender, SHLB’s executive director, said the coalition had begun drafting a new three-to-five-year strategic plan focused on expanding its impact. “Momentum was on our side,” he said, citing the Supreme Court in Federal Communications Commission v. Consumers’ Research, in which SHLB participates, and new partnerships.

Cindy Aden, program chair at the University of Washington Information School, led the planning workshop and urged attendees to identify new audiences and measurable outcomes to guide SHLB’s next phase of advocacy.

SHLB is uniquely positioned to connect broadband policy to real-world access gaps, she said. “How could we talk about AI in education if students still didn’t have the connectivity they need to learn?”

Panelists said SHLB’s next chapter should emphasize outreach to smaller, rural, and under-resourced institutions.

One participant from West Texas described towns of just 700 to 11,000 residents where limited broadband access left students unfamiliar with modern workplace technology and disconnected from industry standards. Aden and others said those realities, where geography dictated opportunity, had to be reflected in federal and state broadband policy, not treated as anecdotal gaps.

From expansion to preservation

Kristen Corra, policy counsel at SHLB, said the coalition’s policy environment had shifted since the Biden administration, moving from expansion to preservation. “A few years ago, we were modernizing: adding hotspots, Wi-Fi on buses, and pushing future-focused rules,” she said. “Now we’re fighting to sustain what was built.”

Still, she said SHLB’s advocacy remained strong, pointing to durable partnerships with state broadband offices, anchor institutions, and education groups that “keep the mission alive, even as the funding climate changes.”

Philip Neufeld, executive officer for strategic research at the Fresno Unified School District, said practical resources, such as shared templates, case studies, and baseline connectivity standards would help small districts advocate more effectively at local school boards.

The West Texas participant added that “when you have clear benchmarks, you gain confidence in front of the school board, and confidence drives investment.”

Wender closed the session by urging members to continue sharing data and stories that link connectivity and measurable outcomes. This coalition’s strength, he said, is in the voices it brings together.",https://broadbandbreakfast.com/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.59.23---PM-1-1.png,N,,2025-11-01 17:59:23.652509

While some networks carry heavy environmental and social costs, Algorand was designed from the ground up to be energy‑efficient, resilient and ready for real‑world scale.

Its single‑layer, quantum‑secure architecture delivers instant finality, consistently high throughput and low fees, capabilities that make verifiable traceability, carbon accounting and renewable‑energy tokenisation practical for modern supply chains.

Sustainability in this context means combining strong security and scale with the smallest possible environmental footprint.

Algorand minimises energy use while enabling builders to meet robust standards for transparency and user rights, key requirements for audit‑ready provenance and chain‑of‑custody solutions.

The Algorand Foundation steers ecosystem growth, maintaining core infrastructure and technical standards, supporting entrepreneurs, enabling decentralised governance and offering a best‑in‑class developer environment where teams can build in familiar languages such as Python.

Founded in 2019 by Turing Award‑winning cryptographer Silvio Micali, Algorand now supports a vibrant community of developers, enterprises and millions of retail users drawn to low fees and instant settlement.

Marc Vanlerberghe, Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, who helped launch Android at Google, drives institutional adoption of a sustainable, future‑ready blockchain. Matt Keller, Head of Impact and Inclusion and former leader at the UN World Food Programme, One Laptop per Child and the Global Learning XPRIZE, forges partnerships that expand financial access, advance environmental sustainability and build community resilience.

Here, Marc and Matt share how Algorand is scaling sustainable blockchain to support transparent, high‑integrity supply chains and next‑generation carbon and renewable markets.

How is Algorand helping companies prove their sustainability?

Marc: Having verifiable, trusted sustainability programmes is key - and not just because many companies are under pressure from regulators and consumers to prove their sustainability claims.

Algorand helps by giving them a way to record data about their sustainability (from product origins to the supply chain’s footprint) on the blockchain, so their efforts are immutable, transparent and verifiable.

Supply chains can be fragmented and prone to fraud, making it hard to verify sustainability claims without a trusted digital infrastructure.

Algorand addresses that gap, ensuring data integrity (tamper-proof, time-stamped records) and giving consumers and regulators confidence that claims are accurate.

Algorand’s high throughput and reliability allow it to handle complex, high-volume supply chains on a global scale.

Because Algorand itself is carbon neutral, businesses can rely on a platform that aligns with their sustainability commitments and ESG goals.

Matt: Some of the companies building on Algorand include Wholechain, which uses Algorand to provide end-to-end traceability for supply chains in industries like seafood and personal care.

Every step of a product’s journey is immutably recorded, helping prove ethical sourcing, authenticity and sustainability.

Another one is Finboot, which works with major enterprises, including those in the oil and gas industry, to integrate blockchain into their supply chain management.

This helps track raw materials and processes, providing a verifiable record of sustainability practices across industrial sectors.

Can Algorand help with carbon reduction projects?

Marc: Transparent carbon monitoring (and transparent carbon markets) are one piece of the puzzle to reducing carbon emissions, but many existing systems are siloed.

Algorand helps companies record verified emissions data in real time on the blockchain.

And by combining blockchain with Internet of Things (IoT) devices and AI, projects can automate monitoring, reduce costs and make verification more reliable.

This creates opportunities for both enterprises and households (usually excluded from these markets) to participate in carbon markets, turning emission reductions into credits that can be applied toward income or energy payments.

Algorand's speed, low fees and efficiency make it possible to scale these kinds of carbon markets.

The Algorand Foundation also shows this in practice by offsetting its own footprint every year through ClimateTrade, a marketplace built on Algorand.

An impressive example of this is Ureca, which uses Algorand with IoT and machine learning to verify carbon reduction projects.

Emissions data is collected and logged on Algorand in real time, creating trusted records for investors, regulators and communities.

The platform enables households and enterprises to measure emissions, generate credits and apply them to bills or income.

Can Algorand help people access renewable energy?

Marc: Absolutely.

The tokenisation of renewables is what makes them more accessible to everyone, no matter where they live.

Many people cannot, for example, install rooftop solar because they live in apartments or in restricted buildings.

Tokenisation on Algorand makes renewable energy accessible to them - meaning they can benefit from renewable energy projects - without having the direct infrastructure.

Tokenisation allows you to create a fungible or non-fungible token version of an asset. These tokens then represent fractional ownership of an asset like solar or wind farms.

This model creates inclusion in the green transition and makes clean energy more widely available.

Enel, one of the largest energy utilities in the world, partnered with Conio to launch the EBITTS project on the Algorand blockchain.

The project tokenises Enel’s renewable assets, allowing consumers to purchase “Energy Utility Tokens” representing fractional ownership in solar and wind plants.

Marc: Other chains are also progressing on this front, but one obstacle remains: how well these other blockchains can scale.

As they get more traffic and add more computers to their network, that means more compute power (and electricity) is required.

One way blockchain can continue to be more conscious is to make its hardware requirements lighter (like that of Algorand) and to take actions like purchasing offsets, so any existing carbon footprint is managed.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/5105962ba4d0d85d59287ab4a8cb94b2:98f49f5d0bac1cfcf9afd85d87f254d5/algorand-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 01:18:12.480844

ExxonMobil Chemical Limited has been fined £176,000 after pleading guilty to breaching its environmental permit during a six-day flaring event at its Cowdenbeath site in April 2019. The flaring caused significant disruption to the local community with residents describing the noise as “like a jet engine”. It led to over 900 complaints, the highest ever recorded for a single environmental event in Scotland.

The conviction follows an extensive regulatory investigation involving our specialist regulatory, technical, scientific and enforcement staff, which resulted in referral to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) in July 2020.

Our investigation found that:

Smoke emissions exceeded legal limits for 110 minutes, more than seven times the permitted 15-minute duration.

Noise pollution was significant, confirmed by monitoring in the community and resident statements.

Existing contingency plans weren’t followed to a high enough standard.

Poor maintenance, a lack of understanding of the site’s steam balance, and outdated risk analyses contributed to the incident.

Through our regulatory requirements, the company has since made major investments to reduce future flaring, including installing low-noise flare tips and upgrading steam systems. We’ll keep monitoring compliance to ensure lasting improvements and real benefits for the community.

Scottish household stats: small gains, big opportunities in recycling

Scotland’s household waste statistics, published this week, show a slight increase in recycling rates. In total, 44.3% of household waste was recycled in 2024. However, over half of what goes in general bins could still be recycled, including food waste, paper, cardboard and plastics.

Each person generated 0.42 tonnes of waste last year, with 0.19 tonnes recycled, 0.05 tonnes landfilled, and the rest diverted, mostly through incineration. While landfill use continues to decline (down 82.5% since 2011), incineration rose by 37.6% from 2023.

The carbon impact of household waste was 5.31 million tonnes CO₂e (Carbon Dioxide Equivalent), a 21.5% reduction since 2011, demonstrating the environmental benefits of recycling and waste reduction.

Small changes at home can make a big difference. By recycling more and wasting less, households can play a part in reducing emissions and supporting Scotland’s transition to a circular economy.

CEO focus: shaping the future of our environment

Nicole Paterson, our Chief Executive, has set out an ambitious, customer-focused programme of transformation that will enhance how we protect and improve the environment for the communities of Scotland.

Scotland’s environment doesn’t exist in isolation to global changes, technological advances and societal interests. To be dynamic and future focused it's important that we stay ahead of developments, collaborate, listen and influence.

This month, Nicole shares some personal highlights from October, offering a glimpse into how she’s championing this transformation and shaping our journey forward.

I started this month at the Scottish Parliament, sharing how SEPA are delivering for Scotland. The informal drop-in session gave MSPs, researchers and parliamentary staff the opportunity to learn more about how we not only protect and improve the environment but are also supporting communities and business.

We covered everything from how we manage water scarcity to digital innovation in regulation and advanced technologies like AI and eDNA. Giving elected members and their teams more information on our work means they can better signpost to our services and use the outcomes in their own work to support people in Scotland.

As we saw through our VIBES Awards, Scotland’s businesses are really taking on the climate challenge and helping us move towards Net Zero. This year I’ve been a judge on the Institute of Directors (IoD) Scotland Director of the Year Award 2025 and had the opportunity to meet the shortlisted candidates and winners. At the award ceremony earlier this month, we celebrated the incredible leadership and innovation across Scotland’s business community.

As I mentioned previously, Scotland’s environment doesn’t exist in isolation and so engaging across national boundaries is really important to help us plan for the future, share best practice and tackle some of the biggest challenges of our time. This month I joined environment leaders from across Europe at the 44th EPA Network Plenary, hosted by our counterparts Natural Resources Wales.

Despite the sobering insights from the European Environment Agency’s 2025 State of the Environment Report, the energy and innovation in the room were palpable. I was honoured to take part in a panel led by the European Commission on Simplification, sharing SEPA’s progress on implementing the Integrated Authorisation Framework through the Environmental Authorisations (Scotland) Regulations 2018, which will see businesses benefit from streamlined, easier to understand regulations and our work focus on activities that can cause the most risk to our environment.

On Wednesday I was back in the Scottish Parliament, this time in a more formal setting at the Public Audit Committee contributing to the discussion on flood resilience in Scotland, which we play a vital role in helping the nation to prepare for, respond to and recover from flooding.

Building a future where Scotland’s environment and communities can thrive.

We have a leading role to play in making sure we are not only responding to today’s environmental challenges but actively shaping tomorrow’s solutions. How we deliver this and shape our plans involves all of us - our partners, our stakeholders and communities across Scotland. Through leadership, innovation and collaboration, we’re building a future where Scotland’s environment and communities can thrive.

Scotland slowly recovering from water scarcity

As we move into more unsettled and typically autumnal weather, our latest water scarcity report shows conditions are gradually improving but parts of the north and east have not yet recovered.

The length of time that rivers have been at low flows shows the accumulated impact of dry conditions over recent months. We’re continuing to monitor the situation closely and encourage water users to follow guidance based on local scarcity levels. Weekly reports and the Drought Risk Assessment Tool (DRAT) are still available to help communities and businesses stay informed and manage resources responsibly.

A project in Nebraska found success,JACK DURA,,,,,https://www.wftv.com/news/business/carbon-capture/EOJPZ7OC3U6MXEGM6CLN2O2XAY/,"“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it's released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,"" said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. ""And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn't easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn't been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don't want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota's legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company's agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass' cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass' line crosses his family's land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,"" he said, ""and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.""

THE WIZARD OF OZ stood looking at today’s Republicans, as they made their pleas:

The Republican Lion said, “We have no more Courage. Please, can you help us?”

“It’s not that you have no courage, you’re just under a spell. You simply need to remember, you’re capable of greatness. One of the greatest acts of courage was made by your fellow Republican, Abraham Lincoln. Against bitter opposition, he did the right thing for the nation, honoring our founders’ declaration that ‘all men are created equal,’ and he freed the slaves with his brilliant Emancipation Proclamation. I’m awarding you with this Top Hat, Lincoln’s trademark object, to help you discover the courage within you.”

The Lion’s eyes opened wide, he put on the hat, and he said, “Yes, black lives REALLY DO matter!” The Wizard smiled, and said, “See? You’re on your way!”

The Tin Republican said, “What about ME? I have no HEART!”

The Wizard said, “It’s not that you have no heart, it’s that you’ve been mesmerized by greed and fear. You’ve forgotten your proud roots. Think back to 1986, when one of your great Republicans, Ronald Reagan, recognized our obligation to our fellow citizens, and he signed into law EMTALA, the law that instructs hospitals that they MUST treat all patients who come to them with serious problems, regardless of their ability to pay. Not only did Reagan see health care as a right due all citizens, but he also said, “I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and lived here, even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.” So, Reagan granted immunity … AMNESTY … to MILLIONS of immigrants within our borders, knowing they were productive members of our society. Tin Republican, I’m awarding you this Reagan Cowboy Hat, so you might remember the HEART that once defined Republicans!”

The Tin Republican put on the hat, and said, “They are NOT eating our dogs! They are NOT eating our cats! They are our neighbors and friends!” The Wizard said, “There. Don’t you feel better?”

Then the Republican Scarecrow spoke up. “But I have no BRAIN! What can be done?”

The Wizard said, “It’s not that you have no brain. It’s that you’ve been led to believe in things that are not in your best interest by people who profit from your blind support. Think back to 1970, when one of your great Republicans CREATED the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Republicans back then recognized that human activity can create disastrous environmental problems, and that government has the obligation to protect our citizens. The EPA employed lots of great brains to address the many problems of environmental decline, and our air and water almost immediately became cleaner! Richard Nixon was that great Republican who applied his brain to address this serious national problem, and all citizens benefitted tremendously. I’m awarding you this PEN that Nixon used to sign the EPA into law.”

The Republican Scarecrow grasped the PEN, and said, “Global Climate Change is REAL! We NEED the EPA, and should absolutely NOT defund it!” The Wizard said, “That’s right. Don’t be fooled into complacency, embrace the knowledge and foresight of your great Republican predecessors. Reject those who would tell your brains and knowledge are BAD.”

Republican Dorothy said, “This new place we find ourselves is not good. We really should go HOME. There’s no place like it!”

The Wizard said, “AMEN!”

PAST COVERAGE: The list of clean energy grants, including in Oregon, Washington canceled by Trump admin.

Chris Green, president of the association, highlighted the impact, stating, ""We had a project that's going to use green hydrogen to make fertilizer. So you're displacing some of the natural gas and fossil-based products that go into fertilizer and creating a green product that has huge demand in Oregon and Washington and the Northwest, where we import all of our fertilizer currently from sometimes pretty far away places.""

The projects, spread across the Pacific Northwest, focus on producing, storing, transporting, and utilizing hydrogen in industries such as agriculture, transportation, and infrastructure.

While some projects may continue, others face setbacks. Green emphasized the importance of hydrogen in transitioning to clean energy and decarbonization, noting its role alongside solar, wind, batteries, and biofuels.

The cancellation has drawn criticism from U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, who described the decision as ""unprecedented and corrupt.""

She vowed to fight for the restoration of funds, emphasizing the potential loss of over 10,000 jobs across the region.

In late October, dozens of hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles were delivered from TAM Europe to Seoul, South Korea, and Vienna, Austria, the first batch of hydrogen-powered buses produced by the Slovenian manufacturer.

The company currently has an annual production capacity of 500 electric commercial vehicles. During the Paris Olympic Games, TAM Europe supplied 24 electric buses to Paris Charles de Gaulle International Airport. Over the next three years, it plans to produce around 100 hydrogen-powered vehicles annually.

Founded in 1947, the Maribor Automobile Factory (TAM) was once renowned for producing trucks, trailers, and military vehicles. However, severe challenges amid market changes and economic restructuring eventually forced the company into bankruptcy in 2011.

After the infusion of Chinese investment and technology, production resumed in 2013, and the company retained its original brand. Year by year, TAM Europe has regained its vitality and reemerged as an active player on the European manufacturing stage. It has become a driving force in advancing green and sustainable urban transport through its hydrogen and electric buses.

The newly launched 70 MPa hydrogen fuel low-entry city bus marks another milestone in TAM's new energy production line. The model integrates Hyundai's hydrogen fuel cell system, hydrogen storage tanks, and power control system. Emitting only water vapor during operation, it marked a major step forward in the decarbonization of urban mobility.

""Our breakthroughs in environmental protection and technology upgrading have been key to our entry into the high-end European market,"" said TAM Europe CEO Ma Fuxiong, adding that the rollout demonstrates the factory's sophisticated craftsmanship and lean management in complex new energy assembly.

""It fully embodies the forward-looking layout and strong cross-border collaboration driven by Chinese capital in global green technology and high-end manufacturing - a vivid example of how 'Chinese wisdom' connects with global resources,"" Ma added.

Li Minghai, vice president for technology and manufacturing at TAM, highlighted the transformation brought by Chinese investment. He said that through strategic investment and resource integration, this green manufacturing project has gained strong momentum in the heart of Europe.

""It ensures efficiency at every stage - from technology alignment and supply chain management to production implementation,"" Li said.

FuelCellsWorks, a professional platform for the hydrogen and fuel cell sector, analyzed in an article that the successful rollout carries dual significance: it consolidates TAM's position as a European hub for specialty vehicles and new energy manufacturing, while also exemplifying the deep integration and synergy between Chinese capital and European industrial capabilities in green technology.

Some hydrogen fuel cell buses have entered operation in Seoul and Vienna. Li said, ""Our brand recognition is growing steadily, with customers now across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.""

At present, the company employs nearly 200 local workers. It regularly sends local employees to its plant in China to learn new technologies, while Chinese technicians also visit the Slovenian plant to provide on-site guidance.

""This is not only the success of a company but also a testament to win-win cooperation in green development,"" Li added. ■",,N,,2025-11-01 16:18:59.152735

Arizona agencies estimate $44 million in savings by transitioning to electric vehicles

State and local agencies and governments are pushing forward with plans to convert fleet vehicles to electric and install public charging stations despite the federal government’s efforts to curtail electric vehicle mandates and expansion.

The Arizona Department of Transportation, along with cities and counties across the state, has either installed or plans to install charging stations on government-owned property and on highways to increase accessibility for electric vehicle owners.

Some cities and counties have also replaced aging government fleet vehicles with electric and hybrid vehicles, with plans to acquire more electric vehicles.

The agencies and municipalities have developed electric vehicle and infrastructure plans for public electric chargers even as President Donald Trump’s administration ended a tax credit program for new and used electric vehicles.

The Trump administration also temporarily paused the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program this summer, which provides money to states to install electric vehicle chargers, before resuming it.

The Arizona Department of Transportation is receiving $76.5 million from the program to eventually build up to 74 rapid-charging stations along the state’s highways.

ADOT recently announced it is seeking bids from private companies to build and operate 34 electric charging stations along Interstates 10 and 40, U.S. Routes 60, 89, 93 and 160, and state routes 64, 68, 80, 87, 90, 95, 260 and 347.

The department approved an initial round of charger locations in August 2024, totaling 18 stations along Interstates 8, 10, 17, 19 and 40.

All of the stations will be privately owned and operated, with the federal money covering up to 80% of the cost and the private developer paying for at least 20% of the eligible project costs, according to ADOT.

Although the state is primed to grow the number of charging stations, the number of drivers who purchased electric vehicles decreased in October after the expiration of the tax credits.

According to J.D. Power, electric vehicles accounted for 5.2% of vehicle sales down from almost 13% in September.

Despite the drop, there is still an incentive for consumers and governments to purchase electric vehicles due to an overall cost savings, said Diane Brown, executive director of Arizona Public Interest Research Group (Arizona PIRG), which has advocated for local governments to integrate electric vehicles into fleets.

“Momentum is on the side of transportation electrification. Arizona has seen businesses start up and employ individuals leading to good jobs, and drivers of EVs have noted financial savings, as well as benefits to air quality and public health,” Brown said.

The Arizona PIRG Education Fund, the Nature Conservancy in Arizona and Frontier Group estimate that state agencies can save about $44 million over the next decade by transitioning to electric vehicles.

Brown said electric vehicle registrations in the state have increased over the years and several of the state’s largest municipalities have doubled or tripled the total number of electric vehicles in their fleets.

The city of Phoenix’s fleet includes 100 electric vehicles across multiple departments and more than 400 charging ports that are open to city employees, fleet vehicles and the public, according to city officials.

“While recent federal and state policy changes have created uncertainty for local governments, Phoenix continues to move forward with its clean fleet and infrastructure goals as outlined in the Transportation Electrification Action Plan (TEAP) and Climate Action Plan (CAP),” according to a statement from the city.

The city plans to expand to 500 city-owned chargers and 200 electric vehicles in its fleet by 2030, according to the statement.

The city was also awarded $15 million through the federal Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support new charging sites, especially in underserved neighborhoods, but those funds remain on hold pending a federal review, according to the city.

“Our commitment to sustainability remains strong regardless of changes at the federal level. Investing in EV infrastructure not only helps improve air quality and public health but also supports long-term economic growth and resilience for Phoenix residents,” said Karen Apple, the electric vehicle program manager for the city of Phoenix.

The city of Tucson has 85 electric vehicles with plans to add six more, while Sun Tran, the city’s transit service, has 10 electric buses in service with 10 more planned, according to city officials.

Sun Tran also received support from Tucson Electric Power to install 10 electric bus chargers, according to TEP spokesman Joseph Barrios.

TEP has also supported the city of Tucson and Pima County through its electrification program, which advises and supports governments and agencies that are looking to transition their fleets to electric vehicles and install charging infrastructure, Barrios said.

Pima County currently operates 137 electric vehicles and plans to acquire 65 electric or hybrid vehicles over the next several years, said Pima County Services Director Leonard Boswell in a statement.

“For the current fiscal year, the focus will be on procuring hybrid vehicles, which aligns with our long-term strategy and does not alter our existing acquisition plan,” Boswell said.",https://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2025/10/Electric-vehicles.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 15:58:56.045512

Back in the summer, the administration pulled $4 billion from the California high speed rail project. It followed up a month later by withdrawing another $175 million from the project. While these cuts alone won’t kill off the project, for which California voters have already approved tens of billions of funding through raising bond revenue, they do make it harder for the state to complete vital parts of the rail system. The federal dollars were being used for everything from building stations to constructing viaducts and railway bridges.

In 2019, when Donald Trump 1.0 attempted a similarly destructive maneuver against the high-speed rail system, California sued. Two years later, with Joe Biden as president, the funds were fully restored. This time around, California has sued again, arguing that the deprivation of funds, despite the project having fulfilled all the legally required reviews, is an act of political retribution — and one that puts more than 15,000 jobs on the line. In the meantime, the rail project continues, but with a giant hole in its budget thanks to the Trump administration’s efforts at punishing California for opposing the MAGA and Project 2025 agendas.

During the shutdown, Trump has been expanding the punitive model nationally, losing no opportunities to go after big-ticket items in blue parts of the country, and to roll back huge public sector investments contained in Biden’s three signature legislative achievements, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS Act. Between them, according to research by Robert Pollin, an economist at the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, these acts created 2.9 million jobs, 70 percent of which were aimed at people without college degrees. The jobs paid about $3 per hour more than equivalent private sector jobs and generated secondary spending in the regions of the country that attracted the most investments. Now, many of these signature public sector investments are on the chopping block, as are many other investments deemed by Trump to be “Democrat priorities.”

In early October, the Army Corps of Engineers put on hold $11 billion worth of water-related projects in a dozen blue states. Subsequently, the corps, falling back on new “Department of War” media guidelines about not releasing non-essential information during a government shutdown, refused to publicly provide details as to which projects had had the pause button pressed on them.

Later in the month, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Office of Management and Budget put the screws on Illinois by withholding more than $2 billion that had been earmarked for expanding the city’s elevated rail system — a massive project aimed at expanding the system into the impoverished far South Side of Chicago, that ground has already been broken on — and by nixing more than half a billion dollars in grants for energy-related projects around the state.

That same week, Trump announced on social media that he was “terminating” the Hudson Tunnel Project — a long-planned project that had garnered a $16 billion commitment from the federal government, to create a second railway tunnel, under the Hudson River, linking New York and New Jersey. That project, too, billed as the nation’s largest ongoing infrastructure project, is already underway, and its completion has now been put into doubt by Trump’s erratic politics-by-social-media-post behavior.

Compounding the damage to blue states, the administration also yanked billions of dollars in funding for clean energy projects around the country. All but one of the states that lost this money were blue states; the one outlier was New Hampshire, whose Republican governor was on Trump’s shit list because she had stood up to him when he ordered red states to implement mid-decade redistricting to try to predetermine the outcome of the 2026 midterm elections.

This game of raw power politics comes with a high cost. Yanking dollars from projects that are already underway means putting large numbers of jobs at risk — both the jobs of those working directly on the impacted projects and the secondary ones that are generated when those federal dollars circulate through local economies.

Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, estimates that at least 11,000 people are currently working on the New York–New Jersey tunnel project. Beyond those numbers, however, he believes that at least another 11,000 are in jobs (in the restaurant industry and other service sectors) that would likely evaporate if all of those construction workers no longer had employment and thus income to spend locally. While the disappearance of 22,000 jobs in a metropolitan region with 6 million workers wouldn’t in itself trigger a local recession, for the impacted workers those lost jobs could mean dreams shattered and the triggering of financial chaos. “The construction jobs will be very hard to replace,” Baker told Truthout. In a period when the residential and commercial construction industries are already in the doldrums, “They’re not going to have an easy time finding other jobs.”

Baker calculates that the cumulative damage done by the cessation of the flow of federal dollars into all of these projects around the country will hit many tens of thousands of workers. Regarding the clean energy projects alone, he believes that somewhere in the region of 50,000 jobs are at risk.

“Every million dollars you pull out, you’re going to lose about ten of these jobs,” Robert Pollin told Truthout. “The jobs that replace them won’t be the same quality of jobs, because these are good working-class jobs.”

“It’s clearly just punitive,” Baker says. While the states have already begun suing to protect their federal dollars, the economist anticipates that there will be different outcomes in different state lawsuits and that eventually it will fall to the Supreme Court to decide whether Trump’s financial actions against cities and states that oppose his agenda are constitutional. In normal times, he says, it would be a slam dunk that the Supreme Court would nix this behavior; but, given the hyper-conservative nature of the current Supreme Court majority, three of whom are Trump appointees, he has “no idea how the court will rule,” he says.

It is entirely possible that over the coming year the nation’s highest court will greenlight federal actions designed to deliberately economically harm denizens of blue regions of the country. If they do, it’s a fair bet that Trump and OMB chief Russell Vought will accelerate their assaults on the economic health, and the income streams, of blue-leaning parts of the country, dismantling still more of the investments generated by Biden-era legislation.

“These are large amounts of money for local economies,” Thomas Palley, a D.C.-based economist who publishes the Economics for Democratic and Open Societies newsletter, told Truthout. “It’s a big deal for local economies. This is really unprecedented. People on those projects will be laid off. There are material consequences to people who have businesses reliant on government contracting. And there’s an uncertainty impact. People will put plans for business expansion on hold. People will be taking precautionary steps.”

At some point, Palley says, if the squeeze on blue states gets too extreme, those states might end up trying to respond by finding ways to interrupt the transfer of payments from state taxpayers to the federal government. But, until then, he says, everyone’s at the mercy of “the clown with the razor blade; he’s willing to run around and slash people.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2198598158.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 16:19:03.387625

The Competitive Enterprise Institute has positioned itself at the center of a heated debate over federal energy policy, challenging the conventional wisdom that government subsidies for green technologies serve America's strategic interests. Their argument centers on what they term CEI's case against artificial rare earth demand – a phenomenon they claim undermines market efficiency and paradoxically strengthens the very dependencies these policies aim to reduce.

Defining Government-Induced Demand Distortions

Government subsidies fundamentally alter natural market dynamics by incentivising consumption patterns that would not exist under purely economic conditions. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, federal tax credits for electric vehicles reached $7.5 billion in 2023, directly influencing consumer purchasing decisions beyond what underlying technology merits would support (U.S. Energy Information Administration, ""Federal Financial Interventions and Subsidies in Energy Markets,"" 2024).

This intervention creates what economists classify as deadweight loss, where resources flow toward politically favoured technologies rather than economically optimal solutions. The distinction between organic market adoption and policy-accelerated deployment becomes particularly relevant when examining rare earth-intensive technologies that require substantial mineral inputs per unit of energy produced.

The Role of Federal Energy Policies in Market Manipulation

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allocated approximately $369 billion toward clean energy incentives, with substantial portions directed toward technologies requiring significant rare earth elements. Wind turbines typically require 200-600 kilograms of rare earth materials per megawatt of capacity, while electric vehicle motors contain 1-2 kilograms of neodymium and smaller quantities of dysprosium and terbium (U.S. Geological Survey, ""Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024"").

These subsidy mechanisms create artificial demand spikes that exceed what market forces alone would generate. Industry data suggests that without federal incentives, electric vehicle adoption rates would likely remain 40-50% below current levels, directly translating to reduced pressure on rare earth supply chains (Congressional Budget Office, ""Federal Subsidies for Electric Vehicles,"" 2023).

Furthermore, understanding mining permitting guidelines becomes crucial when examining how regulatory barriers interact with these demand-side policies to create additional market distortions.

The Unintended Geopolitical Consequences of Green Energy Incentives

The strategic implications of increased rare earth consumption extend far beyond domestic energy policy considerations. China currently controls approximately 85% of global rare earth processing capacity, creating a bottleneck that federal subsidies inadvertently strengthen through increased demand pressure.

Supply Chain Vulnerability Through Increased Consumption

China's dominance across the rare earth value chain represents one of the most concentrated resource dependencies in the global economy. The country processes over 90% of heavy rare earth elements, including dysprosium and terbium, which are essential for high-performance permanent magnets used in wind turbines and electric vehicle motors (Institute for Defence Analyses, ""Rare Earth Elements in National Defence,"" 2023).

Each subsidised wind farm installation requires substantial quantities of these materials:

Neodymium: 150-200 kg per MW of wind capacity

Dysprosium: 20-30 kg per MW for high-efficiency turbines

Terbium: 5-10 kg per MW for advanced generator designs

Praseodymium: 50-75 kg per MW as neodymium substitute

This consumption pattern means that accelerated renewable deployment through subsidies directly increases dependence on Chinese processing capabilities, potentially creating greater strategic vulnerability rather than reducing it.

The Dependency Paradox in U.S. Energy Policy

The contradiction between energy independence goals and rare earth dependency creates what analysts term the ""green minerals paradox."" Policies designed to reduce fossil fuel imports simultaneously increase reliance on Chinese-controlled mineral processing, potentially trading one form of energy dependence for another.

Historical precedent suggests that supply disruptions in critical mineral markets can have severe economic consequences. The 2010 rare earth export restrictions imposed by China following a diplomatic dispute with Japan led to price increases of 300-2000% across various rare earth oxides, demonstrating the leverage that concentrated supply chains provide (U.S. Government Accountability Office, ""Rare Earth Materials: Developing a Comprehensive Approach Could Help DOD Better Manage National Security Risks,"" 2023).

However, critical minerals energy security considerations extend beyond just rare earths, encompassing a broader range of materials essential for national defence and economic stability.

Market Inefficiencies and Resource Misallocation Patterns

Economic theory suggests that subsidies create distortions by separating consumption decisions from true production costs, leading to suboptimal resource allocation across the broader economy. CEI's case against artificial rare earth demand rests heavily on these efficiency arguments.

Price Signal Disruption in Critical Mineral Markets

Federal subsidies effectively mask the true cost of rare earth-intensive technologies by socialising mineral input costs through taxpayer support. This disruption prevents accurate price discovery, which typically guides investment decisions in mining and processing infrastructure.

Without clear market signals, private investors struggle to assess the economic viability of domestic rare earth projects. The Mountain Pass mine in California, for example, has faced periodic operational challenges partly due to uncertain long-term demand patterns influenced by policy rather than fundamental economics (Reuters, ""MP Materials restarts rare earths production,"" 2024).

Capital Allocation Consequences Across Industries

Subsidy-driven demand creates ripple effects throughout the investment landscape, potentially diverting capital from more economically viable alternatives. Research by the American Enterprise Institute suggests that every dollar of clean energy subsidies may displace 60-80 cents of private investment in competing technologies (American Enterprise Institute, ""The Hidden Costs of Green Industrial Policy,"" 2024).

This crowding-out effect extends to rare earth supply chain development, where uncertain policy trajectories make long-term infrastructure investments riskier. Processing facilities require 5-7 years to develop and billions in capital investment, timelines that extend beyond typical political cycles and subsidy programme durations.

The Free-Market Alternative to Industrial Policy Approaches

CEI advocates for regulatory reform rather than subsidy expansion as the primary mechanism for addressing rare earth supply chain vulnerabilities. Their approach emphasises removing barriers to domestic production while allowing market forces to determine optimal technology adoption rates.

Regulatory Barriers as the Primary Supply Constraint

Federal permitting processes for mining projects average 7-10 years in the United States, compared to 2-3 years in Australia and Canada (Fraser Institute, ""Annual Survey of Mining Companies 2023""). These lengthy timelines create uncertainty that discourages investment regardless of underlying demand conditions.

Environmental review requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act often add 2-4 years to project development timelines, even for facilities processing already-mined materials. The proposed Texas processing facility for rare earth separation faced a 3-year environmental review process despite utilising existing industrial infrastructure (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, permit records 2023).

Key regulatory bottlenecks include:

Mining permits: Average 8.5 years for new operations

Processing facility approvals: 4-6 years for separation plants

Transportation infrastructure: 3-5 years for specialised logistics

Waste management permits: 2-4 years for tailings facilities

Market-Driven Solutions for Supply Chain Security

Free market mechanisms could theoretically address supply chain vulnerabilities through price signals that encourage diversification and substitution. Higher rare earth prices resulting from supply constraints would naturally incentivise domestic production and alternative technology development.

Private sector recycling initiatives have already begun responding to supply pressures. Urban Mining Company reports recovering 95% of rare earth content from end-of-life permanent magnets, with processing costs 30-40% below primary mining when operating at scale (Urban Mining Company, ""Rare Earth Recycling Economics,"" 2024).

In addition, recent developments such as the executive order on critical minerals demonstrate how policy changes can influence market dynamics and investment decisions in the sector.

International Market Forces Beyond U.S. Policy Control

The global context challenges CEI's focus on U.S. subsidy elimination as a solution to rare earth market distortions. International demand drivers operate independently of American policy decisions and continue expanding regardless of domestic subsidy policies.

European and Asian Consumption Driving Worldwide Growth

The European Union's Green Deal allocated €1 trillion toward carbon neutrality by 2050, with substantial portions directed toward technologies requiring rare earth elements. Germany alone plans to install 115 GW of wind capacity by 2030, requiring approximately 23,000-69,000 tonnes of rare earth materials (European Commission, ""REPowerEU Plan,"" 2024).

China's domestic consumption has become the largest single driver of global rare earth demand, accounting for over 60% of worldwide usage. The country's internal green energy transition, including plans for 1,200 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, creates demand pressures that dwarf American consumption patterns (China National Energy Administration, ""14th Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy,"" 2024).

Region Annual REE Consumption (tonnes) Primary Applications China 135,000-150,000 Domestic manufacturing, green energy Europe 25,000-30,000 Wind energy, automotive Japan/Korea 20,000-25,000 Electronics, automotive United States 15,000-20,000 Defence, energy, electronics

Consequently, initiatives like the European CRM facility highlight how other regions are developing their own strategic responses to rare earth supply challenges.

Defence and Technology Sectors as Non-Subsidised Drivers

Military applications represent a significant source of rare earth demand that operates independently of clean energy subsidies. Each F-35 fighter aircraft contains approximately 417 kilograms of rare earth materials, while advanced radar systems require substantial quantities of yttrium and terbium (U.S. Department of Defence, ""Industrial Capabilities Report,"" 2023).

The artificial intelligence boom has created new demand sources through data centre expansion and specialised computing hardware. High-performance permanent magnet motors used in server cooling systems and quantum computing applications require ultra-pure rare earth materials, adding pressure to supply chains regardless of renewable energy policies.

Furthermore, China's new rare earth and magnet restrictions threaten US defence supply chains, highlighting how geopolitical tensions exacerbate supply chain vulnerabilities regardless of domestic demand policies.

Balancing Extraction Impacts with Technology Deployment

Environmental considerations add another layer of complexity to CEI's market-based arguments. Different technology pathways create varying demands on rare earth resources, with implications for mining intensity and ecological impact.

Mining Intensity Variations Across Energy Technologies

Comparative analysis reveals significant differences in rare earth requirements across energy systems. Offshore wind turbines require 2-3 times more rare earth materials per megawatt than onshore installations due to the need for direct-drive generators that operate in harsh marine environments (International Energy Agency, ""The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions,"" 2023).

Electric vehicle technologies show similar variation:

Battery Electric Vehicles: 1-2 kg rare earths per vehicle

Hybrid Electric Vehicles: 3-5 kg due to dual powertrains

Fuel Cell Vehicles: 0.5-1 kg primarily in electric motors

Conventional Vehicles: 0.1-0.3 kg in catalytic converters

Recycling and Circular Economy Considerations

Market-driven recycling could reduce primary mining pressure if price signals accurately reflect scarcity values. Current recycling rates for rare earths remain below 5% globally, primarily due to the dispersed nature of applications and collection challenges (United Nations Environment Programme, ""Global Material Flows and Resource Productivity,"" 2024).

Technology advances in magnetic separation and hydrometallurgical processing have improved recovery rates from electronic waste streams. However, economic viability depends on achieving sufficient scale and consistent feedstock supplies, factors that government policy could influence through waste management regulations rather than demand subsidies.

Strategic Reserves vs. Market Deregulation Strategies

Alternative policy approaches to rare earth security offer different trade-offs between market efficiency and strategic autonomy. Each mechanism creates distinct incentive structures and carries unique implementation challenges.

Policy Approach Implementation Cost Security Timeline Market Distortion Strategic Stockpiling $2-5 billion initial 2-3 years Low-moderate Domestic Mining Incentives $10-15 billion 8-12 years Moderate-high Processing Infrastructure $5-8 billion 5-7 years Moderate Regulatory Streamlining Administrative costs 3-5 years Minimal International Partnerships Negotiation costs 2-4 years Low

Strategic reserve systems could provide short-term supply security without creating ongoing demand distortions. The Defence Logistics Agency currently maintains reserves of specific rare earth materials, but quantities cover only 3-6 months of defence sector consumption (Defence Logistics Agency, ""Strategic Materials Status Report,"" 2023).

Projected Market Outcomes from Subsidy Elimination

Implementing CEI's recommendations would create significant adjustments across multiple sectors, with both intended and unintended consequences for rare earth supply chains and technology deployment.

Short-Term Adjustment Periods and Industry Responses

Elimination of federal subsidies would likely reduce renewable energy deployment rates by 30-50% in the near term, based on historical patterns when similar programmes expired. The wind industry experienced a 76% decline in new installations during 2013 when the Production Tax Credit briefly lapsed (American Wind Energy Association, ""Wind Industry Market Report,"" 2023).

Electric vehicle adoption could decline more dramatically, as purchase incentives directly influence consumer behaviour. Industry modelling suggests that removing the $7,500 federal tax credit could reduce EV sales by 40-60%, particularly affecting lower-income buyers for whom the incentive represents a larger percentage of vehicle cost (Congressional Budget Office, ""Federal Subsidies for Electric Vehicles Analysis,"" 2023).

Long-Term Supply Chain Evolution Scenarios

Reduced demand growth could paradoxically delay domestic rare earth processing development by decreasing investment returns for long-term infrastructure projects. Processing facilities require consistent demand over 15-20 year periods to justify capital investments, and policy uncertainty could extend development timelines.

However, slower demand growth might also reduce price volatility and supply pressures, creating more stable conditions for strategic planning. Companies could invest in supply chain diversification based on fundamental economics rather than policy-driven demand spikes.

Additionally, mining industry innovation continues to develop new approaches that could reduce costs and environmental impacts, potentially changing the economics of domestic production regardless of subsidy policies.

Counterarguments to the Pure Market Approach

Critics of CEI's position argue that market failures in critical mineral supply chains justify government intervention, particularly when national security considerations extend beyond pure economic efficiency.

National Security Considerations in Critical Mineral Policy

Defence applications for rare earth materials create strategic imperatives that may override economic efficiency arguments. Military systems often require specific performance characteristics that depend on particular rare earth elements, creating inelastic demand that persists regardless of price signals.

Competition with state-directed economies adds another dimension to the strategic calculus. China's government-subsidised approach to rare earth development created current market dominance through policies that disregarded short-term profitability in favour of long-term control. Purely market-based responses may prove insufficient to compete with state-sponsored industrial policy.

Market Failure Arguments in Critical Infrastructure Development

Large-scale infrastructure transitions exhibit characteristics of public goods that create coordination problems for private actors. Individual companies may underinvest in supply chain development if they cannot capture the full benefits of reduced strategic vulnerability.

First-mover disadvantages in emerging technology markets can also justify temporary intervention. Companies investing in domestic processing facilities face higher costs than established Chinese operations, requiring either premium pricing or policy support to achieve commercial viability.

Moreover, research indicates that rare earth elements are not as scarce as commonly believed, suggesting that supply constraints may be more about processing capacity and geopolitical control than geological scarcity.

Synthesis Approaches Combining Market Mechanisms with Targeted Intervention

Practical policy solutions may require hybrid approaches that address CEI's efficiency concerns whilst maintaining strategic flexibility for critical mineral security.

Hybrid Policy Frameworks for Critical Mineral Security

Regulatory streamlining combined with limited strategic incentives could address supply constraints without creating broad demand distortions. Accelerated permitting for domestic rare earth projects, coupled with strategic stockpiling, might achieve security objectives with minimal market interference.

Public-private partnerships for supply chain development offer another compromise approach. Government coordination and risk-sharing could support infrastructure development whilst maintaining private sector efficiency incentives and market discipline.

Measurement and Evaluation Criteria for Policy Effectiveness

Effective policy frameworks require clear metrics for distinguishing legitimate strategic needs from artificial demand creation. Key indicators might include:

Supply chain concentration ratios across critical materials

Import dependency percentages for defence and infrastructure applications

Price volatility measures in rare earth markets

Investment levels in domestic processing capacity

Technology substitution rates reducing critical mineral intensity

The Path Forward in Critical Mineral Policy Development

The debate over artificial rare earth demand reflects broader tensions between market efficiency and strategic autonomy in an increasingly complex global economy. CEI's case against artificial rare earth demand provides valuable insights into subsidy-induced distortions whilst highlighting the need for more nuanced approaches to critical mineral security.

Key Takeaways from the Artificial Demand Debate

Market distortions from federal subsidies create legitimate concerns about resource allocation efficiency and unintended strategic consequences. However, global demand realities extend far beyond U.S. policy influence, limiting the effectiveness of purely domestic solutions to supply chain vulnerabilities.

The integration of security considerations with economic efficiency goals requires policy frameworks that can adapt to changing market conditions whilst maintaining strategic flexibility. Neither pure market approaches nor comprehensive industrial policy appears sufficient to address the full range of challenges in critical mineral supply chains.

Implementation Considerations for Market-Based Reforms

Transition strategies for reducing subsidy dependence should account for existing investment commitments and international competitive dynamics. Regulatory reform priorities offer the most promising avenue for improving domestic supply capabilities without creating ongoing market distortions.

International coordination opportunities through trade agreements and strategic partnerships could address supply chain vulnerabilities through diversification rather than subsidisation, aligning with market-based principles whilst achieving security objectives.

The path forward requires balancing CEI's valid concerns about artificial demand with the reality of global market forces and strategic necessities that extend beyond pure economic considerations. Ultimately, CEI's case against artificial rare earth demand highlights the complexity of balancing market efficiency with strategic security in an interconnected global economy.

Central Europe has emerged as a key player in the adoption and commissioning of the renewable energy sector","As the world is consumed by the need to leave the traditional energy sector behind, Central Europe has emerged as a main accelerator of the global energy transition, playing out at the moment. Several Central European nations have seen astonishing increases in solar and battery storage projects, which will enable the energy sector to lean on the untapped potential that the renewable energy sector has stored away. Central Europe has relied on the gas and oil production coming from Russia and has plans to phase out energy from Moscow.

Renewable energy projects are key to the global energy transition

For far too long, the impact of the fossil fuel sector’s dominance on the global energy market has been ignored. Following the litany of climate disasters that have ravaged parts of the world, the political and social leaders worldwide have called for the renewable energy sector to receive significant investments to fast-track the transition of the energy market.

Reports have now emerged that state the key role that Central Europe will play in the global transition away from fossil fuels towards the renewable energy sector. Several nations in the region have developed and commissioned innovative projects that accelerate the transition and strengthen the standing of solar and battery storage systems that are locally produced.

Over the past three years, several Central European nations, including Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Poland, have sharply increased solar power capacity to boost local energy production. This rise has driven fossil-fuel generation to record lows in 2025.

The growth of solar power has been matched by the battery storage systems in Central Europe

The inevitable death of the conventional energy generation methods that the world has relied on for generations has been accelerated by the increase in solar capacity and improved domestically produced battery storage systems in Central Europe.

Notably, two nations are leading the charge to integrate the renewable energy sector in Central Europe, namely Austria and Hungary. Both nations have up until recently, relied on imports of energy from Russia, although a phase out of Russian gas and coal has forced them to sharply decrease that reliance. Austria now imports most of its gas from Slovakia, while Hungary still imports Russian-made gas and coal, although that number has declined too.

This year alone, Austria has generated about 17 % of its electricity from solar-powered projects, exemplifying the transitional nature of the Central European energy market. Hungary, on the other hand, has seen its solar share increasing to approximately 33%.

Battery storage systems have also seen tremendous growth over the past few years in Central Europe. Between 2022 and 2025, Austria, Hungary, and Romania boosted BESS capacity by roughly 472 %.

Industry experts and insiders have pointed out that regional capacity could grow more than tenfold by the end of the decade. Slovakia, which has been supplying energy to Austria, recently evaluated US technology for a planned 1.2 GW nuclear project, which could fast-track the energy transition in the region even further.

In an era of intensifying global supply challenges, the Trump and Australia critical minerals deal signals a bold shift towards reducing dependence on China. This transformation aligns with critical minerals demand, as industry leaders underscore vulnerabilities in existing frameworks.

Understanding Critical Minerals and Their Strategic Importance

The Foundation of Modern Technology

Critical minerals such as rare earth elements, lithium, cobalt, and gallium are the backbone of advanced manufacturing, defence systems, and clean energy technologies. Furthermore, these elements support semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries, and renewable energy projects. Their role in empowering modern society is undeniable.

Current Global Market Dynamics

Global rare earth reserves are highly concentrated, with China commanding a significant share. This disparity has led to pressing alternatives, as seen with the growing mining industry evolution. Moreover, shifting global conditions coupled with the US–China trade impact amplify these vulnerabilities.

China's Comprehensive Market Dominance Strategy

Mining and Processing Control

China’s dominance is rooted in decades of strategic investment. The nation controls approximately 69% of global rare earth mining capacity and 90% of refining operations. As a result, Western nations face significant challenges when attempting to develop their own processing facilities.

Manufacturing Integration Advantages

Beyond raw material extraction, China leads in the production of critical components. For instance, it produces 98% of global permanent magnets. This downstream integration bolsters China’s competitive cost advantages and underlines the sophisticated synergy between mining and manufacturing.

Comprehensive Partnership Framework Details

Financial Commitments and Investment Structure

The deal outlines an investment framework of $8.5 billion. It includes immediate U.S. project funding of $3 billion and the prospect of unlocking deposits valued at $53 billion in Australian territories. Furthermore, detailed projections create investor confidence in emerging alternatives.

Flagship Infrastructure Development Projects

Key projects include the Alcoa-Sojitz Gallium Recovery Project, which targets 10% of global gallium supply in Western Australia. Another is the Arafura Nolans Rare Earths Project in Australia’s Northern Territory, with $100 million in government backing. These initiatives aim to address supply vulnerabilities in defence and semiconductor applications.

Presidential Commitments and Timeline Projections

Analysts note that Trump’s critical minerals order foreshadows regulatory approvals rather than immediate production boosts. Experts expect that the initial phase could take up to one year before operational clarifications emerge. Additionally, a recent article on economic implications highlights the broader fiscal stakes of these projects.

Priority Mineral Targeting Strategy

Vulnerability Assessment and Strategic Focus

Analysts identify samarium, graphite, lutetium, and terbium as minerals most at risk from export limitations. This priority targeting is vital for reducing dependency on China.

Key vulnerable sectors include:

• Defence system components

• Thermal management in electronics

• Medical imaging tools

• Advanced lighting and green energy applications

Gallium Processing Breakthrough

The proposed Western Australia gallium refinery is designed to process 100 metric tonnes per year. It aims to break China’s hold on integrated gallium processing, a critical bottleneck in semiconductor and defence applications. This approach could significantly alter current supply chain dynamics.

Development Timeline and Realistic Expectations

Extended Development Requirements

Experts estimate 5–7 years for initial operations and 8–10 years for full-scale production. These projections account for the complex technical and regulatory challenges inherent in rare earth processing. Each phase will require meticulous planning and sustained capital investment.

Infrastructure and Expertise Development Challenges

Key challenges include:

• Securing environmental permits

• Developing a specialised workforce

• Constructing modern refining facilities

• Facilitating effective technology transfer

• Establishing robust market relationships

• Ensuring regulatory compliance

These factors underscore the long-term nature of the investment.

Economic Vulnerability Analysis

Supply Disruption Impact Assessment

Research from leading financial institutions shows that even a 10% disruption in rare earth supplies could incur losses of $150 billion in affected industries. This statistic reinforces the urgency of building resilient supply chains. Transitioning away from concentrated sources is critical for sustained economic stability.

Market Concentration Risks

The heavy concentration of mining capabilities in one region poses systemic risks. Consequential price volatility and supply delays affect sectors as diverse as semiconductors and renewable energy. Mitigating these risks will require strategic diversification and enhanced supply chain management.

Chinese Strategic Response and Countermeasures

Export Control Implementation

China has extended export controls by adding dozens of refining technologies to its controlled lists. Consequently, foreign producers who rely on Chinese materials must comply with stringent regulations. This approach effectively extends China’s influence over global supply chains.

Regulatory Extension Strategy

These new controls exemplify China’s efforts to maintain its competitive edge. By influencing regulatory standards overseas, China shapes market conditions to its advantage. This extraterritorial reach deepens the challenges for nations seeking to establish independent processing facilities.

Broader Alliance Building and International Cooperation

Multi-Nation Diversification Approach

The U.S. has expanded critical minerals cooperation beyond Australia by engaging with Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. This multi-nation approach aims to achieve:

• Geographic diversification

• Multiple processing hubs

• Cross-border technology sharing

• Reduced geopolitical vulnerabilities

Domestic Production Enhancement

Simultaneously, the United States is exploring domestic rare earth production enhancements. Measures include establishing strategic reserves and supporting mining companies with tariff protections. This dual approach integrates international partnerships with homegrown capability development.

Success Probability and Competitive Challenges

Realistic Impact Assessment

The Trump and Australia critical minerals deal is a crucial step towards diversifying global supply chains. However, sustained success depends on long-term funding, innovative technology transfer, and steadfast commitment. These factors must overcome entrenched competitive advantages in established markets.

Competitive Disadvantages and Barriers

Western projects face challenges such as:

• Higher operational labour costs

• Strict environmental regulations

• Limited specialised technical expertise

• Pre-established supplier networks with China

Overcoming these obstacles requires persistent investment and ingenuity.

Market Price Implications and Investment Opportunities

Price Dynamics and Market Evolution

Increased competition in rare earth supply chains may eventually moderate prices. Initially, infrastructure investments are expected to drive up costs. Investors and industry stakeholders must remain patient as alternative supplies gradually bolster market stability and reduce long-term pricing pressures.

Investment Risk Considerations

Potential investors should assess:

• Extended development timelines

• Capital-intensive processing facilities

• Uncertain demand patterns

• Competitive responses from established players

This measured approach is crucial for navigating the inherent risks of the sector.

Geopolitical Strategy and Defence Implications

National Security Considerations

Critical minerals are indispensable for modern military systems. They are used in missile guidance, radar systems, and advanced communications. Securing independent supply chains is thus a strategic imperative for national defence. Enhanced security protocols further underscore the urgency of this transformation.

Alliance Strengthening Through Resource Security

The U.S.-Australia partnership, bolstered by initiatives like the AUKUS trilateral agreement with the United Kingdom, reinforces resource-based alliances. Such frameworks promote mutual security and economic collaboration. They also provide a robust strategic framework for multilateral cooperation.

Environmental Sustainability and Innovation Opportunities

Sustainable Mining Practice Standards

Australian mining is known for stringent environmental compliance. These high standards set benchmarks for global responsible mining practices. Incorporating sustainable methods ensures minimal ecological disruption while securing critical resources. The emphasis on responsible extraction plays a pivotal role in long-term industry stability.

Processing Technology Innovation

Investments in new refining technologies are driving innovations in efficiency and environmental performance. Research focuses on:

• Cleaner chemical processing

• Waste reduction strategies

• Energy-efficient operations

• Automated quality control

In addition, modern waste management solutions are integral to minimising environmental footprints.

Long-Term Strategic Implications and Market Transformation

The Trump and Australia critical minerals deal marks a transformative phase in global resource management. It is now clear that long-term success depends on technological breakthroughs, environmental stewardship, and cohesive international policies. This partnership—echoing robust political will and economic resolve—challenges existing norms and paves the way for industry renewal.

In essence, the Alat Free Economic Zone reflects Azerbaijan’s commitment to combining sustainable energy development with an open and competitive investment environment.
The zone demonstrates the country’s readiness to attract international investors, promote clean industrial growth, and align economic diversification with global trends in renewable energy and innovation.","As Azerbaijan accelerates its green transition, the Alat Free Economic Zone (AFEZ) is rapidly positioning itself as the country’s flagship platform for clean technology and sustainable industrialization. The zone, located strategically near the Port of Alat south of Baku, is not only a logistics and manufacturing hub but increasingly a focal point for green investment and renewable energy innovation.

According to Valeh Alasgarov, Chairman of the Board of the AFEZ Authority, about 200 hectares of land have already been allocated for development, with 138 hectares presented to investors. Among them, 23 hectares are reserved specifically for solar panel production facilities, marking one of Azerbaijan’s most tangible steps toward building a domestic green energy supply chain.

“Three factories are planned - one focused exclusively on solar panel assembly, and two others producing silicon crystals and related materials,” Alasgarov noted, emphasizing the integrated nature of this industrial ecosystem.

Already, companies from China, India, Russia, Israel, and Türkiye have registered in the zone, with four actively constructing facilities and two expected to start production by the end of this year.

The AFEZ offers investors one of the most favorable regulatory and fiscal frameworks in the region. The zone operates under an independent legal regime, ensuring that state institutions cannot interfere in its internal activities. Investors enjoy tax and customs exemptions, along with ready-to-use industrial plots equipped with complete infrastructure and communication systems.

This model is designed to attract export-oriented and high-value-added industries - at least 75% of goods produced in the zone must be exported - ensuring integration with global markets while protecting the domestic economy from potential imbalances.

Such an approach clearly illustrates Azerbaijan’s strategic vision to position Alat as a key gateway between Europe and Asia, serving not only as a hub for logistics and trade but also as a center for clean and sustainable industrial development. The design of the Free Economic Zone reflects the country’s broader economic agenda, where diversification and green transition intersect - aligning industrial policy with global sustainability goals.

Azerbaijan’s broader commitment to green energy provides the policy backbone for initiatives like AFEZ. Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov recently underlined the scale of progress in the country’s energy sector, noting in Azerbaijan newspaper that:

“With the commissioning of new power plants, the total electricity generation capacity of our country has now reached 9,732.5 MW - an increase of 1,317 MW, or 15.6 percent, compared to the same period last year.”

He also highlighted the launch of the 1,880 MW “8 Noyabr” Power Plant, calling it “a shining example of international partnership in the field of electricity,” developed with Chinese and Italian companies.

This expanding energy mix includes renewable components, with 9 solar plants (278.2 MW) and 5 wind farms (63.5 MW) already in operation, alongside ongoing hybrid and waste-to-energy projects. The government’s declared goal of transforming Garabagh and Eastern Zangazur into “green energy zones” demonstrates that renewable development is no longer peripheral - it is now a pillar of national economic policy.

The convergence of energy transition policies and investment liberalization makes the Alat Free Economic Zone a strategic experiment in sustainable industrial policy. By offering a business-friendly environment tied to renewable production, Azerbaijan is signaling to global investors that it aims to be a regional leader in green industry.

Experts argue that AFEZ could soon play a critical role in attracting technology transfers, green finance, and climate-friendly manufacturing - from solar panels and batteries to smart infrastructure components.

This initiative represents a breakthrough in a sector that has faced considerable hurdles, including years of legal challenges and community opposition. Unlike other costly projects that have struggled without guarantees of success, the Tallgrass project has garnered praise due to its proactive community engagement and financial backing.

The pipeline facilitates the transportation of carbon dioxide emissions from eleven ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a designated site in southeastern Wyoming, where the gas will be injected and stored 9,000 feet underground. The fermentation process that turns corn into ethanol generates significant carbon emissions. By capturing these emissions, the plants can lower their carbon intensity scores, making their products more appealing for conversion into sustainable aviation fuel. This sector is anticipated to expand rapidly, with projections estimating an annual market of up to 50 billion gallons, particularly important as the demand for traditional motor fuels declines due to the increasing prevalence of electric vehicles.

Federal incentives, including lucrative tax credits, have played a crucial role in encouraging carbon capture practices. Both the Biden and Trump administrations supported the continuation of these credits, further incentivizing the industry.

In contrast to Tallgrass’ progress, at least three other companies have attempted to establish carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest. The Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions continues to pursue its ambitious multibillion-dollar project, which involves a network of pipelines across five states. Despite its backing from agricultural groups and the ethanol sector, Summit has faced fierce opposition from landowners resistant to the pipeline’s impact on their properties. Legal challenges and legislative actions have further complicated its efforts.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has stringent regulations governing the underground injection of carbon dioxide, ensuring that such activities protect drinking water sources. This rigorous permitting process is designed to safeguard environmental quality while enabling carbon storage in geological formations deep underground.

Tallgrass has attributed much of its success to the strategic retrofitting of an existing natural gas pipeline, minimizing the need for new construction. This approach has been complemented by extensive community outreach. The company collaborated with Bold Nebraska to establish a community investment fund designed to contribute to local initiatives, including early childhood development and senior care. The initial contribution of $500,000 will be followed by ongoing payments based on the carbon emissions captured. This arrangement is expected to generate over $7 million for community projects across 31 counties in four states by 2035.

Commentators have noted that the cooperative nature of Tallgrass’ approach has set a precedent that could serve as a model for future energy projects. Local leaders have expressed appreciation for the company’s willingness to engage openly with the community and address concerns. Experts emphasize the importance of listening and negotiating with stakeholders, suggesting that such practices could help alleviate fears associated with infrastructure projects.

While Tallgrass has set a high standard for community relations in pipeline development, some experts caution that replicating this success may be challenging due to the decreasing availability of natural gas pipelines suitable for retrofitting. Nonetheless, the company’s approach illustrates the potential for effective collaboration between energy infrastructure projects and local communities, underscoring the role of transparency and mutual benefit in navigating complex energy transitions.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tallgrass-Pipeline-Begins-Carbon-Capture-Operations-Amid-Community-Support.com2Ffe2Fbd2Fb6be0d909f80e3482b05e6f0605e2F17cfb49ea00f43c39cd8.jpeg,N,,2025-11-01 16:18:22.002911

Throw rising energy prices into the mix, and you can begin to see how a backlash might be brewing.","As tech companies tout their plans for massive new data centers, consumers are increasingly worried the AI-driven gold rush will ultimately drive up the price they pay for electricity, according to a new survey.

The report, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that 80% of consumers are worried about the impact of data centers on their utility bills.

Consumers’ concerns aren’t unfounded.

Electricity demand in the United States held steady for over a decade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Over the last five years, commercial users including data centers and industrial users began drinking more deeply from the grid, with annual growth rising 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, residential use only grew by 0.7% annually.

Data centers today consume about 4% of the electricity generated in the United States, more than double their share in 2018. By 2028, consumption is forecasted to rise to 6.7% to 12%, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Generation has managed to meet demand thanks to a surge in new capacity from solar, wind, and grid-scale battery storage. Big tech companies have been inking large deals for new utility-scale solar, in particular, attracted by the energy source’s low cost, modularity, and speed to power. Solar farms can start delivering power to data centers before they’re completed, and a new project typically takes around 18 months to complete.

The EIA expects renewables to dominate new generating capacity through at least the next year. The trend likely would have extended beyond 2026, but experts predict a Republican repeal of key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act will hamper the renewables’ growth.

Meanwhile, natural gas, another source of energy favored by data center operators, hasn’t met the moment. Production has been rising, but most of the new supplies have gone toward feeding exports rather than the domestic market. Consumption by electricity generators rose by 20% between 2019 and 2024, while exporters consumed 140% more.

New natural gas power plants won’t be ready in time, either, since they take around four years to complete, according to the International Energy Agency. A backlog of turbines used by gas-fired power plants has only compounded the problem. Manufacturers are quoting delivery dates up to seven years out, and newly announced production capacity is unlikely to change things.

Slow natural gas buildouts coupled with kneecapped renewables have put data center developers in a bind.

While AI and data centers aren’t entirely responsible for increasing electricity demand — industrial users have been nearly as thirsty — they’ve been leading the headlines.

AI is likely to be the focus of consumers’ ire: More people are concerned about the technology than excited about it, according to a Pew survey. No surprise given that many employers have been wielding the tool as a way to cut headcount rather than improve augment employee productivity.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn’t easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota’s legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,” he said, “and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.”",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/preview-26.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 14:59:06.389085

Across the political spectrum, from grassroots climate campaigners to elite UN negotiators, reducing carbon emissions to avoid future catastrophe has been the organizing logic of climate policies.

Yet climate change has arrived and its material impacts are already being felt. This means that climate politics can no longer focus only on preventing future catastrophes. It must now also encompass struggles over how society manages climate impacts already reshaping economic and social life. Insurance markets, housing, water and land use policies, national labor markets, and local economies – all will need to be radically remade as we adapt to a changed and increasingly volatile climate.

To date, climate adaptation has focused on the environmental impacts of climate change: strengthening seawalls against sea level rise, improving flood control systems, and retrofitting buildings for extreme weather events. But this infrastructure-centric framing sidesteps questions about the institutions that will condition how people experience the political impacts of climate change. Should we allow property insurance markets to operate freely, or should the federal government backstop high-risk regions? Do we maintain disaster aid systems that only protect property owners, or do we guarantee equitable recovery support? Do we leave workers laboring in extreme heat to their employers’ whims, or do we enact federal protections?

These questions are not hypothetical. In the United States alone, a spike in non-renewal rates across the homeowners’ insurance industry – even beyond high-risk markets in Florida and California – indicates that climate threatens to trigger a national insurance crisis. In 2023, UPS workers threatened a nationwide strike over on-the-job heat exposure, ultimately winning an agreement to install air conditioning in delivery trucks. That same year, after decades of drought left the Colorado River’s reservoirs at historic lows – threatening water supplies for 40 million people – the Biden administration paid Arizona, Nevada and California $1.2bn to reduce their water usage. How we respond to these political crises – and those to come – will encode fundamentally different visions of society. Yet these struggles remain largely outside the frame of climate politics, which continues to treat adaptation as a technical matter for experts and engineers rather than genuine political contestation.

Climate politics has already moved beyond technocratic frameworks when it comes to mitigation. Nearly 30 years ago, the Kyoto protocol represented the prevailing wisdom that market mechanisms would solve climate change. But as emissions kept rising and those markets proved ineffectual, the focus shifted to national-level industrial policy debates – and with it, climate became genuinely political. Recent years have seen any number of political battles, spanning the green capitalism of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act versus the democratic socialism of the Green New Deal to debates over lithium nationalization in Bolivia and coal phase-out compensation in Germany. These are fights about values and mediating between competing interests, not merely carbon accounting.

Yet even as climate migrated from the preserve of technocratic elites to more familiar domains of political struggle, it remained restricted to the realm of decarbonization. Even the politically progressive agenda of Zohran Mamdani’s NYC mayoral campaign – which links climate to the cost-of-living crisis, arguing that rent freezes, universal childcare and free public transit will prevent New Yorkers from fleeing for more affordable, but energy-intensive, life in the suburbs – makes its case through an emissions reductions framework. A truly comprehensive climate politics would apply this same political imagination to adaptation – transforming social institutions not only to prevent future warming, but also to manage the climate impacts already transforming everyday life.

The need for this shift becomes clearer once we abandon the apocalyptic framing that has long dominated climate discourse. In insisting that climate change constitutes an all-powerful force that will entirely overwhelm human civilization, climate politics has become blind to the reality that, for most people, climate change will materialize not as something utterly new, but as familiar problems made worse: more people priced out of housing markets after disasters, more workers forced to work during heatwaves, more local industries decimated after extreme weather events. Climate adaptation is not a distinct technical challenge, then, but rather continuous with ongoing political struggles.

The terrain of this struggle is beginning to take shape. The Council on Foreign Relations, for example, recently proposed reforms to the property insurance market to expose homeowners to the “full actuarial cost” of living in high-risk areas like California. By contrast, the progressive Climate and Community Institute has proposed a system of Housing Resilience Agencies that would provide comprehensive public disaster insurance. The contrast is stark: one approach uses price signaling to prod people out of vulnerable areas – effectively a form of managed retreat through market pressure – while the other commits public resources that enable them to stay in place safely. But these kinds of policy debates remain few and far between in climate discourse.

This is not to suggest that mitigation should be abandoned. But the exclusive focus on preventing climate catastrophe obscures a more immediate reality: climate change is already reshaping our world. The question is not whether we will reshape our institutions to manage climate impacts, but how – and whose vision will prevail.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e346b5a70ea30ece8b3d0e4b2f32d0fb3a0bdd22/317_0_3163_2531/master/3163.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1238adda546fc7fd55347aa70aa24775",N,,2025-11-01 13:05:57.468001

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company's agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass' cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass' line crosses his family's land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,"" he said, ""and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.""

(AP) — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn’t easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota’s legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

At the same time, newly forged trade agreements and planned industry investment suggest that some of the current downsizing may be reversed as markets adjust and manufacturers launch new models.

Electric vehicle sales surged in the United States during the third quarter, but with the expiration of federal incentives, automakers have abruptly adjusted their operations in response to changing policy and market conditions. However, industry analysts note that the mounting cutbacks in the sector may prove temporary as new models and consumer incentives change in the coming year.

General Motors, the country's second-largest seller of battery-powered vehicles behind Tesla, began paring back output at its Detroit Factory Zero plant, which produces flagship EV models such as the GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, and Cadillac Escalade IQ.

The assembly line, previously running around the clock on three shifts, was idled for a month and is expected to restart operations next year with only one shift – a move that will leave 1,200 assembly workers without jobs indefinitely. Additional temporary layoffs will affect a further 1,670 workers at GM's battery and components plants in Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee, with the automaker citing evolving market conditions and regulatory shifts for the changes.

GM's joint venture with LG Energy Solution, Ultium Cells, will also pause production at its battery factories in Warren, Ohio, and Spring Hill, Tennessee, resulting in 550 indefinite layoffs and 1,550 temporary layoffs. Earlier this month, GM reported a $1.6 billion charge to reflect the declining value of its EV plants and to cover the costs of layoffs and canceled supplier contracts.

Rivian, the electric truck and SUV manufacturer, has undergone a series of workforce reductions in response to an anticipated sales slowdown. The company recently announced layoffs affecting approximately 600 employees, or around 4.5% of its total workforce.

This follows a smaller round of job cuts one month prior as the company prepares to introduce a new midsize SUV, the R2, expected to start at around $45,000. Rivian reported vehicle sales of 13,201 units in the third quarter, marking a 32% increase year-over-year, but narrowed its delivery guidance for the year from a previous forecast of 46,000 vehicles to a revised range of 41,500 to 43,500 units.

The company lost $1.1 billion in the second quarter but maintains that it has sufficient capital to launch the R2 SUV, anticipating stronger demand for the new vehicle than its current models – the R1T pickup and R1S SUV – which start at $70,990 and $76,900, respectively.

One factor that could help make these cutbacks temporary is the recent trade agreement between the United States and South Korea, which introduces new opportunities and more favorable conditions for EV automakers and suppliers across the global supply chain.

Under the new arrangement, tariffs on Korean autos and auto parts will be reduced from 25% to 15% in exchange for a $350 billion investment commitment from South Korea, structured to avoid destabilizing its currency by capping annual injections at $20 billion over two decades. Of the total, $150 billion will be directed toward American shipbuilding. This deal levels the playing field for South Korean automakers and suppliers, such as Hyundai, LG Energy Solution, and SK, whose business interests in North America depend on fair market access.",https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2025/11/2025-11-01-image.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 16:19:09.933461

When operational, the project will provide 82,000 people with clean, reliable electricity and eliminate 58,740 tons of CO2 emissions per annum.

The approval, comprising $7.27 million from the African Development Bank's own resources, and matching concessional financing from a Development Finance Institution, demonstrates a bold commitment to closing Zambia’s energy gap while advancing the Mission 300 goal of providing 300 million Africans with electricity access by 2030. Zambia is among the first cohort of countries that launched national energy compacts under Mission 300, in January 2025.

The $24.5 million project will design, construct, operate, and maintain the 20 megawatt solar plant, to be connected to the national grid via a 10 km, 33 kV power line. Under a 25-year take-or-pay Power Purchase Agreement, the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited will offtake all electricity generated from the plant.

“The project marks a key milestone in Zambia’s efforts to restore confidence in its power sector, attract private sector investment, and drive progress toward closing the energy gap and achieving Mission 300 goals,” said Wale Shonibare, Director of Energy Financial Solutions, Policy, and Regulation at the African Development Bank.

The Garneton North 20MW Solar Project is one of six projects selected by the Zambia government under the country’s Global Energy Transfer Feed-in Tariffs (GETFiT) programme, designed to unlock private-sector investment in small- and medium-scale renewable energy independent power projects in the country.

It will hire 90 people during construction compromising 5 women and 50 youth, and will hire 10 people during operations, comprising 2 females and 6 youth. The project will add critical capacity to Zambia’s strained power grid, reducing blackouts and improving energy security.

The GETFiT programme approach will facilitate the timely procurement of a total 120 MW of renewable energy capacity; diversify Zambia’s power mix, and demonstrate that Zambia’s power sector is once again bankable for private investment.

“Through the successful implementation of this project and the broader programme, Zambia will demonstrate its strong commitment to diversifying its energy mix away from hydropower and enhancing energy security,” said Jing Li, Division Manager, Energy Financial Solutions at the African Development Bank. “By expanding renewable generation capacity, the project will help reduce the frequency and severity of power outages, ensure a more reliable electricity supply, and contribute to maintaining cost-reflective tariffs for consumers.”

The Garneton North 20MW Solar Project aligns with the African Development Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy (2024–2033), and the New Deal on Energy for Africa, advancing a low-carbon development path and facilitating universal electricity access through clean energy.

Proposition 50 would redraw California’s congressional districts to favor Democrats.

If voters approve it, the number of Republicans representing California in Congress could be cut roughly in half, potentially altering the national balance of power.

Polls show about six in 10 likely voters support the proposition, though support breaks sharply along party lines and varies by region.

Still haven’t decided how you are voting on Prop. 50? Let us help.

The basics

Proposition 50 would change how California determines the boundaries of congressional districts. The measure asks voters to approve new congressional district lines designed to favor Democrats for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections, overriding the map drawn by the state’s nonpartisan, independent redistricting commission.

Impact

If voters approve Proposition 50, Golden State Democrats would see the odds tilted further in their favor, while the number of Republicans representing California in Washington, D.C., could be reduced by half.

Background

With a push from Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democrats in the state Legislature put Proposition 50 on California’s Nov. 4 ballot after the Texas GOP began discussing a new map that would help elect five more Republicans to Congress. The Republican Party holds the House by such a slim margin that any changes to state maps could have an effect on the balance of power in Washington.

How to vote in California’s Nov. 4 special election

Here are some things to know about how to vote in California’s special election on Nov. 4, and where to access more information about the election.

California

Will your congressional district shift left or right in Newsom’s proposed map?

We calculated the margin of victory between Democrats and Republicans in Newsom’s redistricting effort. Here are the results.

Taking sides

Generally speaking, Proposition 50 is marked by a partisan divide.

Some supporters say they will vote for redistricting even though they don’t like it. Instead, they blame Republicans in Texas and elsewhere for gerrymandering to help the GOP. If California didn’t respond, Republicans would get away with stacking the congressional electoral map in their favor. Prop. 50 is backed by topDemocrats nationwide, led by Newsom.

Supporters:

President Barack Obama

Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,. With Prop. 50, you can stop Republicans in their tracks. Prop. 50 puts our elections back on a level playing field, preserves independent redistricting over the long term, and lets the people decide. Return your ballot today.”

-Barack Obama

Opponents

President Donald Trump

Vice President J.D. Vance

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger

Rep. Doug LaMalfa

“They are trying to fight for democracy by getting rid of the democratic principles of California. It is insane to let that happen... They want to dismantle this independent commission. They want to get rid of it under the auspices of we have to fight Trump. It doesn’t make any sense to me because we have to fight Trump, [yet] we become Trump.”

—Arnold Schwarzenegger

Orange County Register: “Prop. 50 tosses aside the congressional maps drawn by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in favor of maps drawn by and for the benefit of politicians. In a healthy democracy, you want voters to be the ones choosing their politicians. With Prop. 50, you have politicians choosing their voters.”

The multimillion-dollar jousting over a redistricting push in California to counter President Trump was on full display recently, as both sides courted voters.

State of the race

Polls

Polls have shown Prop. 50 comfortable leading.

Six in 10 likely voters support Proposition 50, according to a survey by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies that was co-sponsored by The Times. About 38% of likely voters oppose the ballot measure.

According to the survey, the breakdown among voters was highly partisan, with more than 9 out of 10 Democrats supporting Proposition 50 and a similar proportion of Republicans opposing it. Among voters who belong to other parties, or identify as “no party preference,” 57% favored the ballot measure, while 39% opposed it.

In the voter-rich urban areas of Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay area, Proposition 50 led by wide margins, the poll found. Voters in Orange County, the Inland Empire and the Central Valley were pretty evenly divided.

Fundraising

Records show pro-Prop. 50 forces have raised much more money than critics.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s committee supporting the redistricting measure raised $36.8 million between Sept. 21 and Oct. 18, bringing its total to $114.3 million, as of last Thursday.

The two main opposition groups raised a total of $8.4 million during the 28 days covered by the fundraising period, bringing their total haul to $43.7 million.

These compact, three-wheeled vehicles will deliver Coca-Cola products in major cities, including Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar, and Bhopal.
For India, where millions rely on small electric vehicles for daily transport and deliveries, the rollout signals a meaningful shift toward accessible, locally appropriate clean energy solutions.
Environmental experts say scaling up smaller electric vehicles could have an outsized impact in congested urban centers.
Cleaner delivery vehicles mean safer air, quieter neighborhoods, and reduced reliance on dirty fuels.","Coca-Cola's bottling partners in India are taking a cleaner route to customers, one electric rickshaw at a time. According to Electrek, the Coca-Cola company recently announced the addition of more than 5,000 e-rickshaws to its local delivery fleet as part of a wider push to cut pollution and support small-scale entrepreneurs under a program called Vividhta ka Uphaar, which translates to ""a gift of diversity.""

These compact, three-wheeled vehicles will deliver Coca-Cola products in major cities, including Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar, and Bhopal. Powered by small electric drivetrains, the e-rickshaws release zero tailpipe pollution and operate quietly through dense city streets, helping reduce both air and noise pollution for residents. Lower fuel and maintenance costs also make the switch a financial win for local drivers who lease or own their vehicles.

The move puts Coca-Cola among a growing list of global corporations like IKEA, Amazon, and Flipkart, which all use electric tuk-tuks to decarbonize last-mile delivery in Asia. For India, where millions rely on small electric vehicles for daily transport and deliveries, the rollout signals a meaningful shift toward accessible, locally appropriate clean energy solutions.

Environmental experts say scaling up smaller electric vehicles could have an outsized impact in congested urban centers.

As one commenter noted on Electrek's coverage, ""We need millions.""

Another added, ""Throw some solar PV panels on the roof of the warehouse and all of those eTukTuks are powered for the next 30 years!""

While Coca-Cola's investment in electric mobility marks a positive step, the company's environmental record remains far from spotless. It continues to top global rankings as the world's largest producer of branded plastic waste, responsible for billions of bottles each year.

Still, changes like this matter. Cleaner delivery vehicles mean safer air, quieter neighborhoods, and reduced reliance on dirty fuels. It's one way mainstream brands can start supporting sustainable systems from within. This is a move consumers can amplify by supporting eco-friendly initiatives by mainstream brands.

If Coca-Cola's latest rollout proves successful, those thousands of e-rickshaws could become the start of something much larger. In the future, it may not be a fleet measured in thousands, but in millions.

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by four to 546 in the week to October 31, the lowest since September.

Baker Hughes said this week’s decline puts the total rig count down 39 rigs, or 7% below this time last year.

It said oil rigs fell by six to 414 this week, their lowest level since September, while gas rigs rose by four to 125, their highest since August 2023.

FIRMS SHIFT FOCUS AMID LOWER ENERGY PRICES

In Texas, the biggest oil and gas producing state, the rig count fell by one to 235, the lowest since September 2021. In Louisiana, meanwhile, the rig count rose by one to 41, the highest since September 2024.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

The independent exploration and production (E&P) companies tracked by U.S. financial services firm TD Cowen said they planned to cut capital expenditures by around 3% in 2025 from levels seen in 2024.

That compares with roughly flat year-over-year spending in 2024, increases of 27% in 2023, 40% in 2022, and 4% in 2021.

US EIA PROJECTED HIGHER OUTPUT

Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third year in a row in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to around 13.5 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, EIA projected a 56% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020.

EIA projected gas output would rise to 107.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

We saw that DAC involves the pulling in of large amounts of air using giant fans or pumps, which is then passed through chemicals. The chemicals react with air in such a manner that carbon dioxide is trapped, and the other air is released. This pure stream of carbon dioxide is then carried to underground reservoirs for storage. We also saw that DAC is a highly capital-intensive process and requires a steady supply of green energy for it to be meaningful. There are very few such operational projects at the moment, with many being planned. The main operational DAC project in the world is the Climeworks project in Iceland: the Orca plant and the Mammoth project. The Heirloom Plant in California is also operational, but is much smaller than the Climeworks plants. The South Texas Hub and the Project Cypress Hub in Louisiana are being planned in the USA on a much larger scale, but the progress on these is uncertain after the election of President Trump as the President of the USA. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that there are 27 DAC projects in the world, and another 130 projects are in various stages of planning. Most of the DAC plants under operation are small operations. Let us discuss the operational DAC projects.

Climeworks’ Iceland DAC Plants

There are two DAC plants located near the Hellisheidi geothermal plant: the smaller Orca plant, which can remove 4,000 tonnes of CO2 per year and the Mammoth plant, which can remove 36,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The Mammoth plant was commissioned in May 2024. The location of Iceland is not coincidental: it has been carefully chosen because of a steady supply of green geothermal energy. Further, the Mammoth plant is situated near a dormant volcano, which provides large storage space for the CO2 captured. The storage partner of Climeworks is a company called Carbfix, which injects the carbon dioxide into deep basalt rocks, where it gets converted into carbonate minerals and stored for over 10,000 years. In the words of the co-founder of Climeworks, Christophe Gribald, they intend to capture one Megaton of CO2 per year by 2030 and one Gigaton by 2050.

The smaller Orca plant was commissioned in September 2021 and can remove 4,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.

The DAC plants of Climeworks have been successful in both raising funds for their operations and finding customers for the green carbon credits they have created. Their funding came from a variety of sources, ranging from GIC of Singapore to private equity firms such as Partners Group and BigPoint Holdings. Their earliest customers were two European Airlines: Swiss Air and Lufthansa, and they quickly expanded to include Microsoft, BCG, JP Morgan, and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines.

DAC Plants under Development

Most of the large plants under development are in the USA and have been planned in pursuance of a USD 3.5 billion grant to develop DAC hubs under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Stratos DAC Plant, Texas: Developed by 1Point Five (USA) and Carbon Engineering (Canada), this facility will remove 5,00,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually, becoming the world’s largest DAC plant, once operational.

South Texas DAC Hub: Also by 1Point Five, this Kleberg County project mirrors Stratos’ design, targeting 5,00,000 tonnes yearly with plans for 3 billion tonnes of long-term storage.

Norway DAC Projects: Norway, with its large supply of renewable energy, is developing into a large DAC hub in the world. Three large projects being planned are: the Carbon Engineering and Oxy Low Carbon Ventures (OLCV) project in the Koollsnes area, with a capacity to remove 5,00,000 to one million tonnes of CO2 per year, the Climeworks project with Northern Lights infrastructure and the Removr plant with a capacity to remove one million tonnes of CO2 per year.

Project Cypress Hub, Louisiana: This hub is being developed by the US Department of Energy at two locations in Louisiana: Calcasieu Parish near Vinton (will use Climeworks’ technology) and Caddo Parish at the Port of Caddo-Bossier (will use Heirloom’s technology), to remove one million tonnes of CO2 per year when operational.

Conclusion

Direct Air Capture is an important technological intervention and should be a part of the strategy across the world to achieve net-zero emissions. While it is highly capital-intensive and costly at the moment, costs are likely to fall as more and more plants become operational.",https://www.millenniumpost.in/h-upload/2025/11/01/997924-carban.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 15:59:53.860936

It’s investing that money at Sanford’s Helix Innovation Park at the Brickyard. The company expects to create 102 jobs at the Lee County site. Add N.C. Department of Commerce incentives worth $2 million over 12 years and local incentives approved by Sanford City Council and Lee County Board of Commissioners, and the project is expected to grow the state’s economy by more than $1 billion, according to a news release.

The Kyowa Kirin project represents more than a single economic development win. “It will be a showcase for industry, not just from Lee but from Chatham and Harnett counties as well,” says Sanford Area Growth Alliance CEO Jimmy Randolph. “You’ll be able to see the manufacturing that’s happening here. It’s going to be a cornerstone of our workforce in North Carolina.”

Nestled together in North Carolina’s center, Chatham, Harnett and Lee counties have more than boundaries in common. Residents cross those lines regularly for work and play. They share utilities, including electricity and water. And their future, economic and otherwise, will be determined by their efforts, whether they’re done individually or collectively.

BUILDING A WORKFORCE

Central Carolina Community College has three campuses. Their reach is extended with instructional locations — seven in Lee, four in Chatham and nine in Harnett. “[It’s] more than an educational institution,” says Margaret Roberton, CCCC vice president of workforce development and chief of staff. “It is a vital component of economic development in the region and a trusted partner for businesses across Chatham, Harnett and Lee counties. CCCC’s deep connections to local industry make it a critical force in building a skilled workforce, supporting business retention and driving regional prosperity. The college’s impact extends beyond the classroom. CCCC collaborates closely with regional and local economic development organizations — Carolina Core, RTRP, SAGA, Chatham EDC and Harnett EDC — chambers of commerce, workforce boards and local governments to attract new industry and strengthen existing businesses.”

Harnett County Economic Development Director Stephen Barrington says CCCC may be the three-county region’s greatest asset. The best one specifically for industry may be the college’s 22-acre E. Eugene Moore Manufacturing and Biotech Solutions Center in Sanford.

Renovations to Moore Center’s 10,000-square-foot biotechnology building will make room for program expansions intended to support the region’s blossoming biotechnology industry. A “wall breaking” ceremony kicked off the work in September. “The building will contain clean room experiences, fill-finish labs, BioWork classrooms and a high flexible lab designed to shift with industry needs, among other learning spaces,” Roberton says. “This building will support individuals entering into the industry in areas of process technician and quality as well as upskilling the existing workforce as they progress through their careers.”

Kyowa Kirin joins manufacturers Pfizer and Astellas in providing input for renovations and designing future training efforts at the Moore Center. “The college through a mix of county, state and private funds has committed $32.1 million toward current renovation efforts, which include the biotechnology building and Phase 1 of the manufacturing building,” Roberton says. “We are working on a capital campaign leveraging both public and private funds for the $72 million needed to complete the full renovation of the center. We are inviting a number of area manufacturers for input on Phase 1 of the larger building as well as early design efforts for Phase 2.”

Phase 2 addresses the balance of approximately 175,000 square feet of the main building. “[It’s] focused on ensuring that relevant advanced manufacturing training is offered as well as holding space for partnerships and unique solution opportunities responding to manufacturing needs,” according to CCCC. “Training areas will include welding, industrial systems, automation, engineering technologies, computer-integrated machining, advanced materials/energy and the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies.”

The Moore Center is home to several programs. Robertson says the commercial drivers’ license division, is parked there, offering hands-on instruction for people pursuing this high-demand field. Other workforce development initiatives are underway elsewhere. Barrington says Harnett County has invested in CCCC’s Liftoff Lab program, funding multiple scholarships per year. The program is led by the college’s Small Business Center, which in partnership with the Sanford Area Growth Alliance and Downtown Sanford created Real Investment in Sanford Entrepreneurs in 2021.

CCCC has several new programs. FirstHealth FirstFutures is a healthcare workforce partnership with FirstHealth of the Carolinas and other community colleges. AdvanceNC is a collaboration of 12 community colleges, seven workforce development boards, three universities and two nonprofit partners that intends to create a more aligned and responsive workforce ecosystem for the advanced manufacturing sector. And Commercial Leap Ahead for Wide bandgap Semiconductors — CLAWS — works with NC State and N.C. A&T to respond to the national need for a skilled workforce in microelectronics and semiconductors.

CCCC is prepared for a variety of assignments. “From advanced manufacturing and life sciences to clean energy and healthcare, CCCC is at the table for industry recruitment and expansion conversations, ensuring companies know they will have access to the talent they need to grow and thrive,” Roberton says. “These efforts include innovative efforts to include employers in meaningful conversations about workforce needs from inviting employers to help design training environments to establishing Business & Industry Leadership Teams to provide industry direct connections into helping the college align our educational delivery to their current and future workforce needs.”

SHARED SERVICES

Chatham, Harnett and Lee counties share a workforce, trading commuters every morning and evening. “Our three counties are uniquely part of two distinct economic development regions in the state — Research Triangle and the Carolina Core,” Barrington says. “Areas in which each of our counties will actively work to uncover solutions include affordable housing, which differentiates from low-income housing; power, including use of alternative sources; and childcare, its scarcity and affordability.”

Barrington says more than half of Harnett residents leave the county for work. The county launched its Harnett County Jobs Campaign in January, hoping to spur 1,000 new jobs at or above 125% of the county average annual wage, which state data shows is $46,969, by the end of 2030. “We know this will not make a real dent in the 39,000, or net loss of 20,000, that leave the county every day to go to work,” he says. “But it is a focused start.”

Randolph says other parameters direct job creation in the counties. “We have to also consider our partnership with [Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina] and their interest in larger projects like in life sciences, energy related and, as the uncertainty around tariffs continues, we see projects that may be interested in onshoring manufacturing. The challenge is power and access to adequate power infrastructure.”

Central Electric Membership Corp. serves Chatham, Harnett, Lee, Moore and Randolph counties. “We need 20 to 50 megawatts for advanced manufacturing that may be heavily automated, and it’s putting some significant challenges to our partners on the utilities side to meet those needs,” Randolph says. “That’s going to be part of the story of economic development in the future. Some data center projects think central North Carolina would be a great place, but we don’t have the electrical capacity to support that. Some centers need potentially hundreds of megawatts, and that’s unprecedented in our area for a single

end user.”

The availability of other utilities can be hurdles, too. TriRiver Water serves Chatham, Lee and parts of Orange counties. It formed in July 2024, when Sanford and the town of Pittsboro in Chatham County merged their water services. Siler City in Chatham County joined a year later. “If you’re thinking about regionality in economic development, you’re now seeing how small systems are not adequate,” Randolph says. “And I think Sanford is going to be a model for the state, where we look at a more regional approach. TriRiver Water is making significant investments to connect all those cities and will move to a 30-million-gallon-per-day capacity. That’s critical for our larger businesses.”

Chatham County Economic Development President Michael Smith underscored the importance of adequate water supply to projects. “TriRiver Water is a key player in supporting our community across the county, from the Triangle Innovation Point megasite in Moncure to the Chatham Advanced Manufacturing site in Siler City,” he says. “From regional water infrastructure to industrial site development, our partnerships are fueling opportunity and shaping the future of Chatham County.”

MIXING WORK AND PLAY

Chatham County has water views. “Jordan Lake is the most visited state park in North Carolina,” Smith says. “And that’s exciting, because it’s right here in our county. It’s a beautiful body of water with zero development along its shores.” Chatham also has upscale housing developments, including one owned by Disney, and tourist attractions such as Carolina Tiger Rescue, a nonprofit wildlife sanctuary near Pittsboro.

Smith says Chatham has strong relationships with its neighboring counties. “And we’re fortunate to be part of both the RTP Regional Partnership and the Carolina Core,” he says. “These connections give us the advantage of collaboration and the support of regional marketing groups that help us share our story.” It has a whole chapter dedicated to business parks, including Triangle Innovation Point and Chatham-Siler City Advance Manufacturing, which has 1,300 acres available.

Apex Gateway has six completed buildings, which total more than 1 million square feet, and additional space is under construction. Tenants include Durham Coca-Cola Bottling, US Autoforce, Emcor and Life Sciences Logistics. “Through our partnership with Apex Economic Development, we are marketing the Apex Gateway site, which will offer over 1 million square feet of industrial space at the U.S. 64/N.C. 751 intersection,” Smith says.

Chatham County EDC opened a satellite office at 79°West Innovation Hub, a 22,000-square-foot workspace and 8,500-square-foot warehouse in MOSAIC, a 44-acre mixed-use community in the live-work-play-learn community of Chatham Park, just north of downtown Pittsboro. “MOSAIC’s 79°West Innovation Hub keeps creating community with innovative programming and by becoming home to small businesses, including the Chatham EDC and the Chatham Chamber,” says Kirk Bradley, the developer of MOSAIC at Chatham Park. “More guests than ever are attending MOSAIC events, including concerts, markets, wellness Wednesdays and more. And Hampton Inn & Suites is bustling with both business and wedding party traffic.”

MOSAIC includes businesses, restaurants, apartments, an outdoor concert venue and a hotel. “[It’s] alive with activity, whether that’s community events on the Philip H. Kohl MOSAIC Family Commons or a tenant’s grand opening,” Bradley says. “We’ve added multiple new services, like Foundations Family Therapy and barre3 Chatham Park, and look forward to welcoming a new restaurant, a Tavolo Italian Eatery from local restauranteur Greg Lewis.”

Vanessa Jenkins is executive vice president of Cary-based Preston Development, which created the district. “Chatham Park is a unique community where residents can put down roots and work in a variety of locations,” she says. “We are convenient to megasites, the city of Sanford as well as Hartnett County. There are also many employment opportunities within Chatham Park as well. Various development projects are underway within Chatham Park, several of which will provide services and residential offerings for years to come. Grading of the UNC Health Campus, phase one of Asteria, StoryLiving by Disney, the extension of Chatham Parkway to connect Highway 64 and 15/501 have all broken ground this year.”

MOSAIC has plenty to offer. “[It’s] an attractive spot for businesses to locate, because it’s a mixed-use development, where community members can live, work, learn, play and dine all in one place in the growing community of Pittsboro,” Bradley says. “In short, the momentum at MOSAIC continues to add to Chatham County’s growing energy.”

MAKING ROOM FOR BUSINESS

Harnett’s population is about 146,000, 25% more than in 2010. That increase has been noticed.“Private developers are now circling the county and plan to bring to the market new shopping centers with top tier grocery store anchors,” Barrington says. “Harnett County has also invested in a relationship with Retail Strategies out of Birmingham, Alabama, to help attract national brands within the retail, restaurant and hospitality space.”

Truck equipment manufacturer Godwin Manufacturing, a $30 million Rooms to Go expansion, doors and turnstiles manufacturer Boon Edam, grocery chain Carlie C’s IGA and Warren Oil Co., are big blocks in Harnett’s economic foundation. The search for room to add more is underway. Product development — buildings and land — is Harnett County Economic Development’s focus. “Product development is all about ‘setting the table’ for new and expanding companies,” Barrington says. The county is working to identify buildings and land suitable for manufacturing and professional/business services and transitioning available land to market-ready sites. He says Harnett’s first Class A industrial park, Harnett 95 Industrial Center, will have approximately 800,000 square feet of industrial building space.

Harnett wants a high-level presence in manufacturing, retail, professional and business services and health care. “Cape Fear Valley Health continues to grow in Harnett County,” Barrington says. “Over the last year, they added a 60,000-square-foot facility at their Lillington campus that included a cancer treatment center. They are currently constructing an Adolescent Behavioral Health Center on the same campus.”

EXPANDING DEVELOPMENT

Kyowa Kirin’s impact goes beyond its factory and CCCC. Randolph says Sanford Area Growth Alliance worked with local developer James Goodnight Jr. to create office space inside the former Capital Bank Building, one of eight properties he owns in downtown Sanford. “And they’ve moved 55 of their employees there,” Randolph says. “So, we will have that live-work-play atmosphere going on downtown.”

Goodnight’s other downtown buildings are undergoing repairs and renovations. Downtown Sanford Inc. Executive Director Kelli Laudate says the Kimbrell’s Furniture Store is being repurposed into 10 market-rate apartments with three to four ground-floor spaces for retail. “Nearby, another building on South Steele Street is under renovation and will soon provide two additional opportunities for retail or restaurant tenants,” she says. “Both projects are expected to be completed by spring 2026. Sanford is fortunate to benefit from Mr. Goodnight’s investment and leadership as he brings not only a strong vision for downtown development but also a deep appreciation for historic preservation.”

The downtown Pilgrim’s Sanford Agricultural Marketplace is expected to open in the spring. It will be a regional hub for farmers and artisans and partner with N.C. Cooperative Extension for workshops, cooking classes and demonstrations on food preservation. A commercial kitchen will support local food-based businesses.

Travel 2 miles from downtown Sanford, and you’ll find Riverbirch Shopping Center in an underserved corner of the city. In late September, Sanford City Council approved $4.4 million in incentives for Ohio-based Casto to redevelop the center, which is expected to include a Target and regional grocery store by 2030. The $64 million project aims to revive the former retail hub and marks Target’s first Lee County location.

Laudate says work on Kyowa Kirin’s office space was completed earlier this year. It signified something bigger than a place to put desks, chairs and workers. “What’s most important is the broader impact,” she says. “Bringing Kyowa Kirin downtown not only anchors a global company in Sanford but also strengthens the city’s ability to attract future industries to establish offices in the heart of downtown.” ■

WILD MEETINGS

Carolina Tiger Rescue gives large and wild cats a better life. It helps local companies and student groups build unity and give back.

East of Pittsboro off U.S. 64 is Carolina Tiger Rescue, a 67-acre sanctuary that’s gaining favor with local businesses, which bring their staff for outdoor getaways. Cisco employees, for example, had visited 14 times this year as of late September. Employees from Deutsche Bank, Epic Games, Google, Lenovo, MetLife, SAS and Whole Foods have visited, along with sororities and fraternities from Duke University, NC State and UNC Chapel Hill. “It’s like a team building exercise for them,” says Kris Marino, Carolina Tiger Rescue executive director. “I worked for big nonprofits for a long time, and team building is a big thing. They’re getting a day out, and they have a way to give back.”

Marino says the sanctuary welcomed more than 1,000 workgroup volunteers last year. They represented almost 100 companies and universities and contributed nearly 4,500 hours to sanctuary care and maintenance. “We are on track to reach similar numbers in 2025,” she says.

Volunteers help construct enclosures, work on roads, mow grass or do any other outdoor task that needs to be completed. Some bring donations or wish-list items such as paper towels. “We just appreciate them coming and helping out with projects,” Marino says.

Carolina Tiger Rescue is home to 55 animals — tigers, lions, servals, cougars, caracals, kinkajous, bobcats, coatimundis, raccoons and porcupines. They live in spacious enclosures that replicate their natural habitat. Most come from traveling circuses, mom-and-pop zoos or private owners. “Some of our residents have been confiscated by authorities,” Marino says. “You cannot [privately] own a large cat anymore. It’s illegal. But you can own a wild cat like a bobcat [in four states, including North Carolina]. We actually have a bobcat that was owned by someone, and when she reached the age and size where she was no longer a kitten … well, she lives here now. We have a lot of caracals that people thought were cute, but at the end of the day, they’re wild animals.”

Everyone who enters Carolina Tiger Rescue requires a staff escort. The sanctuary offers public and private tours, school field trips, a middle school homeschool program and internships. Tours provide an opportunity to educate people about the animals and their rescue stories.

“From an economic perspective, those who travel here, they buy gas, they buy meals and they spend money in Chatham County,” Marino says.

“We hope to have more tours and educate more people. For everyone who works here, it’s a labor of love. It’s a great job. We have about 22,000 visitors a year. Our goal here is to educate.”

Marino moved to Chatham County in December 2020, and she toured Carolina Tiger Rescue the next month. “My favorite animal was the massive tiger who greeted you when you went on tour,” she says. “I walked in and saw him, and I immediately knew I needed to work with Carolina Tiger Rescue somehow. The tiger’s name was Caprichio, and he was a big boy. He weighed 489 pounds. I started working as a volunteer. He’s what made me want to stay.”

Caprichio was born in 2010 and rescued in 2016 from a roadside zoo in Colorado. His hind legs were injured, and his back was bowed from metabolic bone disease. Carolina Tiger Rescue provided medical care and a home. A staff favorite, he learned to appreciate human help and spent hot summer days splashing in his pool. He died in October 2023.

Marino heads a 22-person staff. She says their affection for the animals is continual. “We have a memorial garden, and we have a ceremony,” she says, alluding to Caprichio’s service. “It’s very emotional. Everyone who works here loves animals.”

Carolina Tiger Rescue has 12 acres where it will build a visitor’s center and educational building. D&G Community Development, a national organization that works with nonprofits, is organizing a capital campaign, and Carolina Tiger Rescue has fundraising links on its Facebook page and website. An architect and engineering firm are onboard, and Marino is working with local officials. “We probably are going to have our groundbreaking on the new 16,000-sqare-foot building in 2026,” she says. ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NovCC_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 11:20:53.232040

Together, with North Valley Thrive and Opportunity Stanislaus, the San Joaquin Partnership welcomed leaders from across California to experience, first-hand, the innovation, collaboration, and economic potential that define our region.

The summit opened with three regional tours designed to showcase local strengths and innovations in clean energy, local restoration efforts, the bioeconomy, and advanced manufacturing — including an Aviation C Innovation Tour that highlighted the exciting industries shaping the Valley’s economic future. These experiences set the tone for a conference that celebrated progress rooted in partnership and regional leadership.

Among the highlights of the week were remarks from Gov. Gavin Newsom, who underscored California’s commitment to regional economic collaboration and inclusive growth, and a governor’s candidate forum featuring four candidates discussing their visions for the state’s future. These sessions reinforced the importance of sustained investment and engagement in California’s diverse regions.

I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Mayor Christina Fugazi for her leadership and hospitality throughout the summit. Her presence and engagement underscored Stockton’s commitment to collaboration and growth. Appreciation is also due to Vice Mayor Jason Lee, the Stockton City Council, and Assemblymember Rhodesia Ransom for their continued partnership and advocacy on behalf of our region.

A special thank-you to Chief Stanley McFadden and Officer Richard Buckley of the Stockton Police Department Air Unit for the national anthem helicopter flyover at the regional reception — a moment that captured our community’s pride and professionalism. Appreciation also goes to Chief Bryan Carr and the Stockton Fire Department for their support in helping us close the event with a spectacular fireworks display at Banner Island Ballpark.

The summit was far more than a three-day conference. It was an opportunity to highlight the North San Joaquin Valley’s growing role in shaping California’s economic future. Thanks to the hard work of the San Joaquin Partnership team, iHub San Joaquin, and the San Joaquin Community Foundation, along with our sponsors — Valley Strong Credit Union, A.G. Spanos Companies, American Medical Response (AMR), California Strawberry Commission, Collins Electric, CSU Stanislaus, the Reinvent Stockton Foundation, and California Water Service — we delivered a powerful message: Our region is open for business, full of talent, and ready to lead.

Not often do we have the chance to tell our story on such a large stage. This milestone event marked a proud moment, not just for Stockton, but for the entire North San Joaquin Valley. It showcased our capacity to lead, to partner, and reminded everyone that our region is resilient and full of promise.

As we look ahead, the San Joaquin Partnership remains focused on building on this momentum and attracting investment, fostering innovation, and creating pathways for shared prosperity.

To all who contributed to this success, thank you for representing our community with pride. Together, we showed that when Stockton shows up, we shine.

The Trump administration’s emergency order to keep the huge J.H. Campbell coal plant on Lake Michigan operating past its planned retirement date has cost at least $80 million since May, its operator, Consumers Energy, told regulators and investors this week.

The company said in its third-quarter earnings report Thursday that it would pursue the process laid out in the U.S. Department of Energy’s order for collecting those costs: It will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest.

Even though the peak summer electricity demand season has passed, executives at Consumers, Michigan’s largest energy provider, said that they see no sign of let-up in the emergency orders.

“We expect those to continue for the long-term,” said CEO Garrick Rochow in a conference call for investors. “And we’re prepared to continue to operate the plant and comply with those orders.”

He said the costs—$615,385 per day—should be shared beyond the 1.9 million electricity customers of Consumers Energy. The company plans to propose the tab be split among ratepayers (an estimated 42 million to 45 million electricity customers) in the nine states served by the regional electric grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).

“The benefits go to MISO,” Rochow said. “Not just to our customers, they go to MISO.”

Rochow said the Trump administration envisioned this approach. “That order from the Department of Energy has laid out a clear path to cost recovery,” he said. Consumers Energy will have to apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in order to pass the costs to the ratepayers, and states that oppose such a cost allocation could move to intervene in those proceedings.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued two consecutive 90-day orders—on May 23 and on Aug. 20—to keep the Campbell plant open under the emergency provisions of the Federal Power Act. In the past, such orders have been used to ensure energy delivery at times of natural disasters. But Wright used the act to execute Trump’s agenda to ramp up energy production, saying Campbell needed to stay open to minimize the risk of power outages and address critical grid security issues in the Midwest.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Campbell cost figures, nor did MISO. When he extended the Campbell order in August, Wright said that he was directing MISO “to take every step to minimize cost to the American people.”

“This order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power,” he said in that statement.

But critics say the operation of the 63-year-old plant is generating unnecessary costs as well as pollution. In a September regulatory filing challenging the DOE’s order, a coalition of environmental groups pointed out that even on the day of highest peak demand this summer, MISO had an unused surplus of resources greater than 10 times the power provided by the Campbell plant.

And indeed, according to recent Environmental Protection Agency data, two of the three units at the Campbell plant were not operating at all for about 30 days of the 131 days from the start of the DOE order through Sept. 30. The third unit at the plant only ran for 18 days. Such stoppages could occur for maintenance or simply because the grid operator did not call on the plant to deliver energy to the grid.

“Forcing this unnecessary coal plant to keep operating is bilking consumers for the benefit of the coal industry,” said Michael Lenoff, senior attorney for Earthjustice, which is representing the environmental groups.

Because DOE did not respond to their petition for reconsideration of the Campbell order within 30 days, the environmental groups and the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois have asked the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case. The purpose of the litigation, Lenoff said, is “to stop the administration from harming consumers, trampling markets and unlawfully usurping the authority of states and regulators to make decisions in the public interest.”

Campbell is by far the largest of three fossil fuel electricity plants that are staying open beyond their planned retirements under Trump administration emergency orders. Campbell released 6.6 million metric tons of carbon in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. Talen Energy’s Wagner plant near Baltimore and Constellation Energy’s Eddystone plant just south of Philadelphia, both run on oil and natural gas. Some detail on their costs for keeping open may emerge next week, when Talen and Constellation report their third-quarter earnings.

Consumers Energy, which is continuing to work toward its previously stated goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, had projected that the retirement of the Campbell plant would save its customers $600 million over the next 20 years, or $30 million per year. Instead, running the plant for the past five months has cost close to three times that annual amount.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-1-1024x6001762002510.jpg?h=e8f379d2&itok=D-NxR1-J,N,,2025-11-01 12:07:19.588763

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me. As I say in the Sunday videos over on Take Two, I hope you’re well, safe, and with someone you care about who also cares for you.

We start today’s show in Tokyo, where the Japan Mobility Show took place this week.

The event featured a range of new vehicles and concept teases — including BYD’s first Kei car for Japan, the all-electric BYD Racco, powered by a 20-kilowatt-hour LFP battery pack. Japanese brands also leaned into EVs, with Toyota previewing the next-generation Corolla as a hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and full EV. It also unveiled the IMV Origin EV, a modular skateboard platform, and several HiAce EV concepts. Nissan debuted its solar roof for the Sakura EV, promising up to thirty miles of range per day from solar alone. And Honda introduced two standouts: the Honda 0 Alpha crossover and the Super-One Prototype — a sportier N-One with a body kit, simulated engine noise, and gear shifts — headed for production in Japan, the UK, and select markets next year.

The U.S. administration’s shifting stance on green energy and transportation continues to send shockwaves worldwide.

This week, Manager Magazin in Germany reported that the Volkswagen Group plans up to twelve billion euros in cost cuts next year, largely due to changing U.S. demand and weak EV sales in other markets. U.S. production of the ID.4 is expected to remain paused for a significant period, while future imports to the U.S. remain uncertain. Meanwhile, GM extended layoffs, cutting three thousand three hundred staff across Factory Zero in Detroit, its Ohio Ultium facility, and its Ultium plant in Tennessee. While these layoffs are temporary until early next year, GM blames the “evolving regulatory environment.” In other words, President Trump—a man so anti-EV he thinks magnets stop working when wet and wants aircraft carriers to return to “steam-powered” lifts—continues to shape U.S. policy.

And if that story wasn’t enough bad news, Ford added to it this week by officially confirming its F150 Lightning production facility is shuttered until further notice.

You might assume this is simply a sales-driven reduction, but the real reason is different: Ford’s key aluminum supplier, Novelis, suffered a massive factory fire a few weeks ago, creating a shortage of the metal used in all F150s. For now, Ford says it is prioritizing its available aluminum for internal combustion and hybrid F150s. Financially, it makes sense—the internal combustion F150 is Ford’s largest seller—but the company also claims that model uses less aluminum per truck than the Lightning. Still, it’s disappointing given that the F150 Lightning was the U.S.’s best-selling electric pickup last quarter. Ford can do better.

No matter how many times you try to bust EV myths, someone, somewhere is always ready to jump into a comment section or Reddit thread to tell you just how wrong you are.

One of the most persistent myths is that EV battery packs will require replacement after a few years, posing a threat to anyone buying a used EV. For those who enjoy a little FUD-busting, new data from Swedish used-car marketplace Kvdbil examined the health of battery packs in over one thousand three hundred used plug-in vehicles—more than half battery electric—and found that eighty percent retained more than ninety percent of their original capacity, though odometer readings weren’t reported. The EVs showing the least degradation were the Kia EV6, Kia e-Niro, Tesla Model Y, and Opel Mokka-e. The Mazda MX-30 also ranked well, likely because its low volume and short range mean high-mileage examples are extremely rare, making degradation unlikely.

Despite automakers’ efforts to the contrary, Europe is on track to ban the sale of new internal‑combustion‑engine vehicles from twenty thirty-five onwards.

As part of that shift, plug‑in hybrids—which still carry combustion engines—are also slated for phase-out. While they can drive in EV mode, studies show that in everyday use they often become heavy polluters once the battery’s range is exhausted, since their engines rarely warm up properly. Now Germany’s VDA (the German Association of the Automotive Industry) is proposing a built-in charging obligation for plug‑in hybrids, requiring regular charging in exchange for EU approval to sell them beyond twenty thirty-five. The measure is pitched as giving long-distance drivers flexibility while ensuring EV-mode use most of the time—but the words “relic” and “bygone age” come to mind.

As a triple citizen of the UK, the U.S., and Canada, I’ve watched as two of those countries have made my life harder—while the other has tried to make smarter choices about our future.

If you’re in the U.S. or Canada, you’ve probably seen the kerfuffle this week after Doug Ford, Premier of Ontario, green‑lit an ad on U.S. TV during the World Series, critical of U.S. tariffs on Canada and using excerpts from a Ronald Reagan speech. In retaliation, Donald Trump cut off trade negotiations and ramped up tariffs on all Canadian products. But Canada might have the last laugh: Prime Minister Mark Carney is reportedly considering removing all import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, potentially paving the way for automakers like BYD to sell there. While safety standards and regulations remain hurdles, continued U.S. antagonism could push Canada to adopt European—or its own—standards, shaking up the North American EV market. Good job, Canada—this could be game-changing!

Sticking with Canada, Nissan Canada has announced a partnership with Quebec-based Lithion Technologies to establish end-of-life EV battery recycling in the country.

Through the partnership, Nissan will use Lithion’s hydrometallurgical techniques to recover up to ninety-five percent of critical battery materials and ninety-eight percent of key minerals from used Nissan EV packs. Meanwhile, Japanese newspaper Nikkei reported this week that Nissan is preparing for scale production of commercial solid-state battery packs in its 2028 financial year, which runs from April to March. Details are sparse, but the paper claims Nissan is targeting double the volumetric energy density of its current lithium-ion technology—meaning that, if successful, Nissan could regain its long-lost position as one of the world’s leading EV manufacturers.

With automakers around the world seemingly less enthusiastic about Evs than they once were – and many news outlets doing the rest of the work to claim nobody wants EVs – good, solid sales data is always welcome to bust that bubble.

This week, the European automaker association ACEA released data from its members showing one hundred sixty-seven thousand five hundred eighty-six electric cars sold in September across the EU—twenty percent higher than the same month last year.

So far in 2025, just over one point three million EVs have been registered on European roads, representing a sixteen point one percent market share. Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands led the charge, while France saw another slight year-over-year drop, continuing a trend from the previous quarter. Although the ACEA—which has historically pushed back against ICE bans—notes that these figures fall short of what’s needed to fully transition the fleet to electric, it’s encouraging to see steady growth.

While our earlier story on battery degradation should give used EV owners more confidence, LG Energy Solution in South Korea has just launched a new service to ease fears even further.

Enter the B.Once service: it promises customers a quick five-minute state-of-health readout for a potential new-to-them EV, with a longer one-hour test providing more granular insights into the battery pack’s condition. The service is currently limited to South Korean cars with LG Energy Solution battery packs, and Revolt—a platform for used EVs—has already signed on. Meanwhile, in Europe, digital used EV marketplace Aampere secured one point six million euros this week to help expand its platform. It uses AI algorithms to evaluate vehicles being sold privately or professionally on the used market.

The current… Dear Leader of the U.S. hates wind turbines with a passion—especially offshore ones. While his Department of Energy and allies on Capitol Hill slow U.S. wind farm development, the rest of the world is charging ahead.

New data from think tank Ember, working with the Global Offshore Wind Alliance, shows that outside the U.S., offshore wind has never been stronger. Dozens of countries, subnational governments, and regions now have twenty-thirty offshore wind targets that together point to roughly two hundred and sixty gigawatts of capacity by the end of the decade. Yet the report cautions that many jurisdictions could miss their targets unless permitting and supply-chain hurdles are addressed. Many European countries are already on track, while the U.S. is lagging. Don’t count the U.S. out, though: some states have set their own targets and are actively working to pick up the slack left by the previous administration’s abandoned plans. I bet the White House did Nat-zee that coming—probably too busy targeting people in inflatable frog costumes.

What I bet you saw coming is today’s sponsor, Energy Sage – who can help those of you in the U.S. green your home energy and build energy independence, without any fossil fuels.

We’re now officially done with our Autumnal Patreon drive—but I want to thank everyone who signed up during September and October, and remind those who haven’t yet that there’s still plenty of reasons to support this channel at Patreon.com/TransportEvolved!

We’ve been making EV content for fifteen years, ten of those in the U.S., always aiming to be independent and impartial. We’re not backed by corporations or big production budgets. Our tiny team—three full-time and one part-time member—works hard every week to bring you well-researched, honest content.

In a landscape where YouTube is overtly silencing diverse, independent voices and avoiding many minority groups entirely—while highlighting clickbait and AI fluff above real content—ad revenue is falling even when view counts aren’t. Your support helps pay bills, health insurance, retirement, and keeps the content coming.

Next month, our annual broadcast insurance bill is due—something only people who operate as journalists need. It protects us if we ever report on a company or automaker who takes issue with our coverage—a situation I personally experienced once while still at another firm. The cost is five thousand dollars. Last week, we had to replace our wireless microphone packs and mics after five years of hard service. The new gear is AMAZING—thank you—but it set us back two thousand five hundred dollars.

Even though the Autumn drive is over, consider joining the several thousand folx already supporting us. You help me avoid sleepless nights and allow us to expand onto other platforms like PeerTube without relying solely on YouTube. And if you already do—thank you.

And now… it’s time for those last two stories.

Electric bicycles have gone from curiosity to mainstream in record time—and what counts as an eBike can vary wildly depending on where you live.

That’s causing headaches for lawmakers, especially in the U.S., where patchwork local rules and lax federal guidance mean some eBikes can outperform mopeds. The result: more collisions, pedestrian incidents, and reckless riding. In Florida, a Republican lawmaker has proposed a draft bill to curb e-bike recklessness. It would ban anyone under sixteen from riding electric motorcycles or scooters over seven hundred and fifty watts, require e-bikes and e-scooters to yield to pedestrians and use audible signals when passing, mandate crash reporting, and require a driver’s license or permit for Class 3 e-bikes with assisted speeds up to twenty-eight miles per hour. The highest-specced bikes—think Sur Ron—would be classified as electric motorcycles. Hopefully, the rules curb danger without penalizing lower-power eBikes, as responsibly ridden low-power e-bikes can dramatically improve health outcomes while lowering congestion and pollution.

Most hardened EV fans know the EV1—General Motors’ first production EV, a sleek two-seater leased to select U.S. customers at the turn of the century.

Nearly all EV1s, along with contemporaries like the RAV4 EV, Ford Ranger EV, and Honda EV Plus, were crushed, as documented in Who Killed the Electric Car? The few survivors were crippled and sent to museums, except one fully functioning EV1 at the Smithsonian. There are some rumors of others, but unconfirmed. Many RAV4 EVs, Ford Ranger EVs, and Chevy S10 EVs survived, thanks to leasing differences—and in the case of the RAV4 EV, brief sales, which is how both Kate Walton-Elliott and I drove RAV4 EVs for a while. This week, an EV enthusiast named Billy purchased an EV1 at auction for one hundred and eighteen thousand dollars, becoming the first person to legally own one. Originally leased in Colorado via Arizona, it was decommissioned, donated to a Georgia university, then abandoned in a towing lot. Billy plans to restore VIN 212 in time for the EV1’s thirtieth birthday—and perhaps give its former owner a drive.

And on that exciting note – we are done with today’s show.

And in closing, some important words:

You are valid. You are loved. You belong. You have a purpose.

While politicians around the world continue to slide toward authoritarianism, remember: the way we stop it is through intentional action. Engage in Tactical Frivolity. Don’t surrender to fear, hate, or misinformation. That’s as true in Portland, Oregon, as it is anywhere power and greed seek to crush the will of ordinary people.

Don’t buy into division and cruelty. Empathy is a skill we must practice daily to preserve our shared humanity. Just like humor, it’s an act of radical resistance.

But everyone needs time out. Unplug, get outside, dive into a good book — I shared my current favorite on today’s show — and recharge. Care for yourself and your loved ones now, so you can return ready to fight for decency, community, justice, and a better world. Let your light shine — in or outside an inflatable frog costume.

Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. Don’t let hate or ignorance win. As always, keep evolving!",https://www.transportevolved.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ten_556_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 11:20:29.326860

From 2019 to 2025, at least 25 bills were introduced to advance energy affordability, transparency, and access to clean energy in Kentucky.
Sierra Club Kentucky’s report urges lawmakers to reverse course by reinstating fair net metering, requiring utilities to disclose disconnection data, and holding energy-intensive industries accountable for their impact on rates and reliability.
“This is about more than politics,” said Sarah Reeves, Grassroots Coordinator of the Sierra Club Kentucky Chapter.
“Kentucky’s energy future should serve the people who keep the lights on—not the corporations profiting from outdated policies.” The full report, Profits Over People: How Kentucky’s Legislature Has Undermined Energy Affordability, is available at http://sierraclub.org/kentucky/profits-over-people-report.","FRANKFORT, KY — A new report released today by the Sierra Club, titled Profits Over People: How Kentucky’s Legislature Has Undermined Energy Affordability, reveals how Kentucky lawmakers have systematically advanced the interests of utilities, fossil fuel companies, and cryptocurrency miners—while blocking efforts to make energy more affordable for Kentucky families.

The report examines nearly a decade of legislative activity and finds a consistent pattern: legislation that benefits industry moves quickly through the General Assembly, while those that would lower costs for households or expand access to clean energy rarely receive a hearing.

“For too long, Kentucky’s energy policy has been written by and for the utilities,” said Julia Finch, Director of the Sierra Club Kentucky Chapter. “Lawmakers talk about affordability, but the record shows they’ve repeatedly sided with corporate profits over the needs of working families.”

Among the report’s findings:

Coal and fossil fuel mandates such as 2023’s SB 4 and 2024’s SB 349 have imposed stricter regulatory requirements that make it harder to retire uneconomic coal plants. These bills prioritize preserving coal infrastructure over more cost-effective energy alternatives, increasing costs that ultimately fall on consumers.

Crypto and data center incentives, including 2021’s HB 230 and HB 775, have created tax exemptions and regulatory protections that encourage energy-intensive industries. These operations strain the grid, drive up electricity costs, and shift financial and environmental burdens onto residents and communities.

From 2019 to 2025, at least 25 bills were introduced to advance energy affordability, transparency, and access to clean energy in Kentucky. Most were never heard in committee, and not a single one passed.

The report also identifies a core group of legislators who have repeatedly sponsored or championed bills that raise costs for Kentuckians while protecting utility interests.

Sierra Club Kentucky’s report urges lawmakers to reverse course by reinstating fair net metering, requiring utilities to disclose disconnection data, and holding energy-intensive industries accountable for their impact on rates and reliability.

“This is about more than politics,” said Sarah Reeves, Grassroots Coordinator of the Sierra Club Kentucky Chapter. “Kentucky’s energy future should serve the people who keep the lights on—not the corporations profiting from outdated policies.”

In its formal comments submitted to the EPA, the organization warned that failure to act could cost U.S. soybean farmers between $3.2 billion and $7.5 billion in crop value over the next two years, citing estimates from the World Agricultural and Economic Environmental Services (WAEES) model, reports Iowabiodiesel.org.

Grant Kimberley, Executive Director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, said that biomass-based diesel contributes about 10 percent of the value of each bushel of soybeans grown in the U.S., adding that this support is critical as farmers face record yields amid uncertain global markets.

The IBB’s comments also highlighted the vulnerability of Iowa’s independent biodiesel producers, who lack the financial strength of larger companies to cope with extended periods of policy uncertainty. Kimberley warned that losing these producers would be a major setback for the renewable fuels industry, eliminating years of investment and removing key local markets for Iowa’s farmers at a time when they can least afford it.

The organization urged the EPA to reallocate all small refinery exemptions for 2023 through 2027, finalize Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) before the next compliance year begins, and maintain strong volume targets to ensure stability for farmers and producers.

IBB expressed appreciation for the EPA’s recognition of the expanding production capacity and feedstock investments driving growth in U.S.-made biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel. However, the group stressed that delays in finalizing the rule leave the biomass-based diesel sector uncertain and unable to plan future investments. Kimberley noted that Iowa farmers are already preparing for the next planting season and need clarity to make informed decisions.

According to a national study commissioned by Clean Fuels Alliance America, Iowa’s biodiesel industry supports 12,000 jobs and generates $3.5 billion in economic activity each year. In 2024, the state’s 10 operating biodiesel plants produced about 350 million gallons, making Iowa the leading biodiesel-producing state in the country.

Jeff Hurd asks U.S. Energy Department to order that coal plant stay open,Judith Kohler,,,,,https://www.denverpost.com/2025/11/01/jeff-hurd-coal-plant-pueblo-comanche/,"Comanche will be Xcel’s last coal plant in Colorado when it closes.
Xcel Energy has proposed replacing the coal plant with wind and solar power, battery storage and natural gas generation.
The advisory group Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, formed in cooperation with Xcel, recommended that the coal plant be replaced by natural gas or small, modular nuclear reactors.
Trump has championed coal and nuclear power as energy sources while attacking renewable energy.
Hurd said in his letter to Wright, a fellow Coloradan, that the Comanche power plant is “a cornerstone of electric reliability in the region” and a lifeline for Pueblo County.","Colorado Congressman Jeff Hurd has asked Energy Secretary Chris Wright to issue an emergency order that the two units at the Comanche power plant keep operating because there’s a risk of an energy shortfall if the coal facility in Pueblo County is shut down when planned.

The Republican who represents Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, which includes Pueblo County, said in a letter Thursday to Wright that “the state’s politically driven rush to decommission otherwise safe, reliable, and efficient generation” could leave Colorado short of reliable sources of electricity.

Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, closed a unit of the coal facility in 2022 and plans to close another by the end of this year. The third and last unit at the site is scheduled to shut down by the end of 2030.

Comanche 3 is Xcel’s largest generating unit in Colorado, but one plagued by chronic malfunctions and breakdowns. And it’s one that hasn’t run since mid-August and might not be operational again until next summer.

Comanche will be Xcel’s last coal plant in Colorado when it closes. The company decided to shut the plant earlier than planned as questions about its reliability grew and moves to cut the state’s greenhouse gas emissions intensified.

Xcel Energy has proposed replacing the coal plant with wind and solar power, battery storage and natural gas generation.

But some Pueblo County business and political leaders say Xcel’s plan, which was endorsed by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, won’t replace the jobs and tax revenue the Comanche plant has provided to the community for years. The advisory group Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, formed in cooperation with Xcel, recommended that the coal plant be replaced by natural gas or small, modular nuclear reactors.

In September, the Pueblo County commissioners filed a document with regulators saying they would ask President Donald Trump and Wright to order that the coal plants in the county keep running until a new energy facility is built that can provide the kind of jobs and revenue that Xcel’s coal facilities have.

The plant generates approximately $200 million per year in economic activity and $31 million annually in property tax revenue, according to a report by the Pueblo advisory committee.

Trump has championed coal and nuclear power as energy sources while attacking renewable energy. The administration issued emergency directives to keep coal plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania operating despite plans to retire them.

Hurd said in his letter to Wright, a fellow Coloradan, that the Comanche power plant is “a cornerstone of electric reliability in the region” and a lifeline for Pueblo County. A message was left with Hurd asking if he has concerns about Comanche 3’s operational troubles.

A message was also left with the Department of Energy asking whether Wright is considering issuing an order to keep the coal plant running until a new source of power generation begins operating.

“We are in regular conversations about Colorado’s energy future with various stakeholders, including federal, state and local elected officials. We are aware that there are members of the community that would like to see the plant’s life extended,” Xcel Energy spokeswoman Michelle Aguayo said in an email Friday.

Aguayo added that Colorado regulations call for the closing of Comanche 2 at the end of 2025. She said the unit has been a reliable part of Xcel’s generation fleet since1975.

“We are also aware that federal actions can extend plants of this nature,” Aguayo said. “We will comply with any orders issued by the Department of Energy to extend our coal plants if ordered to do so.”

Emma Pinter, chair of the Adams County commissioners, called Hurd’s letter to Wright “beyond disappointing.”

“Keeping this unreliable and polluting coal plant open is going to cost Coloradans tens – maybe hundreds – of millions of dollars, and it’s not even necessary. There’s no energy emergency in Colorado,” Pinter said in an email.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TDP-L-Comanche-coal-RJS-10418.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2025-11-01 13:05:33.617191

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,” coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to “keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. The rest was thermal coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, according to Blumenfeld.

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.

Appalachia would therefore benefit most from a resumption of U.S. coal exports to China, noted Blumenfeld by email.

“There is optimism,” Blumenfeld wrote. “But there is little documentation to back that up right now.”

Most coal headed for China last year went through Baltimore, with lesser amounts via the Norfolk, Virginia, area and Gulf of Mexico, according to Blumenfeld.

Relatively little thermal coal from the Western U.S. is exported due to the cost of hauling it by rail to the West Coast, where there has also been political resistance to building port facilities to export more coal.",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/10/69053e247802e3.76442270.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-01 14:19:16.700453

The soy protein electrolyte also showed a significantly lower release of toxic or flammable volatile compounds compared to other materials.","Researchers at Tsinghua University, Beijing, have developed a renewable material made from soy protein that could power the next generation of solid-state batteries with high efficiency and long lifespans.

Solid-state batteries have been hailed as the successor to lithium-ion battery technologies used everywhere today from smartphones to electric vehicles. The core innovation in solid-state batteries lies in the electrolyte, an essential component of any battery that acts as a bridge between the electrodes, allowing metal ions to travel through it to generate electricity. As their name implies, solid-state batteries replace conventional liquid electrolytes with solid materials, enabling faster charging and potentially doubling energy storage capacity.

Development is still underway to make solid-state batteries competitive with other batteries in both performance and cost. A solution that is increasingly gaining attention consists of using renewable materials to make solid electrolytes, offering a way to reduce the environmental impact of battery manufacturing while improving battery performance and safety.

“Our research advances the use of green and sustainable biomass materials in the field of battery science and technology, contributing to creating a cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable future,” says Yang Shen, a professor at Tsinghua University and an author of the study. “Compared to traditional solid electrolytes, the high-performance solid electrolytes developed using renewable [soy protein] help reduce waste generation and minimize environmental impact.”

From soybeans to high-end batteries

Soy protein is a renewable, low-cost material that can be grown in abundance, making it an ideal candidate to make affordable, environmentally friendly batteries. The natural structure of the soy proteins allows ions to travel through them, while simultaneously enabling scientists to easily modify the material and tailor its properties to suit a wide range of applications.

“Primarily used in the food and medical industries, its accessibility, non-toxicity, and biodegradability make [soy protein] a promising material for potential applications in other fields,” says Shen.

To make a material suitable for batteries, his research team chemically modified soy proteins to increase their natural conductivity, helping lithium ions travel through more easily. The resulting material consists of a three-dimensional network of hard and soft layers that make the electrolyte tough and flexible at the same time.

A solid-state lithium battery built using this soy-based electrolyte was able to stably charge and discharge for 2,000 hours at 60°C. When the temperature was raised to 120°C, the battery retained nearly 75% of its capacity for over 800 charging cycles, showing potential for applications that require reliable performance at high temperatures. In contrast, conventional lithium-ion batteries are typically unstable at temperatures over 60°C, which severely impacts their performance and can pose safety risks such as the leakage of toxic and highly flammable compounds.

Additionally, the soy-based material could address a major challenge for many electrolytes currently in development: As a battery charges and discharges, a chemical reaction can occur between the electrolyte and the electrodes that deposits chemicals to create an interface layer. If this layer is not stabilized, it will keep growing with every charging cycle, slowly reducing the battery’s performance over time.

Batteries built with the soy-based material created a thin and uniform interface between the electrolyte and electrodes that remained stable over time. Moreover, the interface layer was flexible, allowing it to expand and contract with the battery as it cycles, preventing cracks.

A lifecycle assessment showed that the manufacturing of the soy-based material would have a lower environmental impact with regard to acidification, release of carcinogens, and fossil fuel use compared to other organic electrolyte materials that have shown promise in solid-state battery applications. The soy protein electrolyte also showed a significantly lower release of toxic or flammable volatile compounds compared to other materials.

“These results demonstrated that [soy-based] materials hold great potential in the field of energy storage and provide a promising route toward biomass-based solid electrolytes,” says Shen.

While more work will be needed to refine this material and make it suitable for large-scale production of next-generation batteries, soy protein could one day become the foundation for eco-friendly batteries with long lifespans. In particular, Shen and colleagues see promise for applications in electric vehicles and electronic devices, especially for any use cases where batteries may need to reliably work under extreme temperatures.

The agreements, detailed in a recent report by TechCrunch, involve partnerships with renewable energy providers in the U.S., highlighting Meta’s strategy to offset its carbon footprint while supporting ambitious artificial intelligence initiatives.

These deals bring Meta’s 2025 solar purchases to over 3 gigawatts, according to industry analyses, positioning the company as a heavyweight in corporate renewable procurement. As data centers proliferate to handle AI workloads, energy demands have skyrocketed, prompting tech giants like Meta to lock in clean power sources to mitigate regulatory pressures and operational costs.

Powering the AI Boom

One key agreement expands Meta’s collaboration with Engie North America, incorporating a massive 600-megawatt solar project in Texas valued at around $900 million, as reported by Electrek. This project alone will supply 100% of its output to Meta’s U.S. data centers, reflecting a broader trend where tech firms are directly funding renewable infrastructure to ensure reliable, green energy.

Additional pacts include deals with other providers for solar capacity in various states, collectively pushing the total to nearly 1 gigawatt this week. Such procurements not only address immediate power needs but also signal long-term commitments to net-zero goals, with Meta aiming to power all operations with renewables by 2030.

Strategic Implications for Tech and Energy Sectors

Industry insiders note that Meta’s aggressive buying spree—following earlier purchases exceeding 1 gigawatt in June, per another TechCrunch piece—stems from CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision for AI dominance. The company’s data center investments are projected to require immense electricity, rivaling that of small nations, making solar a cost-effective hedge against volatile fossil fuel prices.

Moreover, these moves are reshaping the energy market. By inking power purchase agreements (PPAs), Meta is catalyzing solar farm development, particularly in sun-rich regions like Texas, where Engie’s project will create jobs and boost local economies. Reuters highlighted in a recent article how such expansions with Engie elevate their joint capacity to over 1.3 gigawatts, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between Big Tech and utilities.

Challenges and Broader Context

Yet, challenges loom. Solar intermittency requires backup solutions, and grid integration remains a hurdle in some areas. Critics argue that while these deals offset emissions, they don’t fully address the environmental toll of data center construction, including water usage and land impacts.

Comparatively, peers like Google and Amazon have pursued similar strategies, but Meta’s pace this year stands out, with total renewables now surpassing 10 gigawatts globally. As Yahoo Finance observed, these investments are as much about public image as practicality, helping Meta navigate scrutiny over its energy-intensive metaverse and AI pursuits.

Future Outlook and Industry Ripple Effects

Looking ahead, experts predict more such mega-deals as AI adoption accelerates. Meta’s actions could pressure competitors to follow suit, potentially accelerating the U.S. transition to renewables. With solar costs plummeting, these procurements might yield financial returns through tax credits and stable pricing.

Ultimately, Meta’s 1-gigawatt solar haul this week exemplifies how tech innovation is intertwined with energy sustainability, setting a precedent for corporate responsibility in an era of exponential digital growth. As the sector evolves, such initiatives will likely define the balance between technological advancement and environmental stewardship.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-b225740a-d370-4211-a908-87e914cdd5c6.jpeg,N,,2025-11-01 13:59:31.551522

United States Senator Mike Lee of Utah introduced legislation titled:

The Fair Air Enforcement Act.

Senator Lee describes the legislation as stopping:

…weaponization of the judicial system by outlawing citizen suits under the Clean Air Act, which has been used by political groups to hurt Americans and their businesses.

Almost every federal environmental statute includes a “citizen suit” provision which allows a citizen to enforce environmental laws directly by bringing federal judicial actions against facilities that are allegedly violating the federal environmental statutes or regulations. The various citizen suit provisions in the federal environmental statutes generally allow individuals or groups to file an action in federal court against any person or any governmental instrumentality or agency currently violating a federal environmental statute’s requirements.

The argument in favor of federal environmental citizen suits is that enforcement agencies lack the resources to address all facilities violating federal environmental laws or regulations. Such provisions allow plaintiffs to ask a federal court to impose civil penalties for a source’s violations. Further, they can request injunctive relief (i.e., request an order from the court requiring a facility to take specific actions to correct compliance problems and avoid future violations).

Note that a citizen or non-profit organization seeking to file such federal action must first serve the alleged violator, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and any relevant state agency with certain notices that identify the alleges violations. This provides a grace period in which the alleged violator can come into compliance, or the EPA or state agency can file its own action which may then preclude citizen enforcement.

The Fair Enforcement Act would:

Amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit lawsuits by private citizens alleging violations of its provisions.

Require such enforcement lawsuits to be brought by state governments and relevant agencies.

Make conforming changes to other sections of U.S. code referencing the amended provision.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 12:06:53.613680

I am excited to see FAST-41 provide a transparent and predictable permitting process for this critical project.”

The project, sponsored by Revenant Energy Operating LLC, proposes up to four well pads with as many as 32 wells in total, along with gathering lines, access roads, and a trunk pipeline to move natural gas produced from both private and Bureau of Land Management (BLM)-managed minerals in Angelina National Forest.

“The need for responsibly sourced energy to support the country’s rapidly expanding infrastructure project growth is overwhelming, and we believe the FAST-41 permitting process provides the most efficient method for transparent and environmentally responsible regulatory review,” said Chelsea Budowsky, Senior Vice President of Land at Revenant Energy.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service will serve as the lead federal agency for the project’s permitting process. Details are available on the Federal Permitting Dashboard.

I’m familiar with his priorities and what he’s working on, but I’m one of 16 members on the California Air Resources Board.
The state had over 100 lawsuits against the first Trump administration, over 70 related to climate and the environment.
We saw, out of the gate, the federal administration deploy a variety of new tactics.
So, I don’t know that I credit the Trump administration for more sophistication so much as it’s just a very different chessboard.","With help from Noah Baustin, Marc Heller, Ben Lefebvre and Jason Plautz

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: After four years operating largely behind the scenes as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s top climate adviser, Lauren Sanchez is now out front in the state’s fight to defend its ambitious goals from an unrelenting Trump administration.

Sanchez was sworn in earlier this month as chair of the California Air Resources Board. She steps into the role at a crucial moment for the agency, as it tries to preserve its authority to regulate vehicle emissions standards and works to keep its climate ambitions intact as the federal government retreats from international goals — all while developing regulations for critical programs like cap-and-trade.

Sanchez, who was a key negotiator for Newsom as the governor and state lawmakers hammered out a last-minute energy and gasoline affordability package at the end of the legislative session earlier this year, must now try to strike a delicate balance between efforts to reduce emissions without pushing California’s already high cost-of-living higher.

Sanchez spoke to POLITICO about her time advising Newsom on climate policy, the state’s role in countering the Trump administration and her top policy targets as CARB chair.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Do you talk with the governor about the politics of climate as an issue? And how do you calibrate how far to go and where not to go?

His north star on this issue continues to be our international leadership. He is in the business of ensuring that California is relevant in the future economy. If you look into the future 5-10 years, we’re going to have a number of electro states, not petro states. It’s said that China is already the first electro state. I think that the governor has seen things we have been able to do here in California, crises we have been able to respond to.

I’ll give you two examples. Coming into office with the Paradise fire and then doubling down on investments, on forest management, fire protection, and using AI for early fire protection. And then I turned to battery deployment. He came into office [with the state] at 770 megawatts [of battery storage]. The CARB scoping plan from 2017 did not envision a role for battery storage. We had the rolling blackouts of 2020, and the state’s response to that is an enormous deployment of batteries, such that now we haven’t even had a flex alert in the last three years. We’re almost at, we’re at 16 gigawatts of battery storage. And I’ll tell you, when we travel the world, one of the questions the governor gets from developed economies that are hitting higher levels of renewable penetration is, “How do you deal with intermittency?” And we’re able to point to the track record on battery storage.

As you reflect on this new role, how does it differ from working as an adviser to Newsom? Do you have a different constituency or different goals?

I am held accountable by my appointing authority, the governor, and still remain close to him. I’m familiar with his priorities and what he’s working on, but I’m one of 16 members on the California Air Resources Board. In my first few weeks here as chair, I have spent time getting to know each of them. A number of them are Governor appointees. Some are appointed by the legislature, and a big part of this job now is making sure that the board continues to guide this agency and staff in the direction of laying the track record for climate action and economic growth going hand in hand.

I’ll also say, distinctly different from my climate advisory role, is all of the work the board is doing on clean air and air quality. One of my first constituency meetings was visiting the San Joaquin Valley Air District, and their board and stakeholders are really focused on cleaning the air in the valley. I think a number of stakeholder relationships that I bring from my former job will continue to be really relevant to CARB’s work, and continuing to work with the governor, the Legislature, who have given us a handful of legislative mandates that now we are again rolling up our sleeves to make sure we implement.

Aside from cap-and-trade, are there any other big-ticket items that you’re anticipating bringing to the board next year?

We have two additional important pieces of legislation to bring to the board next year. SB 905, regarding carbon removal and our regulatory framework for that, which is a big part of how we’re going to reach carbon neutrality. Sen. [Anna] Caballero’s bill from our first climate package. And SB 253 and 261, around corporate disclosure. A lot of stakeholder interest in both of those. Those will be big items to bring to the board. Just next month, we are bringing the landfill methane regulation to the board. Methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide; our best chance at staving off near-term warming is addressing methane.

You’ve previously said you were surprised by the effectiveness of the Trump administration at hampering California’s policy goals. Why did that come as a surprise to you and California leaders when a lot of it was laid out in Project 2025?

We are familiar with the playbook they used in Trump 1.0. The state had over 100 lawsuits against the first Trump administration, over 70 related to climate and the environment. We were largely successful.

We saw, out of the gate, the federal administration deploy a variety of new tactics. You’ve seen the governor comment on the role of Congress and how that is significantly different in this administration. You’ve heard the governor comment on the role of corporations, law firms, universities. The environment is very different. So, I don’t know that I credit the Trump administration for more sophistication so much as it’s just a very different chessboard.

The governor has specifically called out General Motors CEO Mary Barra for her role in rolling back California’s electric vehicle sales rules. What happened to anger him so much, and how close were you to landing deals with other companies?

General Motors, full stop, negotiated in bad faith and played both sides and continued to work with Congress. And I think ’s important about where we are now, and me coming into this role as chair, is that we’re moving forward. You saw the workshop that we hosted last week about what does the next era of regulations on clean cars look like in California. It is very much our intention to continue moving the next wave of regulations forward. We have gotten over 100 waivers from EPA, Democratic administrations, Republican administrations, and we plan to continue our long track record of technologically feasible, cost-effective standards that have borne the catalytic converter and the electric vehicle revolution you see transforming the world today.

Four truck makers signed an agreement with the Trump administration saying they’ll never work with California on another voluntary agreement. EPA is pushing back on CARB’s attempt to bring back its 2012 light-duty vehicle emissions rules. Are all bets off at this point?

The federal government and U.S. EPA have abdicated their duty to protect Americans, in particular Californians. Millions of Californians suffer from breathing dirty air. More than 10 million Californians breathe unhealthy air, according to the U.S. EPA, 1,500 Californians die prematurely from air pollution every year in Southern California alone. We have a federal administration that is denying climate science, that is letting polluters off the hook with an email exemption that is undermining their own ability to take on these regulations, and they will stop at nothing in attacking Californians. My response to them, and you’ve heard this from the Governor, is California will not back down. You saw the lawsuit on Monday. We look forward to defending that lawsuit, and frankly, every other lawsuit that has been filed against us or we have filed in court. We are confident we will prevail because of the underlying authority granted to California, full stop.

FORESTRY FRACAS: A fast-moving federal bill to improve forest management and reduce wildfire risks in national forests has split not only environmentalists, but California’s two senators as well.

The “Fix Our Forests Act,” S. 1462, would give the U.S. Agriculture secretary wide latitude to declare “emergency” situations on millions of acres of federal land, providing a work-around on environmental safeguards, reports Marc Heller for POLITICO’s E&E news.

The legislation spells out a couple of scenarios for fast-tracked thinning of forests and logging, which the bill’s boosters say will help prevent the worst wildfires by depriving them of potential fuel. But Ellen Stuart-Haëntjens, executive director of the Virginia Wilderness Committee, said that the “emergency” designation is so broad that it could encompass projects that have more to do with harvesting timber than preventing wildfires.

“This administration is redefining what we call an emergency,” Haentjens said.

California Sen. Alex Padilla is one of the bill’s main Democratic sponsors in the Senate. He believes that the legislation would protect some of the National Environmental Policy Act regulations that the Trump administration is looking to change, aides to the senator said. That includes ensuring public involvement as projects are proposed, they said.

Sen. Adam Schiff, meanwhile, has opposed the measure.

Their division mirrors one among environmental advocates: the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Wildlife Federation are in favor, while the Center for Biological Diversity and Earthjustice are firmly opposed.

The bill advanced out of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee with bipartisan support earlier this month. The House passed a similar bill earlier this year. — MH, NB

CEQA DEFENSE: After a legislative session in which lawmakers chipped away at environmental rules for construction projects, the Assembly’s Natural Resources chair wants lawmakers to strike a better balance.

Asked about the biggest hurdles lawmakers face going into next year, Assemblymember Isaac Bryan told attendees to a webinar Thursday that the California Environmental Quality Act — the law often blamed for slowing down housing and energy projects — is “still under attack.”

“CEQA, at times, has been abused and misused,” Bryan said. “But that doesn’t mean the idea of looking through a healthy and thoughtful, long-term criteria for what this kind of building would do to our environment isn’t important.”

Bryan’s appearance on the webinar hosted by the Climate Center came a little over a week after the California Chamber of Commerce filed a ballot initiative to further streamline CEQA and limit lawsuits against affordable housing, clean energy and other projects deemed “essential.” — AN

NOT YOU, CALIFORNIA: Widespread opposition to new offshore drilling has pressured the Trump administration to back off plans to open the waters off the coasts of many states. California isn’t one of them.

The Interior Department has removed the federal waters off the Atlantic coast from its offshore drilling plan in the face of Republican pressure, but still plans to propose allowing new oil and gas leases off the California coast, reports POLITICO’s Ben Lefebvre. The plan’s latest iteration will also include a portion of the eastern Gulf of Mexico but provide a buffer around Florida, a Republican stronghold long opposed to drilling, three people familiar with the latest moves told POLITICO.

The Interior Department is expected to propose the new plan soon, the people said. It could change before its final publication, and will go through a review process before becoming public.

A White House spokesperson declined to discuss ongoing policy deliberations, and an Interior spokesperson did not respond to questions.

California political leaders have come out in sharp opposition to the possibility of new oil and gas leases opening off their shore. — BL, NB

BUILD IT FIRST: Forget concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble: West Coast tech titans are all in on data center growth, and the electricity grid upgrades needed to fuel it, reports Jason Plautz for POLITICO’s E&E News.

If the nation’s internet giants overestimate the coming demand for data centers, Americans could end up footing the outsized electricity bills for new energy infrastructure built to meetr demand that never materialized.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg didn’t appear to be concerned during the company’s Wednesday earnings call. He thinks the right strategy is to “aggressively front-load building capacity” — though he acknowledged that it’s “of course possible to overshoot.”

Worst case, he said, is “we effectively have just prebuilt for a couple of years ... but we’d grow into that and use it over time.”

Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said during her company’s earnings call Wednesday that she has “very high” confidence that all the data centers will be needed. Executives from Amazon and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, expressed similar confidence in moving forward with data center construction.

Those decisions are having ripple effects across the country. American Electric Power— a utility spanning parts of 11 states — increased its five-year capital spending plan by nearly 30 percent in order to meet data center needs. — JP, NB

The kingdom is aware that fossil fuels, the source of its fabulous wealth, are on their way out. Its leaders want to have a modern electro-state in place when the pumps fall idle.

The UNDP officials say that Saudi Arabia has connected over 10 gigawatts of renewable energy to its grid and has another 33 gigawatts in the pipeline. Saudi officials want to install 20 gigawatts of green energy every year, so as to reach their goal of 50% of the grid in only 5 years. They write, “Saudi Arabia is deploying solar energy at a faster rate than any country in history.”

It is an astonishing statistic, though it should be put into context. China is the country that has put in the most solar, and in quantities that dwarf that of the Saudis. It is just that they have been working at it for a while. Saudi Arabia, having spent six years preparing the stage, is now taking off like a rocket.

Saudi Arabia also already has 2 gigawatts of battery storage in place, ensuring that it can store wind and solar energy for when the wind dies down or for night time use. It has another 5.5 gigawatts of battery storage in the pipeline, and wants to double that by 2030.

Although it may seem paradoxical for an oil state like Saudi Arabia to go big into wind and solar, it makes perfect economic sense, as I have argued elsewhere. About 38% of Saudi power plants use petroleum and 62% of electricity generation is done by domestically produced fossil gas. Wind and solar are cheaper ways of making electricity domestically. As long as some countries in the outside world will buy Saudi oil and gas, it makes much more economic sense to export those commodities for a profit than to use them up at home, with a government subsidy. In a recent year, Saudi Arabia lost $11 billion on energy generation, and demand is increasing 10% a year. The kingdom needs renewables for its economic health.

The Saudis are having China’s Goldwind (“the Huawei of green energy”) build for it the largest wind farm in the world near Riyadh, with a nameplate capacity of 3 gigawatts when it is finished early in 2028, only a little over 2 years from now. This project is an example of China’s mature and sophisticated clean energy technology being deployed to help an oil giant move away from fossil fuels.

There was a time when a massive power plant in the global south would have been built by American firms, but the backward Republican Party with its bondage to Big Oil is killing the American green energy industries. So it is Chinese firms that are picking up these contracts. One partner in the consortium along with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) is the Arabian American Oil Company, ARAMCO, which developed Saudi oil in the late forties and fifties. Originally American-dominated, it was nationalized by the Saudis in the 1970s. Despite its name, therefore, it no longer has anything to do with America. ARAMCO is a partner in the Goldwind project! Even it has taken up with China.

Goldwind is designing its wind turbines to function in the extreme heat of Saudi summers, when temperatures can exceed 122º F.

Another big wind farm, with a 1.5 gigawatt capacity, is planned at Dawadmi near Riyadh by a consortium led by South Korea’s KEPCO. It has achieved a new world record for the lowest cost of producing electricity from wind energy.

The 1.4 gigawatt Najran Solar Project is being built in partnership with Masdar, the UAE-based clean energy firm. It can generate electricity for about a U.S. penny a kilowatt hour, the second lowest price for this sort of power in the world. The only plant that is cheaper is also in Saudi Arabia. Najran, in the southwest of the kingdom down near Yemen, gets a lot of sunshine. But a penny a kilowatt hour? Fossil fuels may as well just pack up and go away. At their best, they are six to ten times that.

The kingdom has 7 big renewable energy projects in the pipeline at the moment, at a cost of over $8 billion, with a goal of producing 15 gigawatts of power.

“Solar Kingdom,” Digital, Dall-E / Clip2Comic, 2025

The giant Saudi green energy company, ACWA, announced this month that renewables in the kingdom no longer need government subsidies. The technology, mostly Chinese, has fallen in price so dramatically, and the kingdom is so well endowed with sunshine and steady winds, that sustainable energy is a money-maker in its own right.

ACWA Power’s Mohammed Abu Nyan told Sharq Business reporter Maya Hajij, “if it were not for technology, in which Chinese innovations play a key role, we would not have witnessed what has been achieved so far in the energy transformation side.”

He is convinced that large language models (“artificial intelligence”) will enable a doubling of green energy production. Abu Nyan does not seem to have said how, exactly, in this interview. But perhaps AI can help in solar panel and wind turbine design and placement for maximum efficiency. Data centers are energy hogs, but it would be an interesting development if they really could pay for themselves twice over by redesigning greentech so as to achieve efficiency breakthroughs.",https://media.juancole.com/images/2025/11/IMG_7190b.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 14:58:46.997161

Key topics discussed

Shale Revolution: The U.S. led the shale revolution, but significant shale reserves also exist in Argentina, China, and other countries. Argentina’s Vaca Muerta is seeing major growth, while China faces water constraints.

Break-even Prices: The Permian Basin break-even oil price is closer to $50-60 per barrel. $60 oil is about the minimum needed to incentivize new drilling.

Energy Stocks vs. Oil Prices: Energy stocks (as shown by the XLE energy sector ETF) have outperformed the underlying oil commodity recently, partly because refiners perform well when oil prices are lower.

AI & Electricity Demand: The AI revolution and cloud computing are driving surging electricity demand, benefiting utilities (especially those selling into competitive markets, like NRG Energy).

Small Modular Reactors: Small nuclear reactors are gaining traction as a solution for high power demand, but regulatory hurdles and the risk of safety shortcuts remain concerns.

OPEC & Oil Markets: OPEC is overproducing, keeping oil prices around $60 and trying to squeeze out U.S. shale producers, similar to past strategies.

California’s Energy Policy: California has unique regulations that make gasoline more expensive and is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign oil as it restricts local production and refineries.

Midstream Investments: Midstream energy companies (pipelines, storage, MLPs) offer stable, high-yield income for investors and are less volatile than upstream/downstream sectors, making them attractive for retirement portfolios.

Transcript

Jim Puplava:

Well, we've seen the price of oil stabilize. It's in the $60 range. Some think it could go higher. Energy stocks have done better than the commodity. Well, let's find out what's going on in the Energy Patch. Joining me on the program is Robert Rapier. Robert, I want to talk about an article you recently wrote for Forbes. It was called ""America's Newest Export: the Shale Revolution."" In it, you reference that perhaps shale may be plateauing here in the U.S., but there are some big shale plays out there. One is in Argentina you talked about, and another one in China. So let's talk about that.

Robert Rapier:

The shale revolution in the U.S.—I mean, it was born in the U.S.—but all along, you know, the Energy Information Administration was putting out these maps showing there are enormous shale oil and gas reserves in several countries around the world. And sometimes there are constraints. You know, some countries aren't really interested in pursuing that. In some countries, the environmental movement has made it very difficult to do. Some countries lack water. But one where it seemed like it would probably get some traction was Argentina. The Vaca Muerta formation has a lot of technically recoverable resources: 16 billion barrels of oil and 308 trillion cubic feet of gas. Oil majors are investing there, and the area's oil output rose by 27% last year. Gas went up 23%. Chevron, Shell—they're all investing. And Chevron has come out and publicly stated that this is one of the most significant unconventional oil reserves and has said they're going to be up to about 30,000 barrels per day by the end of this year. I expect that area to continue to develop beyond that. China has technically the largest recoverable shale gas reserves, but they're in areas where there's not a lot of water, so that makes it a little more challenging. But, you know, if they can figure that out, there are tremendous implications. If China ever really unleashes the shale gas they have, that could really reshape the whole LNG flows of the entire region and reduce China's coal dependence. And then, Saudi Arabia actually has a lot of shale gas and would like to develop that and save their oil for export. There are a whole lot of other countries with enormous potential. Russia's one, but they've just got so much low-cost conventional reserves, they've had little motivation to invest in their shale technologies. But, you know, there are a lot of other countries. Canada has produced some shale gas and oil. Australia has a lot of promise, but there are a lot of environmental regulatory concerns there. And then, you know, there are a number of other countries that are either looking at it or testing it. But if you look at the maps of the resource, you know, it's pretty scattered around the world. I mean, North and South America, across Africa, a lot in Russia, a lot in China.

Jim Puplava:

Well, it's amazing when you look at the price of oil. It hit a bottom in April and it's been hovering back and forth between, you know, mid-60s, lower-60s. And Robert, what's the break-even point in the Permian right now? Is it 60 bucks or is it 50 bucks?

Robert Rapier:

Do you know what it is for brand new? Well, it's probably a little lower than 60. It's probably closer to 50.

Jim Puplava:

Right.

Robert Rapier:

But right now it's not. $60 won't incentivize a lot of drilling. I think that's about the bare minimum for, you know, oil producers. They don't really want to see it lower than that. I think they'd prefer to see it around $70. And I think you'd see drilling activity pick up if there were a sustained period where it's back up in the seventy- to eighty-dollar range. You know, we've seen the rig count falling and the main reason for that is just, you know, the outlook for oil prices. Oil prices have been low, and the outlook is that they will remain, you know, in this range for the foreseeable future.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, because I know the President wants to see ""drill, baby, drill,"" but if you're an oil company and the price is at 60, why would you want to overproduce and drive the price even lower?

Robert Rapier:

Yeah, that's the problem. I mean, I think President Trump is trying to make consumers happy with low oil and gas prices. But that doesn't make the oil companies happy and that certainly doesn't make them want to go out and drill. They don't drill because the President says ""drill, baby, drill."" They drill because they look at their economics and they say, okay, we can make money here. We think oil prices are going to be here. But, you know, if oil prices were at $40, President Trump could scream ""drill, baby, drill"" every day, and they're not going to drill. At the end of the day, they're beholden to shareholders, and that's—they've got to make decisions based on, you know, what their economics look like.

Jim Puplava:

Well, it's amazing because if you look at the price of oil, it's really gone nowhere. But then if you look at the XLE, since its bottom in April, it's up about 10%. So the stocks are doing better than the commodity.

Robert Rapier:

Yeah. And one reason for that is refiners are doing so, so well. When oil prices are falling, a lot of people don't realize, you know, the oil producers usually aren't doing as well, but the refiners—that's usually when their margins expand, when oil prices are falling. And if you look at who did really, really well in the third quarter, it was the refiners. All the refiners were up, you know, solid double digits. And you're seeing the midstream producers did okay. The tanker operators did extremely well in the third quarter. But, yeah, and also natural gas prices are high. So, you know, oil companies with a lot of gas production or gas companies are doing quite well.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, because, I mean, you look at a company like Valero, which has gone from 100 to almost 170. So not bad for a quarter.

Robert Rapier:

Exactly right.

Jim Puplava:

I want to talk about something else, and that's the AI revolution and cloud, where companies are scrambling to get energy. And we're seeing, Robert, and you follow the utility space, but some of these utilities are beginning to look like growth stocks again. And the latest move is a lot of the big guys, whether it's Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, are talking about creating their own power source, kind of doing what Elon Musk did in Virginia when he—I think he built two nat gas plants. He did that in about three or four months. And he's got his data center powered. Let's talk about that and where that might lead.

Robert Rapier:

Yeah, and to illustrate your point, you know, NRG Energy, the Houston-based utility—that is a company that we put in our portfolio on Utility Forecaster a few years ago. And in less than three years it's up about 500%. Now that's a utility, for crying out loud. But the reason it's doing so well is they are not totally regulated. They sell power into the competitive market. And for utilities like that, for utilities that have a competitive power, at least some aspect to them, they are making enormous profits because these AI data centers are going in and consuming a lot of power. You know, I've had a lot of people ask me, why is my electricity bill higher? I said, well, the biggest reason is the AI data centers are soaking up demand that wasn't foreseen a decade ago. I mean, I've said before, in the past 150 years, there have been some really enormous revolutions that have changed our lives a lot. The automobile was one, television was one, the Internet, smartphones. And I've told people AI is going to be like that. They're going to be one of those sorts of developments where you'll look back and you'll say that's when everything changed. And this wasn't really foreseen a decade ago. And so, you know, there's an analogy here. The reason I think power prices are going to be high for a while: in the early part of this century, OPEC was not out developing new fields, and demand from China wasn't foreseen to explode in the early part of this century, but it did. And then OPEC was scrambling to try to get new oil out on the market. And what happened was they were late and we saw oil prices surge up over $100 and persistently stay there until the shale boom really took pressure off of oil prices. And I think we're going to see that here. We're going to see this power demand not be able to be alleviated for a few years. You do have a lot of companies out there—I just wrote an article for Forbes—where a lot of these small modular reactors, a lot of these companies are trying to develop small nuclear. And companies like Amazon are engaging and saying, hey, we'll build some small modular reactors to try to power our data centers. Because there's just not enough out there that can be built quickly enough. And so we're going to continue to see, you know, high prices. But for investors in certain utilities, I mean, you know, a company like NRG, a utility, looks like Nvidia or something. I mean, you look at it and you go, wow, how did this happen? And I can tell you my Utility Forecaster subscribers are really, really happy about NRG. It's been our best-performing stock in the past few years. But there are a few like that—you know, Constellation and Vistra—they were some of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 last year. And it all traces back to the AI boom.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, I mean, we have utilities in our portfolio and it's just amazing how well they've done, especially some of the growth utilities that are near these data centers and providing this electricity. And a lot of these utilities, as you mentioned, like NRG, some of the ones we've invested in, are having—you know, they can sell independent power, so they've got a good portion of their business that isn't regulated. So they can make higher profits. Right. I want to talk about something else, and that's small nuclear reactors. I know China is moving ahead with this, and let's talk about the possibilities here in the U.S. and what are the difficulties they're going to have. I'm thinking of the Nuclear Regulatory Agency, which, you know, puts up all this kind of red tape.

Robert Rapier:

You know, if I had to guess, I think the Trump administration will try to clear that out as much as possible and try to, you know, clear the path for these guys. I think they can be at market a lot faster than a large plant. There are a number of players here now that are out and have developed their own technology. You know, there's NuScale, there's Terrestrial Energy. I know some of those guys, and I've known some of those guys for a long time. And so I've kind of followed what they're doing. A lot of companies now—there are risks that come along with that, though, and that is if you have a lot of players out there, there's more of a risk that somebody's going to screw up. And that's really what we have to be careful about, that everybody's doing this the right way. So when we talk about, you know, stripping away the red tape, we've got to make sure that none of these guys are taking shortcuts, because all it's going to take is one accident by somebody being careless or somebody, you know, cutting corners, and it's going to do tremendous damage. And we can go back to history and see that. If you look at the global nuclear power build-out before Chernobyl, you know, it was exponential. Nuclear power was growing by leaps and bounds. And suddenly when Chernobyl happened, there was an inflection point. And then when Fukushima happened, growth stopped. I mean, we saw nuclear power growth stop and, you know, it's just now beginning to recover. So, you know, that's the risk. The reward is with a lot of players out there developing their small modular reactors, we can probably get more to market faster. But we just have to be really careful here because a misstep could set the industry back a long time.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, I mean, contrast these small nuclear reactors to, let's say, building a mega nuclear plant that—I think, what was the last one? I think it was about 17 years and $30 billion to build. Where we get these small modular reactors, they're more built like in manufacturing, like a regular plant. So you can scale it.

Robert Rapier:

Right. And my alma mater, Texas A&M, has been doing nuclear—I mean, they've had a nuclear reactor at the university, a small one, and Terrestrial Energy is partnering with them. So, you know, that's a good partnership there. The university has tremendous experience at this and, you know, you believe they can partner together to bring this to market in a safe fashion. I think if there is an accident there, the good thing is, being small, you know, the damage is going to be limited. If there is an accident relative to a Chernobyl, where a meltdown there released tremendous amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere and you have to evacuate for miles and miles around, the smaller modular reactors are going to be safer in that way because you've got a smaller amount of material in an area. But still, I think any accident is going to bring so much scrutiny and it's going to really hurt the industry. So you really want to do this the right way.

Jim Puplava:

Well, we need to do it because if you take a look at our sources of power for utilities, we're closing down our coal-fired plants. Wind and solar don't exactly do it. So, you know, natural gas has stepped in to play, but it seems to me the next big wave has got to be nuclear.

Robert Rapier:

You're absolutely right, it has to be. And I've said this for many years, that, you know, the fastest-growing nuclear power is in China. And if you're concerned about carbon emissions going into the atmosphere, you have to cheer that development. Because if China can build out nuclear and shut down coal or, in addition, use gas-fired power to shut down coal, that is the single lowest hanging fruit as far as getting carbon emissions under control. Because that's where all the growth is coming from in carbon emissions. It's coming from Southeast Asia, it's coming from India, China, Indonesia, Vietnam. Those are the countries driving the growth globally in carbon emissions.

Jim Puplava:

So I want to talk about—go back to energy demand for a moment—because anytime you see the price of oil spike, the IEA comes out and says, you know, demand for oil has peaked. They're projecting we're running 3 million barrels a day more than what we're consuming. My question is, Robert, if that's the case, where is it showing up in inventories?

Robert Rapier:

Well, I think countries like China have built up their petroleum reserve. And I do believe it's correct—I think we're overproducing right now, and that's mainly because OPEC is overproducing right now. And, you know, OPEC tried this a decade ago. They tried to put the shale producers out of business. And I wrote a Forbes article, it went viral, and I was on CNBC over the article. It was called ""OPEC's Trillion Dollar Miscalculation."" And I said, this is going to cost OPEC a trillion dollars. And it did because they crashed the oil market. Oil fell all the way into the 20s back in 2015, 2016, and they did shake out some of the weaker producers. But the shale producers tightened their belts. They came back stronger than ever. And finally OPEC had to wave the white flag. They said, okay, we're not going to do this again. But now they're doing it again. They're out there going, okay, maybe these guys are ripe to squeeze some of them out of the market again. And so OPEC is out overproducing once again. And that's why—that is the biggest reason we have oil sitting around $60 is OPEC has put it there.

Jim Puplava:

So when you take a look at demand, OPEC is saying that it'll go up a little over a million barrels. They're projecting the same for next year. It doesn't look like overall demand is declining, if I read OPEC's numbers right.

Robert Rapier:

Yeah, I don't think it's declining. I think we'll see with the next statistical review. But, you know, we may see it declining in the West or we may see it flattening in the West. Like, take carbon emissions in the United States. Our carbon emissions, you go back 50 years, they're about the same as they were 50 years ago. So our energy consumption per capita, or, you know, it's at least gotten cleaner, so we're not emitting as much. And that's the way it is with oil. Our oil demand has been pretty stable. But developing countries—you know, China, India—oil demand has surged there. And I think that's going to continue to drive it globally. What's going to drive it globally is not countries like the United States consuming more oil. It's billions of people consuming just a little bit more oil. And I think that will drive oil consumption over the next few years, as it has over the past few years.

Jim Puplava:

And let's even talk about transportation. I mean, I think, what is it, electric vehicles here are about 3 or 4% of the auto population? I mean, people are still driving gasoline cars.

Robert Rapier:

Right. And I always use Norway as an example here. Norway had triple-digit growth in electric vehicles for seven years, and they have the highest penetration of electric vehicles on the road—about 30% of the vehicles there are electric. And yet, oil demand over the last 15 years is only down about 10%. So the point I make there is California sometimes says, we don't need oil because we're building out all these electric vehicles. And I say, if you look at Norway, you will see, number one, you're not building out nearly as fast as they are. And yet their oil demand, and it's only been in the past couple of years it's really been affected. So the lesson there is, California, you are still going to need oil for a long time and you're not going to phase it out as fast as you think. One of the issues there, and it shows up on California Energy, the government's own statistics, is as this has happened, as the shale boom happened and left California behind, they have become more dependent on foreign sources of oil, and that has exploded. When you talk about oil as a national security issue for the United States still, it's because of California, because California gets a lot of its oil from the Persian Gulf. And so, if not for that, we really wouldn't be that concerned about what's going on over there. But, you know, if the Strait of Hormuz, for instance, was shut down, it would impact California and have dramatic consequences. And yet California has declared war on the oil industry and is trying to drive the industry out of business.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, and of course, we have the highest gasoline prices in the country. Our prices are almost $2 more a gallon than, let's say, what my son pays in Phoenix.

Robert Rapier:

Yeah. And one of the reasons is you've got very special regulations there. I will tell people, in fairness, California air is a lot cleaner than it was. You know, the LA smog issue from the '70s has largely gone away. But there's a cost to that. And you go, have we gone too far here? Would the air still be clean if the restrictions weren't quite as stringent? Because that keeps California's gasoline specifications so specific that when there's a problem there, gasoline can't flow in from neighboring states because they don't meet the California specifications. And so that's the main reason California is a gasoline island. They can't have gasoline flowing in from these other states if there's an issue. Typically, if you see gasoline prices spike in an area, you'll see jobbers picking up gasoline and moving it into that area to take advantage of those prices. And that ultimately brings the prices back down. That doesn't happen to any significant extent in California.

Jim Puplava:

Well, we got today's headline: ""Exxon takes California to court over compelled climate speech."" And by the end of the year, two more oil companies are shutting down their refineries here. So we're down to about five. And then by the end of the year, Chevron is moving its corporate headquarters after 130 years in California. They're moving to Austin, Texas. So California continues to drive the oil business out of the state.

Robert Rapier:

Right. And from an oil company's perspective, you go, if you don't want me here and you're going to be hostile, yeah, we don't have to be here. You're taxing us more, you're suing us, you're making it difficult for us to do business, you're trying to regulate us out of existence. We'll just pack up and move and you can deal with it. And if you want to—if you think you can run the state on electric, you know, you can run things on electric cars. I mean, you're still going to need all that jet fuel at LAX. You're still going to need diesel for heavy transport. But if you really want to put us out of business, okay, good luck. And that's why California's energy prices are so high.

Jim Puplava:

Well, it's even worse than that because I think as of 2030 or 2035, you can't drive a diesel truck in this state. So how in the heck are they going to get merchandise to stores? So listen, Robert, as you look at this right now from the energy perspective, we like energy. I mean, a lot of these big integrated oil companies have refiners, so they're making profits on that side of the business. The dividends have been solid and they've been going up. Anything else that you think looks attractive here from an energy perspective?

Robert Rapier:

Well, I always talk about midstream, and with this AI infrastructure buildout, the data center buildout, I look at who is going to benefit. So we talked about NRG and the utilities, but the energy companies that supply them with natural gas to produce this power—because a lot of that power is coming from natural gas—so natural gas companies. But the midstream companies. I just published an article today for Utility Forecaster where I talked about how to build a portfolio for income in retirement. And I went through the different areas and I said have about 15% in Master Limited Partnerships and pipeline companies because they are paying 8% pretty safely and sustainably. You've got a company like Enterprise Products Partners, which is in my own portfolio, that's paid 8% as far as the eye can see. You look back, this thing is just a money machine and they are a pipeline and storage company and, you know, very safe. And I say for, you know, that should be a cornerstone in retirement of an income portfolio that's, you know, tax-advantaged income. So midstreams—I really encourage people, especially those seeking income, to really look at the midstream sector because that is less volatile than upstream or downstream and pays better income. On the other hand, it doesn't have as much upside when commodity prices are skyrocketing.

Jim Puplava:

But, you know, who wouldn't want 7 or 8% with the Fed lowering interest rates? Well, listen Robert, as we close, how can people find out more about you? You're a prolific writer. You write for Forbes and you've got other publications. Tell them about it.

Robert Rapier:

Right. So you can find me at Forbes. If you Google ""Robert Rapier Forbes,"" you'll find my Forbes articles. I write at least five articles a month for Forbes covering the entire energy sector. I'm the editor in chief at Shale Magazine, which—we cover the whole energy sector there too. But a lot of my articles will appear there, and we've got other writers there writing about issues that are important to the energy sector. I write several subscription columns for Investing Daily, Utility Forecaster being the biggest one. Despite the name, it's about all income-producing sectors. So, you know, we cover utilities but we cover energy. We cover upstream, midstream, we've got consumer staples, but it's basically helping people try to safely generate income. And then I've got a couple of others there. Also, I publish a free column there every Tuesday. It appears on the Investing Daily homepage and it's always—or it's almost always—some personal finance article, like, you know, we're in open enrollment season right now for healthcare. So I explained to people the advantages of a high-deductible healthcare plan, which I've used myself and can save you a lot of money. So I cover a lot. I cover energy, but I also cover finance and personal finance.

Jim Puplava:

All right, well listen Robert, as always, it's a pleasure having you on the program. Have yourself a great rest of the year.

Holon has signed a preliminary agreement with project developer InLight Real Estate Partners for a facility covering almost 54,000 square meters. The groundbreaking ceremony is planned for April 2026, with commissioning scheduled for the second half of 2027.

Just a few days later, the supply chain is beginning to take shape: US supplier BorgWarner has announced that it will supply NMC battery packs with cylindrical cells and a capacity of 57 kWh for the Holon Urban. Each vehicle will be equipped with two battery packs, giving the Holon Urban a total battery capacity of 114 kWh.

BorgWarner further states that each of the battery packs will be equipped with an integrated, replaceable contact housing and a multi-pack controller. According to the US supplier, the NMC cells will feature “latest generation cell chemistry and benchmark-setting energy density.” However, no data or further information on this is provided. All that is said is that the battery system has a “robust stainless steel battery case and uses a compact, active liquid cooling system”.

BorgWarner will start production of the battery packs in Seneca, South Carolina, in the second quarter of 2027 and will deliver them from there to Jacksonville. Although the origin of the round cells is not specified, several battery projects have been established in the states of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The supplier, therefore, states that the battery system complies with Buy America requirements and the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulation.

German supplier Benteler initially developed its autonomous electric shuttle under its own name, but then spun off the project under the name Holon. Holon unveiled its first e-shuttle at CES in Las Vegas in January 2023. Designed by Pininfarina, the electric Holon Mover is designed to carry up to 15 passengers. It operates automatically (Level 4) at a maximum speed of 60 kph and, according to information available at the time, has a range of approximately 290 kilometres. Production is planned at several locations, including Jacksonville, for the US market. It has not been confirmed whether BorgWarner will also supply the battery packs for the other production sites.

“BorgWarner has extensive experience with smart and integrated battery management systems and excels in energy density, scalability and robust safety certifications – all key components to this exciting new application,” says Henk Vanthournout, Vice President of BorgWarner and President and General Manager, Battery and Charging Systems. “Working with an innovator like HOLON is a great fit for our team. They aim to provide safe, sustainable and inclusive transportation solutions, aligning with our overall sustainability strategy and vision to create a clean, energy-efficient world.”

Flavio Friesen, Vice President of Engineering at Holon, adds: “BorgWarner is a strong fit for HOLON: their battery platform combines benchmark energy density with robust safety, cybersecurity, and serviceability. The modular, liquid-cooled two-pack system integrates perfectly with our shuttle’s packaging and uptime requirements, supporting not only our North American rollout, but also the demands in Europe and the Middle East regions.”

Held at LiUNA’s facility in Minneapolis, the event featured a diverse panel of experts discussing the topic of nuclear energy. In attendance were legislators, business leaders, energy industry professionals, environmental advocates and other stakeholders.

“We need a firm clean, baseload solution,” Taylor Stevenson, CEO of Envoy Public Labs, said. “The extreme need for energy has brought nuclear to the forefront.” Stevenson said, warning that other states near Minnesota are advancing nuclear energy and may look to sell the power to Minnesota.

“Minnesota is way behind,” he said. “We need to open up the conversation about nuclear energy.” Other speakers agreed with this sentiment.

“To take nuclear off the table is a mistake,” Michael Noble, principal, NobleIdeas, said.

“We are seeing other states open to nuclear; Minnesota is an outlier,” Aaron Rosenthal, North Star Policy Action, said. “There is a real contradiction here. We want to reach the goal but not allow the most practical and affordable way to meet it.”

One key advantage of nuclear that was highlighted is that it can be dependably adjusted to meet demand day and night.

“We are going to need clean, dispatchable resources to replace coal,” said Sydnie Lieb, assistant commissioner, Minnesota Department of Commerce. “You can run dispatchable as long as you need it, until you shut it off,” she said.

The forum also highlighted the economic contributions of nuclear energy, particularly in job creation and community development.

“Nuclear provides more jobs for a longer time,” said Kevin Pranis, Minesota State Building and Construction Trades Council, while comparing nuclear energy to other types of energy resources. Rosenthal also underscored the quality and sustainability of employment opportunities tied to the nuclear industry, noting the jobs pay well and positively impact local economies.

Other panelists included Philip Hult, Generation Atomic; Pam Gorman Prochaska, Xcel Energy; Darrick Moe, Minnesota Rural Electric Association; and Kristy Hartman, with the Nuclear Energy Institute. Blake Johnson, representing the Prairie Island Indian Community, participated and shared the viewpoint and concerns of the tribal community, which sits nearby the existing Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant.

Additionally, North Star Policy Action and Rosenthal presented a newly released report detailing the far-reaching benefits of nuclear energy in Minnesota. The report identified three core advantages: climate benefits, workforce benefits, and state and regional benefits. The findings highlighted nuclear energy’s minor carbon footprint in comparison to all other fuel types, including renewables. Economic gains include significant tax revenue for local communities, increased household incomes due to indirect jobs and stability created by long-term employment opportunities tied to nuclear power generation.

In a rare shift, Mr. Zeldin is reconsidering his announcement from May that he would end the program, which triggered intense pushback from business leaders and congressional Republicans, according to four people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

Shortly after Mr. Zeldin said he would eliminate Energy Star, the E.P.A. renewed four contracts with ICF, a consulting firm that helps administer the program, according to federal records. One contract was renewed through September of 2030. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

In addition to Deep River Data, Spuller is the executive vice president of industry aﬀairs for the Blockchain Association, headquartered in Washington, D.C.","A company with connections to the cryptocurrency industry is considering drilling for natural gas near the Deep River north of Sanford in Lee County, North Carolina.

If approved, the project would be the first commercial well drilled into the Triassic Basin, a natural gas repository underlying North Carolina and other Eastern Seaboard states.

Deep River Data, based in Alamance County, is interested in accessing gas from Butler Well No. 3, just south of U.S. Highway 421 near the Lee-Chatham county line, according to emails obtained under public records law.

Company adviser Dan Spuller, who is both a crypto entrepreneur and a natural gas landman, contacted the state Oil & Gas Commission in September about applying for a drilling unit, a parcel of land where drilling would occur. He said the natural gas would be for a data center to power “AI workloads,” not crypto mining. Both applications are energy-intensive, running server farms around the clock to power streams of computer computations.

“We want to submit a packet that is complete on first impression—avoiding delays and making the Commission’s review as straightforward as possible,” Spuller wrote.

Duke Energy recently projected data centers could add nearly 6 gigawatts to demand in North Carolina, which has prompted the construction of new natural gas plants and pipelines, major sources of planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide.

Methane, which leaks upstream from well heads, pipelines and compressor stations, traps 86 times more heat over 20 years than carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, which power plants emit when burning fossil fuels.

Nationwide, some data centers have not only tapped into the grid but revived shuttered coal and nuclear plants for their power. The Lee County project would tap into the natural gas reserves in the Deep River Basin, which spans 150 miles over 11 counties in central and southern North Carolina.

Spuller told Inside Climate News the company will use conventional drilling, rather than fracking, to produce the gas. Fracking is a particularly destructive type of extraction. It requires horizontal drilling beneath the ground and often uses toxic chemicals mixed with large volumes of water injected at high pressures to crack the shale formations and free the gas trapped within small fissures.

Fracking is legal in North Carolina, but has never been deployed. Lee County enacted two-year fracking moratoria in 2017 and in 2019; both have expired.

“We are evaluating whether the well can safely and efficiently produce gas using conventional methods,” Spuller said. “It remains in a pre-feasibility phase—we are still evaluating whether development is even viable. Nothing has been approved, permitted or built.”

Butler Well No. 3 was drilled vertically in 1998 to a depth of 2,655 feet, according to a 2011 report by the North Carolina Geological Survey. The well lies within a geological region of black shale and old coal deposits, a legacy of the area’s mining history.

“The Oil and Gas Commission must look carefully at this proposal to exploit the gas well near the Deep River, as well as those who want to develop it,” said Therese Vick of the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League. “It is incumbent on the commission to do its due diligence. Having worked with communities in Lee and Chatham Counties for over a decade, my concerns are many.”

Depending on their size, data centers can also consume enormous amounts of water to cool their computer servers. The project would be less than a tenth of a mile from the Deep River and Patterson Creek.

Spuller said water use “would be minimal” and that “there are no plans to withdraw water from the Deep River.”

The project could tap into groundwater or a public water main that runs along the north side of U.S. Highway 421.

The company is considering closed-loop systems and other sustainable options, he said. Some closed-loop systems, however, use more energy to run the coolers.

The project will likely need standard utility interconnections, Spuller said, such as electricity, fiber and “basic access roads typical of small-scale data facilities. There are no heavy-industrial or extraction components proposed.”

The state Geological Survey noted that Butler Well No. 3 is located within three and a half miles of a 6-inch distribution line to the Sanford Industrial Park, “which has large volume gas users.”

Stephanie Stephens, the Deep River Riverkeeper, said she’s concerned the project could be a harbinger of more data centers along the Carolina Core, an area that includes Sanford and is targeted for economic development.

“We would like to be choosy about the types of industry that come in,” she said.

The proposed data center would also be near the new Boone Trail kayak and canoe access site.

The Deep River is a troubled waterway. Nearly 23 miles are on the federal impaired waters list, and it contains 1,4-Dioxane, a likely carcinogen, discharged from the City of Asheboro’s wastewater treatment plant. Another 131 miles of tributaries to the river are also impaired, state records show.

“We already have a polluted river,” Stephens said.

Lee County records show Butler Well No. 3 is on a 643-acre forested tract owned by Ed Myrick of Pompano Beach, Florida. However, Dan Butler, who lives in Southern Pines, purchased the mineral rights beneath that property in 1975 from the previous land owner, Weyerhauser, the timber company.

Butler owns more than 2,700 acres of mineral rights in Lee County, state records show.

Since 1998, several companies have conducted exploratory drilling of Butler Well No. 3. However, given the comparatively small amount of gas and lack of a pipeline to transport it, they determined it wasn’t economically feasible and abandoned their projects.

Butler is a third-generation oil and gas developer. His grandparents were born in western Pennsylvania, where he owns “oil wells being drilled by the hundreds in the Alleghany State Forest,” according to a transcript of his comments at a 2012 Legislative Research Commission meeting.

Butler’s father, Howard, was the superintendent of the Coal Glen Mine in Chatham County in 1925 when it exploded and killed 53 men.

It’s uncertain whether the property, which currently allows residential and agricultural uses, would need to be rezoned. There are no provisions for data centers in Lee County’s current unified development ordinance, said County Zoning Administrator Thomas Mierisch. The UDO went into effect in 2006, before data centers and cryptomines “were really a thing,” Miersch said.

Spuller became a registered landman in North Carolina in 2021, according to state Department of Environmental Quality records. In this capacity Spuller can negotiate business agreements for exploration or development of natural gas.

Although Deep River Data officials also work for other cryptocurrency interests, Spuller said the project would not be a cryptomine. “It is envisioned as a modular data-infrastructure project” that would include AI workloads and other compute-intensive research, he said.

Deep River Data was incorporated on April 30, according to the North Carolina Secretary of State business registry. The company’s officers work in cryptocurrency: Spuller, Dan Fisher and Gerald Wilkie, Jr. A separate Wilkie-run enterprise, HM Tech, which operates out of a large, blue warehouse on South Maple Street in Graham, is listed as a “managing member” of Deep River Data.

HM Tech is a bitcoin mining facility and repair center. Two other top executives, Alun Williams and Murray Stahl, are with Horizon Kinetics, a New York-based investment firm whose funds include cryptocurrency.

Wilkie was among 55 cryptocurrency company representatives who signed a letter in 2022 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan disputing the industry’s environmental harm. Two dozen congressional Democrats had previously sent a letter to Regan expressing their “serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.”

Wilkie signed the letter in his role as founder and president of HMTech.

“There are no pollutants, including carbon dioxide, released by digital asset mining,” the cryptocurrency companies wrote. “Associated emissions are a function of electricity generation, which is a consequence of policy choices and economic realities shaping the nature of the electrical grid. Digital asset miners simply buy electricity that is made available to them on the open market, just the same as any industrial buyer.

“It is imperative that elected officials in the United States recognize that bitcoin … is the most important financial, economic, and accounting innovation in the history of humanity.”

Wilkie did not respond to an email and voicemail from Inside Climate News requesting an interview.

In addition to Deep River Data, Spuller is the executive vice president of industry aﬀairs for the Blockchain Association, headquartered in Washington, D.C. However, Deep River Data is separate from that work, he said.

Earlier in his career, Spuller worked as the communications director for former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory’s inaugural committee. Spuller parlayed that connection for a marketing position at the state Department of Commerce, according to his LinkedIn page, where he worked closely with the Office of the Commissioner of Banks to help negotiate and pass the North Carolina Money Transmitters Act of 2016.

Former Lt. Gov. Dan Forest appointed Spuller to the North Carolina Blockchain Initiative in 2019, where he was a co-chairman and member until this year. From 2016 to 2020, he led membership and growth at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

On Oct. 20, Spuller, representing the Blockchain Association, and Eric Peterson, senior government affairs manager at Kraken Digital Assets Exchange, appeared before the first state House Select Committee on Blockchain and Digital Assets.

They were advocating for legislation favorable to stablecoin, which is considered less volatile than other types of cryptocurrency. It can also be used to transfer funds between different crypto tokens.

Spuller was urging the passage of House Bill 92, the North Carolina Digital Assets Investment Act. It would authorize the state treasurer to invest a portion of public funds in the digital assets, study employment employee investment options, and evaluate the creation of a state-level digital asset reserve.

This measure passed the House earlier this year, but is still waiting for Senate approval.

“Hopefully they will pass it because I think that would also send really a fantastic message to the global economy that our state’s open for business,” Spuller said. “There’s no reason not to pass that. That would be on my wish list.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2198893774-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 06:58:53.557473

The Kent Cos. has acquired 15 Chevron-branded convenience stores from Ponchatoula, Louisiana-based B&B Petroleum. | The Kent Cos.

The Kent Cos. has acquired 15 Chevron-branded convenience stores from Ponchatoula, Louisiana-based B&B Petroleum. This marks the Midland, Texas-based retailer’s entrance into its ninth state, Louisiana.

The deal, announced on Friday, also includes B&B Petroleum’s Subway and Red Bird Café locations.

The Kent Cos. is No. 61 on CSP’s 2025 Top 202 ranking of U.S. convenience-store chains by store count.

The 15 c-stores will transition to the Kent Kwik brand, The Kent Cos. said.

“We are thrilled to officially enter the Louisiana market and continue growing the Kent Kwik footprint across the Southeast,” said Bill Kent, owner and CEO of The Kent Cos. “B&B Petroleum has built a strong reputation for quality and community, which perfectly aligns with our family values and brand promise of ‘Making Your Life Easy’ for our guests and team members.”

The Kent Cos. now has 130 company-owned c-stores and travel centers across nine states, and it supplies fuels to more than 150 dealer sites across six states. The expansion into Louisiana is a natural progression of its five-year growth strategy, the company said, aimed at extending eastward from its Texas roots.

The Kent Cos. remains a Chevron Texaco brand partner, it said.

The owners of B&B Petroleum LLC, Art Bonneval and Jay Barzenick, said in a joint statement: “It has been an incredible journey building and growing B&B Petroleum over the years. We are proud of what our team has accomplished and the strong relationships we’ve built with our customers and partners. We believe this acquisition with Kent Cos. aligns with our values and marks a meaningful step forward that will allow the business to continue evolving and serving its customers. As we close this chapter, we leave with immense gratitude for everyone who has been part of this journey and pride in all that we’ve achieved together.”

WILDEMAN,,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fast-chargers-expanding-quickly-american-131229919.html,"KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle.

Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.","KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn't buy an EV. That's significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That's a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans' anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that's long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut's state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He's taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

“With the passage of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, Illinois is standing up to President Trump’s dismantling of the clean energy economy and boldly leading the way forward.
This is how we protect Illinoisans from bill spikes and grow Illinois’ clean energy economy.","The Illinois Senate passed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act, also known as SB25, on Thursday. The bill passed the House on Wednesday, so it's now headed to the governor's desk. It's a move that's getting mixed reactions.

State Senator Jil Tracy (R-Quincy) issued a statement criticizing the passage of the ""so-called 'Energy Omnibus Bill.'""

“Democratic policies have created a mess for Illinois families, and this latest energy bill only digs the hole deeper,"" Senator Tracy said. ""Just when we thought things couldn’t get more chaotic after the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), this proposal removes crucial protections, hands unelected bureaucrats unchecked power to raise utility rates, and risks closing reliable local power plants while subsidizing unreliable energy. The result? Families face skyrocketing bills while billions flow to special interest groups and not to the people who actually pay the bills. Illinoisans deserve affordable, reliable energy, not this mess.”

The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition says the bill protects consumers from energy price spikes and safeguards Illinois’ climate commitments made in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.

“With the passage of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, Illinois is standing up to President Trump’s dismantling of the clean energy economy and boldly leading the way forward. At a time when utility bills are rising due to unprecedented demand for energy, largely driven by data centers, Illinois is taking decisive action to mitigate rising costs while solidifying our clean energy economy for generations to come,"" the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition said in a statement Thursday night.

“The CRGA Act makes transformative investments in the most cost-effective, reliable resources needed to meet growing demand: battery storage, energy efficiency, and wind and solar. This is how we protect Illinoisans from bill spikes and grow Illinois’ clean energy economy. It is also how we step away from the status quo of Illinois families paying too much to prop up expensive dirty energy plants that pad the profits of out of state fossil fuel corporations instead of building cost-effective, new clean energy resources that are better for consumers and boost economic development. We applaud the General Assembly for taking action.

“As Illinois steps forward to responsibly tackle our energy and affordability challenges, this victory must be followed by legislative action in the spring 2026 session to ensure that Big Tech and data centers, the primary driver of rising utility bills, join the solution instead of continuing to be the problem. Illinois has proven that it can tackle complex energy policy issues while keeping equity, consumers, and worker protections at the forefront, and the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition looks forward to working with stakeholders next spring to build on that progress.”

The Illinois Manufacturers’ Association says the sweeping energy proposal doesn't go far enough to address the underlying issues. The association said in a statement Thursday night the bill will result in massive electric rate hikes on businesses and consumers.

“Manufacturers need reliable and affordable energy to produce the goods consumers rely on, including food, pharmaceuticals, machinery and household products. Unfortunately, this proposal repeats mistakes of the past, raising costs on manufacturers and working families without addressing underlying capacity and supply issues that are projected to lead to energy shortfalls,” said Mark Denzler, President and CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. “While there are some provisions of this legislation we support, including lifting the moratorium on nuclear facilities, more work needs to be done to strengthen our state’s energy marketplace, protect consumers and encourage long-term economic investment. We remain committed to offering workable solutions, including advocating for an all-of-the-above approach that includes renewables, maintains operations at current baseload plants, adds new power generation, and invests in more transmission lines and affordable technologies.”",https://foxillinois.com/resources/media/a01141ed-4601-4554-ad4d-320d65970e2a-IMG_0532.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 11:21:06.745918

The comments urge the agency to fully reallocate the impacts of Small Refinery Exemptions (SRE) and finalize the rule before year’s end.

“We appreciate the important step EPA is taking with this supplemental proposal to rectify and reallocate the impacts of SREs issued for the 2023 and 2024 RFS compliance years, as well as reallocation for SREs anticipated for 2025,” said ACE CEO Brian Jennings in written comments. “If the volumes of renewable fuel represented by the SREs are not reallocated, obligated parties could use the oversupply of low-priced RINs to satisfy future renewable volume obligations instead of buying and blending physical gallons of ethanol and other renewable fuel. This type of demand destruction would undermine the integrity of the RFS.”

ACE emphasized that history has shown how harmful SREs can be to ethanol demand. “SRE-induced demand destruction occurred in 2018 and 2019 when D6 RIN values cratered from $1.00 per gallon to $0.20 or less following EPA’s decision to grant 85 SREs covering the 2016 through 2018 compliance years,” Jennings noted. “More than 4 billion gallons of blending obligations were effectively erased for refiners through EPA’s action at that time, discouraging refiners from blending ethanol above E10 and restraining sales of E15, E30, and E85.”

Jennings said EPA has an opportunity to prevent that from happening again. “EPA must reallocate 100% of the 2023 through 2025 exempted RVOs — an estimated 2.18 billion gallons — to the final Set 2 rule. The 100% full reallocation approach is the only way to ensure blending obligations remain whole for 2026 and 2027.”

Beyond reallocation, ACE reiterated support for EPA’s proposal to set record-high renewable fuel volumes and encouraged EPA to consider conventional biofuel levels exceeding 15 billion gallons to offset potential export market losses and ensure conventional ethanol maintains its role in the fuel supply.

ACE’s comments also backed EPA’s proposal to reduce RIN generation for imported fuels and foreign feedstocks and called for improvements to the agency’s lifecycle modeling for biofuels. “We encourage EPA to modify its methodology to align with real-world observations and actions taken by Congress, including use of GREET and GTAP-BIO modeling approaches,” Jennings said.

Finally, ACE pressed EPA to act swiftly. “It is imperative to finalize this rulemaking before the end of the 2025 calendar year to get the RFS back on track and provide certainty to all parties,” Jennings concluded.",https://cstoredecisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ace-logo.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 13:05:54.058593

That’s when Ford plans to start building a lower-cost, all-electric pickup starting at $30,000. By the end of that year, Panasonic is set to be making a breakthrough battery that can add nearly a hundred miles of range to the popular Tesla Model Y, according to Electrek.

That’s about 450 miles of distance, leaving range anxiety with road dust. Japan-headquartered Panasonic is a key Tesla supplier that has long been making headlines for battery innovations. Next, its experts intend to develop a pack that doesn’t include an anode during production. It’s a move that may leave battery buffs wondering how the concept gets past the basic lithium-ion workflow.

“Interesting idea. I hope it pans out,” an Electrek reader commented on a story about the innovation.

They pull it off with lithium metal inside the pack that forms the crucial anode during the first charge cycle, according to Reuters. This leaves more space for valuable cathode materials. When a battery operates, ions move between the two electrodes through a substance called an electrolyte, according to a U.S. Department of Energy fact sheet.

The manufacturing method will allow Panasonic to increase capacity without changing the volume. Experts also hope to reduce the amount of expensive nickel needed for the cathode, the Reuters story added.

Lower-cost batteries and EVs would seemingly be a byproduct, but Panasonic didn’t give the news agency details on production costs.

Globally, 2025 EV and plug-in hybrid sales are expected to increase 25% year-over-year, to 22 million vehicles, according to BloombergNEF. The Panasonic innovation has the potential to provide another boost to the sector.

“I’m always wary of ‘battery breakthrough’ announcements, as they rarely pan out to anything substantial, but if they can deliver a 25% increase in energy density at a reasonable cost with longevity, it could be a winner,” Electrek’s Fred Lambert wrote. Energy density is the amount of electricity that can be stored per pound.

The company made news last year for innovations that promised a wider range. It has also been pioneering silicon anode technology to diversify component supply chains and improve performance.

Reliable EVs are already on the road, as the median range for model year 2024 is 283 miles. Each one that replaces a gas-guzzler prevents thousands of pounds of air pollution annually, according to the DOE.

What’s more, tailpipe gases are associated with health risks and deaths, according to Harvard researchers. That’s in addition to contributing to our planet’s overheating.

Certain states still offer perks for buying and charging an EV. And owners of the cleaner rides enjoy $1,500 a year in gas and service savings. Adding a rooftop solar array and a battery backup can provide free solar energy for charging. Federal tax breaks for the systems expire on Dec. 31, making fast action important.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.","FORT COLLINS, Colo (AP) — President Donald Trump's efforts to help the U.S. coal industry at home are being undermined by falling sales abroad amid his trade war with China, new government reports show.

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,"" coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to ""keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

More than 6,680 Mesa County residents obtained health coverage through the marketplace for 2025.
If a tax credit extension is included in the continuing resolution, the spike in individual insurance premiums would see more than an 80% reduction.
“We’re that one-stop shop for health care coverage — especially financially assisted health care coverage, either through Connect for Health or through the state of Colorado,” Cubel said.
“Their condition of reopening the government is that we need to pass the enhanced premium tax credits,” Hurd said.","Coloradans with individual insurance, commonly known as Obamacare or Affordable Care Act insurance, could be paying double their current premiums by the start of next year.

With open enrollment underway as of today, that reality becomes increasingly likely. However, there are still opportunities to reverse the inflation apparent in the new plan prices.

More than 6,680 Mesa County residents obtained health coverage through the marketplace for 2025.

“Right now, I pay about $450 a month for my insurance plan. I recently learned that my premium could double to about $900 a month … that is $6,000 more per year out of my pocket,” Aubrey Hix, an independently contracted business consultant, said in a press briefing.

“I’m an independent voter. This is not about politics for me.”“I don’t care if you have a D or an R next to your name, because I have neither. I care about if you’re voting to reduce my costs or not. I care about if you’re looking out for me.”

ARE THE NEW PRICES PERMANENT?

National Public Radio reported that the current government shutdown stemmed from Senate Democrats’ refusal to approve the continued government funding resolution that passed the House, primarily because it did not extend the credits set to expire by the end of this year.

If a tax credit extension is included in the continuing resolution, the spike in individual insurance premiums would see more than an 80% reduction.

When the shutdown started on Oct. 1, Democratic lawmakers intended to obtain that extension before November, when official prices would become available and enrollees could select their coverage for 2026.

Anna Cubel, who supervises Hilltop’s local enrollment assistance program (Health Access) for Obamacare, Medicaid and the Child Health Plan Plus, said it would have been ideal if the decision were made before open enrollment, but it isn’t a hard cut-off.

“If they (Congress) do decide to extend them in one facet or another, we’ll be able to reach out to our clients and have them come back in,” Cubel said. “It means a little bit more work for us, but that’s OK. This is our time to shine.”

She added that clients wouldn’t have to take action to receive the credits retroactively, but it’s advised that they review their options with the new prices to ensure they receive the highest-quality plan they can afford.

While Hilltop Health Access can provide such updates to clients, they don’t work with enrollees who select plans on their own or with insurance brokers.

Those who are not connected to Health Access should keep their eye on the news and the marketplace website to ensure they are up-to-date. Those interested in connecting with Health Access can receive walk-in assistance at various Mesa County Libraries locations through the first week of November:

Nov. 3 – Clifton Library, 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

Nov. 4 – Palisade Library, 9 a.m. to noon and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.

Nov. 5 – Central Library, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Nov. 7 – Fruita Library, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Alternatively, those interested can schedule an appointment by visiting www.htop.org/health-access.

“We’re that one-stop shop for health care coverage — especially financially assisted health care coverage, either through Connect for Health or through the state of Colorado,” Cubel said. “But we’re not employed by either entity, so we’re not biased in any way. We’re just here to help people.”

Colorado also made a one-time extension to its marketplace enrollment period this year, allowing residents to enroll as late as Jan. 15 (with coverage going into effect February). If enrollees select a plan before the usual deadline, Dec. 15, their coverage starts with the new year.

HOW LIKELY IS AN EXTENSION?

As of publication, with the shutdown still underway, there’s no clear indication from Congress on which direction it will take.

But there are two most likely outcomes: Democrats concede to reopening the government without an extension, or Republicans agree to include an extension in the continued funding resolution. Either choice would likely be due to mounting pressure over frozen federal programs and federal employees going unpaid.

House Representative Jeff Hurd, R-D3, said he has heard from many Mesa County residents and constituents across his district about the importance of these tax credits in keeping healthcare affordable.

Although not a permanent solution, Hurd said he is open to extending the credit by at least a year, but not through the continued funding resolution required to reopen the government.

“Their condition of reopening the government is that we need to pass the enhanced premium tax credits,” Hurd said. “We cannot hold the government hostage because of a policy issue. It’s wrong when Republicans did it, and it’s now wrong when Democrats are doing it.”

“…we need to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, temporarily, to help alleviate the immediate issue of skyrocketing health insurance premiums,” he added. “But fundamentally, the enhanced premium tax credits are just addressing the symptom, which is a healthcare system that is extremely expensive.”

He added that he is already on a bill that would extend the credits through the end of the year, but it cannot pass until the government re-opens.

That bill, the Bipartisan Premium Tax Credit Extension Act, was introduced into the House nearly one month before the shutdown began, where it has yet to pass since being referred to a House committee. It currently boasts 28 co-sponsors, 14 Democrats and 14 Republicans.

Many of Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress, however, said that the bill is simply “kicking the can down the road,” and will put the legislature (and enrollees) in the same predicament next year.

House Rep. Jason Crow, CD-6, and Sen. John Hickenlooper both told the Sentinel they believe the best solution is a permanent extension of the credits, adding that Republicans maintain full control of Congress and the White House, yet refuse to discuss any compromise.

“Working families deserve real relief, not a bill that puts a temporary (bandage) on the problem for a year and then causes health care premiums to soar again,” Crow said.

“Republicans must come back from their vacations, do their jobs and work with Democrats to pass a budget that reopens the government and lowers health care costs,” he added.

Hickenlooper’s office added that the bill permanently extending the enhanced premium tax credits is already in the Senate, whereas there is no guarantee that the one-year extension bill would make it past the House when the government reopens.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/22/a2273dec-76f2-475e-9f80-365a55b552ea/687fe7d5b2010.image.jpg?crop=1731%2C909%2C0%2C122&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-01 05:01:30.917281

There is already plenty of existing research that shows that shipwrecks create a new ecosystem.
But whether they pull fish from natural reefs or promote production of new fish (known as the attraction-pollution hypothesis) has historically been hard to say.
Early data, according to Baillie, shows that the wrecks have attracted fish from natural reefs and created a habitat for new ones to reproduce, including those that are endangered.
“It seems to come from an earnest place of ‘we must protect and we must understand.’ That is incredibly refreshing to find.”","Sitting at the bottom of the Gulf of Thailand about 20 metres below the ocean surface is the HTMS Hanhak Sattru. Snappers, yellowtail fusiliers and bannerfish swim through the ship’s corridors,while barnacles, algae and young coral cling to the iron ladders and machine-gun on deck. Nearby is another wreck, the HTMS SuphairinBoth were intentionally submerged by the Royal Thai Navy in 2023 to create artificial reefs and dive sites. Their planned scuttling has enabled marine scientists to produce some of the first research on how much shipwrecks change the marine environment.

There is already plenty of existing research that shows that shipwrecks create a new ecosystem. But whether they pull fish from natural reefs or promote production of new fish (known as the attraction-pollution hypothesis) has historically been hard to say.

“It’s hard to get that information from shipwrecks because the majority of them have gone down by accident,” explained Piers Baillie, the founder and director of the marine research centre Global Reef, located on the holiday island of Koh Tao. In this case, however, working with the navy and department of marine and coastal resources, Global Reef was able to collect data before and after HTMS Hanhak Sattru and HTMS Suphairin were sent to the bottom of the ocean.

Early data, according to Baillie, shows that the wrecks have attracted fish from natural reefs and created a habitat for new ones to reproduce, including those that are endangered. “Like anything in science, there’s a slightly nuanced approach to things where we’ve seen potential evidence to support strongly the attraction side of the hypothesis. However, we’re also seeing that there are these juveniles arriving at the shipwrecks.”

This is important because if fish are reproducing on the wreck that means they can be used as a tool to boost fish stocks in a context where numbers are depleting owing to climate change and overtourism. If the wreck is pulling fish away from a natural reef, that may have consequences for nearby natural reefs’ ecosystems, but it could also offer species a level of protection from fishing. These shipwrecks – along with a handful of others purposely sunk in the country – are popular dive sites and the presence of dive boats acts as a deterrent to fishers, he explained, while commercial vessels are unable to trawl a shipwreck.

Shipwrecks already offer an alternative spot for divers to explore, reducing the pressure on natural reefs, according to Iain Suthers, professor at the School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences at the University of New South Wales.

Many reefs are succumbing to warming ocean temperatures, physical damage from boats, and coral diseases. Several species that live in the clear waters of Koh Tao, such as stingrays, groupers and bamboo sharks, are also endangered. But here, in one of the most popular dive sites globally, is some of Thailand’s worst underwater damage. More than 500,000 tourists a year arrive on the country’s wooden dock, many of whom are eager to spend their days in the sea with one of the island’s 80-plus dive schools, spotting whale sharks, turtles and sweet lips. Their presence puts the natural ecosystem in danger.

“We need to have a tourism industry that can see and harvest fish. We need to have these sorts of structures to improve the fishery,” Suthers said. “I think the future is in these areas of the ocean – less than 200 metres deep, such as the Gulf of Thailand – to use [artificial reefs] to facilitate the fish to harvest.”

The country has been installing different types of artificial reefs since the 1970s and has scattered thousands of structures, including other ships, along Thailand’s two main coastlines. “There’s been a lot of proactivity in terms of trying to pursue best practices for coral conservation, whether it’s active restoration [or] habitat creation, more than any other country that I have worked in or seen or even learned about,” said Dr Rahul Mehrotra, research director at Aow Thai Marine Ecology Center. Thailand has committed to the international conservation goal of protecting 30% of the world’s land and ocean by 2030 while also looking for ways to safeguard its own marine ecosystems, in part because of the tourism revenue they generate.

Shipwrecks, with their nooks, passageways and air of mystery, are a way of potentially protecting them. “Artificial reefs and particularly shipwrecks are providing habitats to these valuable, heavily targeted potentially threatened species,” said Baillie whose team of six scientists and around 16 interns spends its days wetsuit-clad, oxygen tanks in tow and research questions at the ready.

That such research is being supported by the government is significant, said Mehrotra. “It’s refreshing, as a conservationist and now as an ecologist, to see officials behind the nation seeming to take the future needs of the marine ecosystem seriously.” He believes that’s because of the Buddhist country’s spiritual, religious and cultural relationship with wildlife. “Its relationship with the sea and its relationship with wildlife is deeply ingrained in the identity of Thailand,” said Mehrotra. “It seems to come from an earnest place of ‘we must protect and we must understand.’ That is incredibly refreshing to find.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6cb51b9fc0d00f75f5c1fa81c666901c765b072/456_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=56ce045ae69d391a4456e673af50ceb8",N,,2025-11-01 06:58:45.074102

On October 29, senior business leaders, government representatives, and international partners came together in Toronto for the B7 Energy Ministerial Side Event, hosted by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).

As part of Canada’s 2025 G7 Presidency and the Canadian Chamber’s leadership as B7 President, the event built on momentum from the B7 Summit in Ottawa earlier this year — advancing dialogue on one of the world’s most pressing challenges: How to deliver energy security and economic growth while accelerating the global transition toward a net-zero future.

The Canadian Chamber is grateful to have been joined by distinguished speakers and partners who contributed to this important dialogue:

A Defining Moment for Canada’s B7 Presidency

The Business 7 (B7) is the official voice of the global business community within the G7 framework, providing policy recommendations that reflect the priorities of the private sector. Under Canada’s presidency, the B7 is focused on strengthening economic resilience, competitiveness, and energy security while ensuring that sustainability and inclusion remain at the core of the conversation.

This side event marked a key milestone in Canada’s B7 year — translating the priorities outlined in the 2025 B7 Communiqué into practical dialogue and policy collaboration. The insights shared in Toronto will help inform the broader G7 process, including future G7 ministerial meetings.

Energy Security and Economic Stability Go Hand in Hand

In a time of global volatility — from geopolitical instability to shifting trade and energy markets — participants emphasized that energy security is economic security. Canada’s reputation as a stable, responsible and innovative supplier of energy positions it as a cornerstone in building a more reliable global system.

Speakers underscored that the path to a low-carbon future cannot come at the expense of reliability or affordability. The world’s economies will succeed in their energy transitions only if they can deliver on both. This balance — among security, sustainability, and competitiveness — was echoed throughout the day and remains central to the B7’s call for investment in a “secure and clean energy economy.”

Technology as an Enabler — Not a Silver Bullet

Innovation and emerging technologies were identified as critical levers for accelerating progress toward net zero. From artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure to small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced energy systems, technological advancements hold the potential to transform how economies produce and consume energy.

However, participants also noted that technology alone is not enough. Unlocking innovation requires predictable policy environments, agile regulation, and deep collaboration between the public and private sectors. At the same time, digitalization itself carries an energy cost — meaning that as the world becomes more data-driven, managing the energy footprint of innovation will be essential to sustainability goals.

The discussion reflected a shared understanding: Innovation must go hand in hand with good governance and international cooperation to achieve a resilient energy future.

Critical Minerals — Building the Foundations of the Future

Critical minerals — from lithium and nickel to rare earth elements — were highlighted as the backbone of the clean energy and advanced manufacturing economies. Participants recognized that these resources are no longer peripheral to economic strategy; they are central to energy independence, technological innovation, and geopolitical stability.

Speakers called for greater investment certainty, infrastructure development, and responsible mining practices that strengthen both domestic and global supply chains. They emphasized that competitiveness and conscience must coexist — ensuring that the race to meet global demand is paired with environmental stewardship and social responsibility.

Indigenous Partnership and Inclusive Growth

A consistent thread throughout the discussions was the importance of inclusion and trust — particularly in how Canada approaches its resource economy. Indigenous Peoples are not just stakeholders but key partners in shaping Canada’s energy future.

This was powerfully underscored by Crystal Smith, Senior Fellow for Energy and Partnerships at Energy for a Secure Future, and former Chief Councillor of the Haisla Nation, who shared the story of the Cedar LNG Project — a majority Indigenous-owned initiative that embodies partnership, equity, and shared prosperity.

Looking Ahead: From Dialogue to Delivery

As the 2025 B7 Presidency continues, Canada’s role is not only to convene but to catalyze — turning discussion into action and ambition into tangible progress.

The B7 Energy Ministerial underscored that no country, company or community can achieve the energy transition alone. Collaboration across sectors, borders and perspectives will be the key to advancing a future that is secure, inclusive and sustainable.

As B7 President for the next two months, the Canadian Chamber will continue to champion the voice of business on the global stage — ensuring that Canada’s leadership drives meaningful outcomes for businesses, workers and communities worldwide.

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,” coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to “keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. The rest was thermal coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, according to Blumenfeld.

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.

Appalachia would therefore benefit most from a resumption of U.S. coal exports to China, noted Blumenfeld by email.

“There is optimism,” Blumenfeld wrote. “But there is little documentation to back that up right now.”

Most coal headed for China last year went through Baltimore, with lesser amounts via the Norfolk, Virginia, area and Gulf of Mexico, according to Blumenfeld.

Relatively little thermal coal from the Western U.S. is exported due to the cost of hauling it by rail to the West Coast, where there has also been political resistance to building port facilities to export more coal.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/10/69053e23a2e240.28948460.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-01 06:02:01.292354

A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states.
This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed.
If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.
It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease.","Who wants higher electricity rates? Ask just about anyone and they’ll agree that energy prices have risen. They’re not wrong. In recent weeks there has been significant attention in the Mountain State on what is driving those costs. The question has no doubt arisen from people seeing their electricity bills steadily rise, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic five years ago. A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states. For example:

• West Virginia: +27.71%

• Ohio: +30.11%

• Pennsylvania: +30.85%

• Virginia: +19.78%

• Kentucky: +17.66%

• North Carolina: +24.17%

• Texas: +27.58%

Power rates have risen by a quarter or more in five of those states. Virginia has seen slower rate increases due to significant growth in Northern Virginia, and Kentucky’s increases are significantly offset by subsidies from the Tennessee Valley Authority in the western part of the state.

With the backdrop of these prices, some politicians in the West Virginia Legislature have announced plans to introduce legislation that requires coal-fired power plants in West Virginia to at least run at 69% capacity all the time or forego the ability to recoup future costs. The claim is that coal is a cheap fuel source and that such a bill will lower electric rates and put nearly 3,500 coal miners back to work. If it sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is.

Your power company understands the best way to keep your rates as low as possible is to participate in the market. For our region, that market is PJM. PJM is making constant decisions about how to provide the least expensive and most efficient power. One of the key drivers in that decision is what the fuel needed to run the power plant (coal, gas or nuclear) costs. Another is going to be what the power grid needs at any given moment to provide reliable electricity to our state and region.

On a windy day, wind turbines will be called upon to provide a decent share of the power on the grid. If it’s not as windy, that won’t be the case. It’s the same with sunny days and

solar farms. The wind and sun don’t charge for their fuel, so instead those electricity costs are largely driven by the hard physical costs (solar panels, windmills) that have already been factored into the capacity market. The intermittent nature of renewable energy, however, means that those energy sources will supplement what is on the grid, but won’t provide the baseload power that is required.

That brings us to the fuel sources that can provide the baseload electricity needed for the power grid – coal, natural gas and nuclear. As I write this, here’s a list of the current generation fuel mix for PJM:

Total Generation – 87,551 megawatts (MW)

• Natural Gas – 33,469 MW (38.22%)

• Nuclear – 28,371 MW (32.41%)

• Coal – 13,197 MW (15.07%)

• Renewable Energy – 10,043 MW (11.47%)

The reason that natural gas is providing so much more power than coal is simple: natural gas is significantly cheaper right now. In August 2025, electricity produced with natural gas priced through the Henry Hub cost $24.11 per MWh (megawatt hour), while electricity produced from Central Appalachian Coal cost $36.37 per MWh – nearly 50% more.

So, what would be the practical effect of running coal plants at 69% when they weren’t required? Even higher electric prices hitting your wallet, taking more of your hard-earned money. Power plants bid into PJM on a continuous basis to provide electricity. The first energy sources called up will be those that are less expensive, and then the more expensive will be utilized as additional capacity is needed. Think of it this way: If you park in the school pick-up line 15 minutes early on a nice day you will probably roll down the windows and turn your car off. You don’t need – or want – to burn gasoline that’s not needed. If the weather is too hot or too cold, you will probably keep your car running to stay comfortable. This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed. If more power is needed, additional generation is called up and more fuel is used. If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.

It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease. Requiring the use of a certain fuel source is picking winners and losers and will add to the cost of generating electricity – ultimately increasing your power bill.

A total of $1.6 million in federal funding was awarded to the school district for the upgrade.
In addition to the vehicles, the school district acquired equipment for five charging stations to power the buses.
They were installed by the county’s Division of Construction Services, which hired skilled union trade workers for the project.
“This fleet of quieter and cleaner buses is a great step in the right direction and a great investment.”","A new fleet of electric-powered buses will soon transport Burlington County Special Services School students.

The county commissioners joined district officials and a state legislator for a ribbon-cutting on Oct. 29 to celebrate the addition of 10 electric buses and five charging stations at the district’s Westampton campus. The upgrade to cleaner, environmentally friendly vehicles is expected to protect the health of students and staff and create long-term savings and benefits.

“We celebrate more than just an addition to our fleet, we celebrate progress, innovation and a shared commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable future for our students and community,” said Special Services/BCIT Superintendent Dr. Ashanti Holley. “This milestone reflects our district’s dedication to both student safety and environmental responsibility.

“These buses represent more than just transportation,” Holley added. “They represent opportunity, clear air for our students, quieter neighborhoods and a forward-thinking approach to how we move our schools and state into the future. Together, we’re going to drive change one mile, one bus and one student at a time.”

The 10 buses are believed to be the largest EV fleet in the county. There are seven, 24-passenger and three 54-passenger vehicles. They will replace about half of the school district’s retiring diesel bus fleet, with the goal of eventually replacing all of them.

The school district purchased the vehicles from Wolfington Body Company using funding secured through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2023 Clean School Bus Rebate Program. Wolfington is based in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania, but has an office in Hainesport.

A total of $1.6 million in federal funding was awarded to the school district for the upgrade.

“The switch from diesel to electric-powered buses is an investment in a cleaner environment and also in our students’ health,” noted county Commissioner Deputy Director Allison Eckel.

In addition to the vehicles, the school district acquired equipment for five charging stations to power the buses. They were installed by the county’s Division of Construction Services, which hired skilled union trade workers for the project.

The division also assisted the school district with the installation of its new all-inclusive playground, and more recently renovated space at the Burlington County Institute of Technology’s Medford campus for a new video game design lab.

“The Division of Construction Services has become one of Burlington County’s biggest successes,” said county Commissioner Randy Brolo. “In 2024 alone, (it) completed more than $17.5 million worth of construction jobs, ranging from roof and elevator repairs to building renovations and bridge replacements.

“This skilled labor has saved county taxpayers millions of dollars on construction expenses, so we were excited to partner with the Special Services School District to use their services for such an important project to improve children’s health and promote a cleaner environment.”

Assemblyman Balvir Singh also congratulated the district on its upgrade.

“As a parent and a public-school educator,” he pointed out, “I can tell you from experience the extraordinary number of hours kids spend on buses, going back and forth to school and on athletic trips or other field trips.

“This fleet of quieter and cleaner buses is a great step in the right direction and a great investment.”",https://media-com.website-us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/image002-2025-10-30T160929.685.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 12:06:56.805889

Around the 2016-2017 timeframe, UNC System President Margaret Spellings and MC Belk Pilon, who is the leader of the John Belk Endowment, had a vision that we needed to close the attainment and skills gap in North Carolina that our employers have identified.

So they brought together a commission of probably

50 different influential leaders across North Carolina. They did listening tours, looked at data and research, and after two years, in 2019, agreed on a state goal. By the year 2030, it was determined that North Carolina was going to need 2 million people between the ages of 25 to 44 to have either an industry-valued credential or a college degree.

So, the N.C. General Assembly codified that goal into state law. And then later that year, myFutureNC stood up as a nonprofit organization to move that goal into action.

Why was it important to reach for the 2 million North Carolinians between age 25 and 44 to have a post-secondary degree or industry-related credential?

We wanted to build a workforce in North Carolina to meet the demands of corporations and employers moving to the state. And also those that currently exist in the state or expanding in the state.

We started in 2019, and then COVID hit. And if anything that elevated the importance of hitting the goal.

How is the group funded?

We are funded by private philanthropy. We got two government grants in the middle of Covid. One came from Covid relief money. And then we were asked by the General Assembly to conduct a study around the opportunities to have interoperable data systems to benefit our students. And those are the only two investments that government has made in the work.

Otherwise, we’re 100% private philanthropy. We’ve got national funders, state funders, local funders. The John M. Belk Endowment was instrumental in this work being lifted off the ground. The Goodnight Educational Foundation is one of our key partners.

How is myFutureNC doing toward its 2 million goal?

We started out with a gap of 400,000 people who were lacking a degree or credential that we needed to close by the year 2030. The most recent census data from last year projected a shortage of about 55,000, so we’ve gone from a gap of 400,000 to a gap of 55,000. We’re closing the gap, thanks to institutions like yours and all of our many education partners across the state.

We’ve got 36 phenomenal private universities, 16 public universities, 58 community colleges and our workforce development boards.

We’ve got the assets, we’ve got the infrastructure, we’ve got some of the very best in the entire nation.

What are the top three assets in North Carolina besides climate and logistical, you know, access to highways and airports?

North Carolina has it all. We’ve got the natural assets, we’ve got the infrastructure, we’ve got the workforce. And at the same time, we know where we’ve got opportunities for growth. So we’ve got a basic foundation for success.

Additionally, North Carolina has a lot of good policies and a lot of good funding streams. For example, we’ve got an entire rural division in the Department of Commerce that has grants that are available to rural parts of the state. We look at it as we are one state, but we have 100 counties and we want to see all 100 thrive.

Since 2019, we’ve had an increased interest in North Carolina economically. Did the increase in companies moving to the state challenge your goals?

The answer is the 2 million by 2030 goal was a factor in the economic growth. So that’s the good news. The goal was set expecting that North Carolina would continue on the trajectory that it was on.

If anything, we are importing talent, but we are both an importer of talent and we’re a producer of talent. The percentage of population growth for our state has been five percentage points over the last five or six years. We love to see North Carolina grow. And, the people that are moving into our state do tend to be more educated than not. So, it actually helps to close the skills gap. We are also growing our own.

What are the specific steps myFutureNC is taking to move toward its goal?

You don’t know where you are and you don’t know how to improve if you don’t know what the data shows. We break it down county by county. And so every county understands how they are actually tracking toward a recommended local goal. But it’s a lot of different key performance indicators, everything from North Carolina pre-K all the way through to labor market alignment.

I will share that 79 of the 100 counties have increased in attainment. We have 21 counties that have not. That factors in population declining or growth.

Is there a correlation between the data looking better in metro areas than rural counties? If so, why?

All 21 counties that are not increasing are rural. As you know, we’ve got rural communities that are resourced very differently than our metro areas.

There are a lot of different things that factor in. Sometimes it’s a matter of people who just don’t know how to navigate the maze of higher education. They don’t think that it’s affordable. They don’t know how to even go about it.

And yet we have 58 community colleges spread all over the state.

That takes me to the next strand of our work, which is things like FAFSA completions, which leads to federal Pell Grants and state need-based grants. And we partner with the state Education Assistance Authority. Our goal is to push the word that college can be affordable.

Or perhaps, they’re virtual options today or even our private colleges have great scholarships. So there’s opportunity. Sometimes it’s a matter of telling the story.

What are some of the challenges keeping you from accomplishing your goals?

We know that there are limited fund buckets for the work that we do. Not for our purposes, but for our partners’ purposes to be able to get some of the work done, it does require some investments from the government. So I would say purse strings is one sometimes.

Politics get in the way in terms of just being able to have a budget, you know, making sure that the state is moving forward. And the third thing is personalities. In this space, different people have different perspectives on how best to go about the work.

But ultimately, everybody has rallied around the North Star of 2 million by 2030.

So 2030 comes, you’ve achieved your goals. What’s next?

We want to make sure that whatever we do is systemic change so that we leave a legacy so that future generations have higher levels of education as well. And so we will not shut down the shop. There may be a 2040 goal that we continue to rally around. We know that North Carolina is going to continue to need a workforce. It may be that we narrow our focus on a particular strand of the work.

We want to make 2 million by 2029 and then keep rolling.

You were the chief of staff in the Department of Commerce from 2015 to 2017, under Secretary John Skvarla. What was the greatest achievement you saw in Commerce in North Carolina?

We came in during the legislation that created the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, which spun off the economic development arm from Commerce. That was a big success. ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/header_power-list-interview_web.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 08:59:10.089785

A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states.
This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed.
If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.
It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease.","Who wants higher electricity rates? Ask just about anyone and they’ll agree that energy prices have risen. They’re not wrong. In recent weeks there has been significant attention in the Mountain State on what is driving those costs. The question has no doubt arisen from people seeing their electricity bills steadily rise, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic five years ago. A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states. For example:

* West Virginia: +27.71%

* Ohio: +30.11%

* Pennsylvania: +30.85%

* Virginia: +19.78%

* Kentucky: +17.66%

* North Carolina: +24.17%

* Texas: +27.58%

Power rates have risen by a quarter or more in five of those states. Virginia has seen slower rate increases due to significant growth in Northern Virginia, and Kentucky’s increases are significantly offset by subsidies from the Tennessee Valley Authority in the western part of the state.

With the backdrop of these prices, some politicians in the West Virginia Legislature have announced plans to introduce legislation that requires coal-fired power plants in West Virginia to at least run at 69% capacity all the time or forego the ability to recoup future costs. The claim is that coal is a cheap fuel source and that such a bill will lower electric rates and put nearly 3,500 coal miners back to work. If it sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is.

Your power company understands the best way to keep your rates as low as possible is to participate in the market. For our region, that market is PJM. PJM is making constant decisions about how to provide the least expensive and most efficient power. One of the key drivers in that decision is what the fuel needed to run the power plant (coal, gas or nuclear) costs. Another is going to be what the power grid needs at any given moment to provide reliable electricity to our state and region.

On a windy day, wind turbines will be called upon to provide a decent share of the power on the grid. If it’s not as windy, that won’t be the case. It’s the same with sunny days and solar farms. The wind and sun don’t charge for their fuel, so instead those electricity costs are largely driven by the hard physical costs (solar panels, windmills) that have already been factored into the capacity market. The intermittent nature of renewable energy, however, means that those energy sources will supplement what is on the grid, but won’t provide the baseload power that is required.

That brings us to the fuel sources that can provide the baseload electricity needed for the power grid – coal, natural gas and nuclear. As I write this, here’s a list of the current generation fuel mix for PJM:

Total Generation – 87,551 megawatts (MW)

* Natural Gas – 33,469 MW (38.22%)

* Nuclear – 28,371 MW (32.41%)

* Coal – 13,197 MW (15.07%)

* Renewable Energy – 10,043 MW (11.47%)

The reason that natural gas is providing so much more power than coal is simple: natural gas is significantly cheaper right now. In August 2025, electricity produced with natural gas priced through the Henry Hub cost $24.11 per MWh (megawatt hour), while electricity produced from Central Appalachian Coal cost $36.37 per MWh – nearly 50% more.

So, what would be the practical effect of running coal plants at 69% when they weren’t required? Even higher electric prices hitting your wallet, taking more of your hard-earned money. Power plants bid into PJM on a continuous basis to provide electricity. The first energy sources called up will be those that are less expensive, and then the more expensive will be utilized as additional capacity is needed. Think of it this way: If you park in the school pick-up line 15 minutes early on a nice day you will probably roll down the windows and turn your car off. You don’t need – or want – to burn gasoline that’s not needed. If the weather is too hot or too cold, you will probably keep your car running to stay comfortable. This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed. If more power is needed, additional generation is called up and more fuel is used. If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.

It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease. Requiring the use of a certain fuel source is picking winners and losers and will add to the cost of generating electricity – ultimately increasing your power bill.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.newsandsentinel.com/images/2024/11/20211138/Image-From-a-Certain-Point-of-View-Op-Ed-1100x638.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 03:18:02.573309

Gov. Greg Abbott earlier this year signed a law authorizing a $1 billion private school voucher program, tapping the state comptroller’s office as the entity responsible for its creation.

The law grants Texas’ chief financial officer tremendous authority to build the infrastructure around education savings accounts, a type of voucher program that will allow families to receive taxpayer money to cover their children’s private school or home-schooling costs.

The agency’s responsibilities include choosing the companies that will receive millions of dollars to help administer the program, creating the rules that participating families must follow and producing annual reports on the program’s outcomes.

Former Texas Sen. Kelly Hancock currently serves as acting comptroller and will guide most of the program’s development before it launches next year. The North Richland Hills Republican filled the position after Glenn Hegar stepped down to lead the Texas A&M University System.

The comptroller is an elected position, and voters will decide next year who will occupy the role for the next four-year term. Hancock is running to keep the seat against Texas Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick and former state Sen. Don Huffines, R-Dallas, the other two candidates in the Republican primary who plan to run for comptroller.

State law provides the comptroller with a framework for how to structure the program, but the office will ultimately determine what exactly it will look like ahead of its official launch at the start of the 2026-27 school year.

Here’s what you need to know about the comptroller’s role in shaping the voucher program.

What does the comptroller do?

The comptroller manages the state’s money and collects taxes, estimates revenue and awards state contracts.

Texas operates a $337 billion budget and rakes in more than $250 billion in revenue from a variety of taxes, fees and assessments.

What is the comptroller’s role in shaping the state’s school voucher program?

The comptroller’s office will oversee the $1 billion program’s implementation. It will negotiate contracts with and select the companies responsible for helping manage the day-to-day operations. Those companies will help the state respond to inquiries, process payments and resolve complaints, among other duties.

The agency will also design the program’s rules. It will work with vendors to determine which private schools can receive state money through the program, when families can apply to participate, what documentation Texans have to submit and how participants will access funds to make approved educational purchases.

The comptroller must hire a private company to audit the program at least once a year to ensure participants, schools and vendors are following state requirements. The agency can close the accounts of students who do not remain in good standing. It must also notify the appropriate county or district attorney in the local jurisdiction of any family, school or company that appears to have committed fraud or broken the law.

State law requires the office to collect and publish annual data on the program, such as the number of applications it receives and accepts, participant satisfaction, and how the program affects private school capacity and Texas’ public education system. The comptroller is required to provide state lawmakers with the demographic information of participants, such as age, race and sex. The finance chief can also ask the Legislature to increase the program’s funding.

What has the comptroller done to build the program so far?

The office released the proposed rules for the program earlier this year. It invited Texans to submit comments on the proposal over a 30-day period that concluded in September and conducted a public hearing soon after.

The comptroller also accepted bids from companies interested in helping manage the program — officially called Texas Education Freedom Accounts — later agreeing to a contract with the New York-based finance and technology company Odyssey.

The state could end up paying Odyssey up to $52 million for its services over the next four years — $26 million for the first two and an additional $26 million for another two if the contract gets renewed. The law allows the state to pay the company up to 5% of the program’s $1 billion in funding, or $50 million, each year.

The agency is expected to launch its marketing campaign for the program around the end of October.

What else needs to happen before the program launches?

The comptroller has yet to open registration for Texas private schools looking to participate in the program, as well as the process for families to apply.

Odyssey and the comptroller agreed to a plan that sets a tentative date of Dec. 2 for private schools to register to become one of the options families can select to spend funds awarded by the state.

The agreement also set Feb. 4, 2026, as the date when Texas will begin accepting applications from families seeking state aid to pay for their children’s private school or home-schooling expenses. That window would remain open until mid-March. Odyssey will design those processes and the system parents will use to pay tuition.

Under the current plan, the state is expected to provide a status update for students it approves by May 1, 2026. State law sets May 15, 2026, as the date the comptroller must finalize the program rules.

The tuition platform families will use is expected to launch in early July.

What do we know about the candidates running for the office?

So far, three candidates are expected to run to be the state’s next comptroller.

Abbott appointed Hancock, a former state senator, as interim comptroller in June. Hancock is vying against Craddick, the Texas Railroad Commissioner, and Huffines, the former state senator, in the Republican primary. No Democrat has publicly expressed interest in the office.

None of the candidates could be reached for interviews before publication. Hancock, who is overseeing the creation of the state’s voucher program, has toured campuses across the state to promote it. In a statement, Craddick said that her top priority for the voucher program as comptroller would be to ensure “every dollar is used exactly as intended.” It is not clear if Huffines has any plans for the voucher program, but he supported its creation when he served in the Legislature.

Three LNG export facilities in Cameron Parish are featured in a report from the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit research organization.

Sourced from federal and state data, the report documents federal Clean Air Act infractions for each of the past 12 quarters – spanning three years – at Cheniere Energy‘s Sabine Pass LNG terminal and Venture Global‘s Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal. The Cameron LNG export terminal in Hackberry has been out of compliance with the Clean Air Act for 11 of the past 12 quarters.

Report author and Environmental Integrity Project research manager Alexandra Shaykevich spoke at a press event about the “terrible compliance record” for the LNG industry, noting that Southwest Louisiana facilities in particular have been in “nearly continuous” violation of the Clean Air Act for the past three years.

Venture Global and Cameron LNG did not respond to requests for comment on the report. Cheniere Energy had no comment.

Cameron Parish resident John Allaire lives within 30 miles of the three LNG facilities highlighted in the report – and six more that are planned or under construction.

“I live in the eye of this LNG hurricane,” Allaire said at a news conference this week announcing the report’s release.

Allaire’s home sits close enough to the Venture Global facility for him to see fiery plumes of methane flares from his patio. The Commonwealth LNG facility is planned 750 feet away from his property line, he said.

“I’m surrounded on all sides,” he said. “It’s not the same coastal wetland estuary that it used to be.”

While each terminal provided varying explanations for its violations, Shaykevich said, common ones include:

failure to report excess emissions and permit deviations to state regulators;

exceeding allowed pollution limits for contaminants such as nitrous oxide, volatile organic compounds and sulphur dioxide; and

failure to properly operate equipment meant to control pollution levels.

Cameron LNG’s Clean Air Act violations included at least 89 instances of excess pollution that released thousands of pounds of benzine, a known carcinogen, from the facility into the surrounding environment, according to the report’s analysis of Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality records.

“We need these companies to actually be good neighbors and not to continue causing suffering in the communities in which they operate,” said James Hiatt, director of local nonprofit For a Better Bayou at the news conference.

Each of the three facilities had only two air enforcement actions opened from LDEQ, according to the report. Cheniere Energy had paid $225,000 in fines as of July 29, when state records were analyzed, for air quality violations. Financial penalties hadn’t yet been finalized for the other two facilities before the Environmental Integrity Project published its report.

The report also included tallies of Clean Water Act violations for LNG terminals in Southwest Louisiana. Sabine Pass was out of compliance with the act’s standards for 8 of the past 12 quarters. Cameron LNG had violations in seven quarters, and Calcasieu had just one quarter with water-related infractions.

Cameron LNG had 27 effluent violations from July 2020 through June 2025. Sabine Pass had nine and Calcasieu Pass recorded one over the same period, according to the report’s analysis. The violations at Cameron LNG and Sabine Pass involved fecal coliform and suspended solids, such as algae, bacteria and industrial particles. The lone issue at Calcalsieu Pass involved only suspended solids.

Shaykevich said the pattern of permit violations for existing facilities should be a factor in approving new facilities as the LNG industry continues its rapid expansion.

“President Trump has aggressively promoted the liquefied natural gas industry, including by directing agencies to fast track certain approvals for LNG projects,” he said. “State and federal agencies should be slowing down and more carefully scrutinizing new applications for LNG export projects instead of speeding up permit reviews.”",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/10/3.-Depositphotos_LNG.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 08:17:31.198763

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,” coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to “keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. The rest was thermal coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, according to Blumenfeld.

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.

Appalachia would therefore benefit most from a resumption of U.S. coal exports to China, noted Blumenfeld by email.

“There is optimism,” Blumenfeld wrote. “But there is little documentation to back that up right now.”

Most coal headed for China last year went through Baltimore, with lesser amounts via the Norfolk, Virginia, area and Gulf of Mexico, according to Blumenfeld.

Relatively little thermal coal from the Western U.S. is exported due to the cost of hauling it by rail to the West Coast, where there has also been political resistance to building port facilities to export more coal.

But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.
Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years.
“Accelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,” he said.
“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said.","Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.

The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.

The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.

“While there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you’re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,"" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.

The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.

Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.

They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest — a 31% share of vehicle sales — to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)

The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.

The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is “not only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,” said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.

Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn’t involved in the research, called it a “valuable study” that echoes other findings and “confirms the environmental and economic benefits” of EVs.

“Accelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,” he said.

Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.

“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said. “So the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.""

Outside experts agreed — as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn't been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.

“The great news is the rest of the world isn’t slowing down in terms of its embrace of this technology,"" said Ellen Kennedy, principal for carbon-free transportation at RMI, a clean energy nonprofit. As for the U.S., she said, ""I think it’s important to keep in mind states and local governments, there’s a lot that’s happening on those fronts.”

One thing the study didn't address was recycling or disposal of batteries at the end of their life. Kennedy said battery recycling will improve, helping to address one of the environmental impacts of their production.

The study comes at a notable time given the challenges that EVs face in the U.S.

EVs have seen more interest in recent years as an alternative to gas-powered cars and trucks — particularly as they become more affordable and charging infrastructure becomes more available.

But growth has slowed amid shifting federal policy toward EVs and an industry step back from ambitious EV production promises.

Former President Joe Biden set a target for 50% of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030. But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.

“The study is important to show how really misguided the current administration’s policies are,” Shindell said. “If we want to protect us from climate change and from the very clear and local damage from poor air quality, this is a really clear way to do it: Incentivize the switch from internal combustion engines to EVs.”

The German automaker announced Friday it will use the financing to offer hybrid versions of all new vehicles developed and manufactured in the region starting in 2026.

The move marks the latest step in Volkswagen’s retreat from its once-aggressive pure electric vehicle strategy, as the company hedges its electrification bets amid slowing global EV demand and intensifying competition from Chinese manufacturers.

Comprehensive Hybrid Rollout Planned for 2026

“We will offer hybrids in every possible category: mild hybrids, hybrids, and plug-in hybrids,” said Ciro Possobom, Volkswagen’s head in Brazil.

The automaker expects to invest 20 billion reais ($3.7 billion) in South America by 2028, building on a previous commitment of €1 billion announced in 2023.

The BNDES financing will support development of flex-fuel hybrid vehicles that can run on either gasoline or ethanol, capitalizing on Brazil’s extensive biofuel infrastructure. Ethanol derived from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to gasoline, making it an attractive bridge technology for markets where pure EV infrastructure remains limited.

According to Argus Media, every vehicle developed and manufactured by Volkswagen in South America will be electrified “at some capacity” as soon as 2026. The funding will also help develop advanced driver-assistance systems and infotainment technologies—features that have become standard in Chinese EVs rapidly gaining popularity in Brazil.

Strategic Pivot Mirrors Global Retreat From Pure EVs

Volkswagen’s Brazil strategy reflects a broader global shift away from the “EV-or-bust” approach championed by former CEO Herbert Diess. Under current CEO Oliver Blume, the automaker has systematically walked back ambitious battery-electric commitments while increasing investment in hybrid technologies.

The company’s ID family of electric vehicles, once positioned as central to VW’s future, has struggled to gain traction against cheaper Chinese competitors and persistent consumer concerns about charging infrastructure, range anxiety, and high purchase prices. In fact, the automaker is selling so many combustion engine vehicles that it’s on track to overshoot European emissions allowances, prompting Blume to ask EU regulators for leniency.

This represents a dramatic reversal from just three years ago, when Volkswagen aggressively lobbied for strict EV mandates in the European Union.

“Electric mobility has won the race,” Diess declared in 2021 when presenting VW’s battery strategy. “Many in the industry questioned our approach. Today, they are following suit, while we are reaping the fruit.”

Those fruits have proven less plentiful than anticipated.

Why Brazil Matters for US EV Enthusiasts

While this announcement focuses on South American markets, the strategic implications extend directly to US consumers and the global automotive industry. Volkswagen’s hybrid pivot in Brazil mirrors identical consumer preference shifts happening in the United States.

Recent data shows American interest in pure electric vehicles declining sharply. An AAA survey found only 16% of Americans would consider an EV as their next vehicle—down from 25% just two years ago in 2023. Meanwhile, 45% say they would consider purchasing a hybrid, according to Pew Research Center.

Battery electric vehicle transaction prices in the US averaged $59,200 in March 2025, compared to $47,500 for all new vehicles—a 25% premium that represents the highest price gap since April 2023, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That price differential, combined with range anxiety and charging infrastructure concerns, has driven consumers toward hybrid alternatives that offer electrification benefits without the infrastructure dependencies.

The September 2025 expiration of federal EV tax credits has further complicated the market dynamics, creating uncertainty that benefits hybrid vehicles as a lower-risk alternative for consumers hesitant about full electrification.

BNDES: Brazil’s Green Financing Powerhouse

The Brazilian National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) ranks as one of the world’s largest development banks, with total assets exceeding $216 billion. Established in 1952, BNDES has played a fundamental role in financing industrial expansion and infrastructure development across Brazil.

The bank operates with an explicit commitment to sustainable development and climate change mitigation, having assisted Brazil in constructing one of the planet’s cleanest energy grids. BNDES prioritizes projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions while generating employment and reducing regional inequalities.

For Volkswagen, accessing BNDES financing provides favorable long-term credit terms while aligning the project with Brazil’s national development priorities and Paris Agreement commitments to reduce emissions.

South America: VW’s Strategic Growth Market

Brazil represents Volkswagen’s largest market in South America and has been profitable for the company since 2021 after years of losses. The automaker operates four plants in Brazil—in São Bernardo do Campo, Taubaté, São José dos Pinhais, and an engine plant in São Carlos—plus a parts center and 473 dealerships covering all Brazilian states.

Volkswagen began production in Brazil 70 years ago in São Paulo, making it the company’s first manufacturing location outside Germany. The automaker has produced 25 million vehicles in Brazil over seven decades, with 4 million exported to other markets.

The South American automotive market is expected to grow 11% annually until 2030, making it one of the fastest-growing markets globally. However, pure EV adoption in Brazil is projected to remain modest—around 4% of new vehicle sales by 2033—making hybrid technology a more practical electrification pathway for the region.

EVXL’s Take

Volkswagen’s $426 million BNDES financing for hybrid development isn’t an isolated decision—it’s the culmination of 18 months of strategic retreat from pure electric vehicles that EVXL has documented extensively.

In June 2025, we reported that VW was delaying its all-new Scalable Systems Platform (SSP) and integrating range-extending gas engines, abandoning the clean-sheet EV architecture originally planned. Just weeks earlier in May 2025, shareholders demanded governance reforms, criticizing the company’s board for lacking expertise in electrification and digitalization—expertise desperately needed as VW falls behind competitors like Tesla and BYD.

The pattern continued throughout 2024. In September, we covered how VW was contemplating factory closures in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history, squeezed between high European production costs and aggressive Chinese EV manufacturers capturing market share. August brought news that VW’s battery chief was backing away from the target of 200 gigawatt hours of battery capacity by 2030, emphasizing “flexibility” over the company’s previous aggressive stance.

This Brazil announcement crystallizes what we’ve been tracking: Volkswagen is formalizing its hybrid-first strategy globally, not just in developing markets. While Tesla CEO Elon Musk maintains that automakers pursuing plug-in hybrids over pure EVs are making a strategic mistake, legacy manufacturers like VW have calculated differently. They’re watching US consumers demonstrate the same preferences Brazilian buyers show—45% willing to consider hybrids versus just 16% for pure EVs, according to recent surveys.

The timing is particularly telling. With US federal EV tax credits expiring in September 2025, American automakers including GM and Ford are pivoting toward hybrids to meet consumer demand without forcing expensive pure-EV technology into segments where buyers remain hesitant. VW’s Brazil strategy—leveraging existing fuel infrastructure while adding electrification—provides a blueprint for this hedged approach globally.

Brazil’s flex-fuel expertise offers VW something it desperately needs: a way to claim environmental progress (80% emissions reduction with ethanol versus gasoline) without the massive infrastructure investments and consumer education required for pure EV adoption. It’s pragmatic, cost-effective, and perfectly aligned with current market realities.

But here’s what concerns us: this represents the formalization of defeat for the bold electric vision Herbert Diess championed just four years ago. When Diess declared “electric mobility has won the race” in 2021, he envisioned VW as the global EV leader by 2025. Instead, under Oliver Blume’s leadership, VW has become a case study in strategic retreat—asking regulators for emissions leniency, closing historic factories, and now cementing hybrids as the primary electrification path for the world’s fastest-growing automotive markets.

The Chinese automakers VW once dismissed are now forcing everyone else to play catch-up. BYD alone sold 2.5 million hybrids in 2024, leveraging local battery plants that enable 30% cost advantages over European manufacturers. While VW secures loans for hybrid development, Chinese competitors are already exporting both pure EVs and plug-in hybrids at scale, capturing market share across Latin America, Europe, and beyond.

For EV enthusiasts in the US, Volkswagen’s Brazil move signals that the “inevitable” pure-EV future may be further away than optimistic projections suggested. Legacy automakers are choosing the path of least resistance—hybrids that require no new infrastructure, address range anxiety, and meet emissions targets at lower cost than pure battery-electric platforms.

The revolution is still coming. It’s just moving slower than promised, and taking a more circuitous route.

Conclusion AFIDA enforcement, once largely perfunctory, is becoming a meaningful compliance risk for the energy and infrastructure sectors.","The renewed focus by the Trump Administration and Congress on enforcement of the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 (AFIDA) marks a significant shift for foreign-owned developers of energy and infrastructure projects. Since its enactment, few enforcement penalties were imposed under AFIDA. Now, with increasing scrutiny on foreign investment in agricultural land as a national security issue—and amid several recent Congressional proposals to expand oversight and tighten reporting requirements—AFIDA has re-emerged as a compliance risk for energy projects, particularly with increased reliance on foreign capital in the industry.

This renewed enforcement environment raises several legal, transactional, and compliance considerations for project sponsors, investors, and counsel.

Overview: AFIDA and Its Reach

AFIDA was enacted for the collection of information regarding foreign ownership of U.S. agricultural land. Under AFIDA and its authorizing regulations, entities with at least 10% direct or indirect foreign ownership must report certain acquisitions, dispositions, and changes in use of U.S. agricultural land to the Farm Service Agency within the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA). “Agricultural land” is defined broadly to include parcels used for farming, ranching, orchard, vineyard or timber production within the previous five years—categories that often capture sites being repurposed for energy and infrastructure development.

While AFIDA does not prohibit foreign ownership, it does impose mandatory reporting obligations and authorizes significant civil penalties for failure to file or for submitting false or incomplete information—potentially up to 25% of the property’s fair market value.

Importantly, AFIDA applies not only to direct fee ownership of land but also to leasehold interests of 10 years or longer. Easement interests and contingent future interests (including options) are expressly excluded.

Energy and infrastructure projects with long-term site rights often fall under the purview of AFIDA, particularly during the construction and operation periods, creating a reporting obligation that is easily overlooked.

Many states also impose reporting and ownership restrictions on foreign-owned agricultural land that can vary widely from those under AFIDA.

AFIDA Enforcement

The USDA is tasked with collecting, tracking and reporting data under AFIDA, as well as assessing civil penalties up to 25% of the fair market value of the property for non-compliance.

While AFIDA has existed for nearly five decades, enforcement activity has historically been limited due largely to funding and staffing constraints at USDA. In recent years, however, foreign ownership of interests in U.S. agricultural land has exploded—with approximately 45 million acres of U.S. agricultural land held by foreign entities as of December 2023—with calls for renewed regulatory scrutiny. Recent penalty assessment data underscores this trend:

Many recent enforcement actions have targeted renewable and other energy and infrastructure projects, reflecting both the scale of their landholdings and the increasing presence of foreign capital in energy infrastructure investment. Further, with the increased awareness of AFIDA, several legislative and regulatory proposals have been advanced in recent years that would affect its scope and operation, including more than three bills introduced in the current Congress largely aimed at increasing reporting requirements and strengthening enforcement.

Accordingly, compliance with AFIDA and other state restrictions should be considered when acquiring, leasing, or developing land with any level of foreign ownership or investment participation. Project participants should anticipate enhanced data collection, more frequent audits, and higher penalty assessments in the years ahead and stay updated on legislative and regulatory developments in this area insofar as any changes are likely to impact compliance requirements.

Conclusion

AFIDA enforcement, once largely perfunctory, is becoming a meaningful compliance risk for the energy and infrastructure sectors. With foreign investment continuing to play a critical role in project development and financing, project participants cannot afford to treat AFIDA as an afterthought.

Instead, investors and developers should identify potential AFIDA triggers early in site acquisition, leasing, and financing stages; incorporate compliance representations and covenants into transaction documents; and prepare for heightened scrutiny from the USDA, Congress, and state regulators—all of whom increasingly view agricultural and rural land use through a national security lens. And with multiple recent Congressional proposals to further expand oversight and tighten reporting requirements, participants must remain vigilant and up to date on legislative developments to ensure continued compliance in a rapidly evolving compliance landscape.","https://images.passle.net/fit-in/400x400/filters:crop(0,46,1998,1125)/Passle/671960b986748a978b266239/SearchServiceImages/2025-10-31-13-51-13-975-6904bed1f20ebfb6312f8ae6.jpg",N,,2025-11-01 07:58:53.459191

Finalizing the 2026–2027 RVOs quickly will give our industry the certainty it needs to keep investing in those goals.”","Today the National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) submitted comments to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the supplemental 2026–2027 Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) rulemaking.

In a break from tradition, NOPA submitted a single-page comment, a deliberate choice to emphasize that the time for further deliberation has passed and that swift action is urgently needed to provide market certainty for America’s farmers, oilseed processors, and renewable fuel producers.

“Our message to EPA is simple: finalize the rule now,” said Devin Mogler, President and CEO of NOPA. “Every day of delay adds more uncertainty for farmers and processors – the EPA has already done an excellent job with a proposal that includes BBD volumes reflective of the industry’s capacity and a half-RIN provision that prioritizes domestic feedstocks.”

NOPA’s comments reinforce key priorities for the supplemental and final rule:

· Strong Biomass-Based Diesel (BBD) volumes that reflect actual growth and industry capacity

· 100% reallocation of waived gallons to maintain the integrity of the RFS, and

· Support for the half-RIN mechanism, which prioritizes U.S. feedstocks and safeguards domestic agriculture from unfair foreign competition

“This is a critical moment for America’s biofuel and oilseed industries,” Mogler added. “The RFS was designed to strengthen rural economies, improve energy security, and promote homegrown innovation. Finalizing the 2026–2027 RVOs quickly will give our industry the certainty it needs to keep investing in those goals.”",,N,,2025-11-01 06:01:57.598901

It’s maddening, because for a second it’s been about soybeans to distract us from Epstein. All we get are TACO threats.

U.S. imports of edible cooking oil from China are relatively small compared to imports of used cooking oil (UCO), which is actually the byproduct of cooking oil and is used as a raw material for fuels, animal feeds, and chemical products like machine lubricants and certain soaps.

Chinese UCO importssurged in recent years after President Joe Biden’s Administration prioritized a green transition through the landmark Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, That included offering tax credits and other incentives for the use of sustainable aviation fuel by the transportation industry.

The U.S. went from being a net exporter of UCO to becoming a net importer in 2022, and China has accounted for a significant amount of those imports. In 2023, China became the top supplier of UCO to the U.S. That coincided with a drop in demand for Chinese UCO after the European Union probed Chinese imports for artificially low prices. Chinese sales to the U.S. of processed edible oils, including UCO, hit a record 1.27 million tons, worth around $1.2 billion based on recent trade estimates, in 2024. That accounted for around 43% of Chinese UCO exports last year, according to the Department of Agriculture.

China bought 27 million metric tons of soybeans from US farmers in 2024. But somehow this “deal” to buy significantly less is a huge victory.

This above posting is the current state of politics that almost caused a tariff war over cooking oil. The upshot is that Trump thinks tariff wars are like actual wars and that they can be ‘won’. In the latest soybean skirmish Trump gained no advantage, drove up the costs because he screwed up as in his first term and gave his cronies an advantage as he interfered in the market with both Brazil and Argentina, in one case a pro-Bolsonaro tariff and in the other, propping up Milei by bailing out a buddy of Scott Bessent.

Trump didn’t have to threaten a tariff war over cooking oil but he did try. Chinese soybean importers havenot bought any soybeansfrom the latest U.S. harvest in retaliation for earlier U.S. tariffs, costing U.S. farmers (many of whom are Trump supporters) billions of dollars in lost sales.

Trump screwed with his MAGAs for a second time, and still doesn’t know how tariffs work. Now there’s an agreement as of this week, which mollifies US farmers but doesn’t account for the more complex nature of “cooking oil” markets, especially the used cooking oil / UCO market.

India is the world’s biggest importer of cooking oils. Trump is playing the cushion in terms of India’s market but is actually at the mercy of a market for Big Grease (cooking oil) that is not identical to a Used Cooking Oil :

With that cooking oil rant it's quite obvious to any kindergartener he doesn't know how tariffs work and he evidently doesn't know how he put tariffs in place. Used cooking oil is something else, as Trump simply wanted to mess with Biden policies meant to promote biofuels.

Overview of International Trade and Tariffs on Cooking Oil

The topic of international trade often features tariffs as key instruments that governments use to control the flow of imports and exports. A tariff is essentially a tax imposed on imports, making foreign products more expensive compared to local goods. This can lead to trade disputes, commonly referred to as ""tariff wars.""

Current Context of Cooking Oil Tariffs

In recent years, several countries have engaged in tariff disputes concerning cooking oils, particularly palm oil, soybean oil, and canola oil. These disputes typically arise due to various factors:

Market Protection: Countries often impose tariffs to protect their domestic agriculture sectors from foreign competition.

Environmental Concerns: Palm oil production, for example, raises significant environmental issues, prompting some nations to impose tariffs or trade restrictions on suppliers they view as unsustainable.

Political Relations: Tariff wars can also reflect broader geopolitical tensions, where countries use trade policies to exert pressure on each other.

Effects of Tariff Wars

Tariff wars have various consequences that can significantly affect both economies and consumers:

Higher Prices: Consumers typically face higher prices for cooking oils when tariffs are imposed, as import costs increase.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can lead to disruptions in global supply chains, affecting production in related industries.

Retaliatory Measures: Countries often respond to tariffs with their own, leading to an escalation of trade barriers that can harm businesses on both sides.

Recent Examples

For instance, countries in Southeast Asia and Europe have encountered disputes over palm oil, with major producers like Indonesia and Malaysia facing tariffs from the European Union. These tariffs are often justified by the EU's environmental policies, which seek to limit imports that contribute to deforestation.

Other nations might impose tariffs on soybean oil, targeting major producers such as the United States to protect their local market.

As focused as they are on personal profit, one gets the impression that nobody in the Trump administration actually cares about the US economy.

what is to be eaten?

The price of cooking oil was expected to jump up in 2025 thanks to tariffs. Generally, vegetable, canola, soy, coconut, and avocado oils went up. Olive oil has managed to buck this trend for now. While 15% tariffs on goods from the EU will start affecting the product soon, the 2024/2025 bumper olive crop has brought down prices.

Does this mean we’re in the clear? It’s unsure. Tariffs only recently went into effect, and the prices of Kirkland’s olive oils appear to have moved again by September of 2025. The 2-liter Organic Extra Virgin is now up to $20.99, while the 3-liter bottle dropped even more to $22.49 (although we find this Kirkland Signature Olive Oil to be rather bland). Perhaps Costco’s ability to source from different regions has helped them avoid tariffs in the blend.

The initiative focuses on giving high-voltage lithium-ion batteries from BMW and Mini EVs a second life or a responsible end once they can no longer power vehicles.

The partnership builds on EcoBatt’s growing prominence in Australia’s recycling sector, coming just weeks after the company opened the world’s first battery-in-device shredding (BIDS) facility in Campbellfield, Victoria.

How Is BMW Tackling EV Battery Concerns in Australia?

The move addresses one of the key questions facing EV adoption — what happens to batteries when they reach the end of their life or are damaged. BMW’s program ensures these batteries are handled safely and locally, reducing environmental risks and dependence on overseas processing.

Here’s how the recycling loop works:

• Collection: End-of-life or damaged EV batteries are transported from BMW and Mini dealerships to EcoBatt’s Campbellfield plant.

• Safe discharge: Batteries are safely de-energised, and recovered energy is reused to power the facility itself.

• Shredding process: The batteries are mechanically shredded using the BIDS technology.

• Material recovery: The process produces black mass, a mix of valuable materials like lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite.

• Recycling for reuse: This black mass is sent to refiners who extract the minerals for reuse in new battery production.

This full-circle process not only reduces waste but also creates a sustainable materials supply chain for Australia’s growing EV industry.

EcoBatt’s Groundbreaking BIDS Facility

EcoBatt’s Campbellfield facility represents a major leap in local battery recycling. Opened less than two months ago, it’s the first plant in the world capable of safely shredding batteries still embedded in everyday products such as vapes, phones, power tools, and now EV packs.

According to Doug Rowe, CEO of the EcoCycle Group (EcoBatt’s parent company):

“Every home has products with hidden batteries, and until now there hasn’t been a dedicated way to recover them at scale. This plant gives Australians confidence that recycling happens safely, onshore, and responsibly.”

The plant’s capacity highlights its potential impact

• Can process up to 5,000 tonnes of batteries per year

• Recovers over 90 per cent of materials including metals and plastics

• Powers part of its operations with energy recovered from discharged EV batteries

This integration of recycling and self-sustainability reduces emissions and reinforces Australia’s role in the global clean energy supply chain.

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,” coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to “keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. The rest was thermal coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, according to Blumenfeld.

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.

Appalachia would therefore benefit most from a resumption of U.S. coal exports to China, noted Blumenfeld by email.

“There is optimism,” Blumenfeld wrote. “But there is little documentation to back that up right now.”

Most coal headed for China last year went through Baltimore, with lesser amounts via the Norfolk, Virginia, area and Gulf of Mexico, according to Blumenfeld.

Relatively little thermal coal from the Western U.S. is exported due to the cost of hauling it by rail to the West Coast, where there has also been political resistance to building port facilities to export more coal.",https://www.localsyr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2025/10/69053e273b2068.23242105.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-01 13:59:37.875973

Meanwhile, WVR said in a news release that the federal loan “supports WVR’s $2.6 billion clean ammonia fertilizer project, which will repurpose an existing clean-coal gasification plant for ammonia production,” Wabash Valley Resources stated in a news release.
Dan Williams, Wabash Valley Resources chief executive officer, stated, “This project is more than an investment; it’s a new chapter for a worldclass facility and the community that built it.
Not everyone’s thrilled Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources has long raised concerns about the company’s plans for carbon sequestration.
“Vermillion and Vigo County communities, both directly targeted by the Wabash Valley Resources Pilot Project, are standing united together against this unwanted, unnecessary project,” the statement said.","Wabash Valley Resources has secured a $1.5 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy to help finance a coal and ammonia fertilizer facility in West Terre Haute, the federal agency announced Thursday.

The DOE Loan Programs Office “closed a loan to support independent, American-made, and coal-powered fertilizer production,” according to a DOEnews release.

Greg Zoeller, WVR vice president for external affairs, stated, “This project fulfills the long-sought goal of having our first fertilizer plant in Indiana for corn farmers while creating jobs and opportunities for the Wabash Valley by reutilizing a former coal power plant.”

The federal loan “triggers the use of all the private equity we already have,” Zoeller said. The project must use all of those private and investor funds before WVR can use any of the federal loan money.

“With this loan, all of our other financing is fully committed,” he said. “It allows us to start to sign contracts to build an ammonia plant, which will take us a couple of years.” Among those disappointed by the news was Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, which has long raised concerns about the project’s carbon sequestration component.

“This is extremely disheartening news. The health and safety of the community is at risk and taxpayer dollars will be squandered on outdated and dirty 20th century technology for what will likely be a massive boondoggle,” Olson said.

Wabash Valley Resources has previously said it plans to pipe and inject 1.67 million tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface as part of its plan to produce anhydrous ammonia fertilizer at the former coal gasification plant. Zoeller said WVR has the authority to construct the CO2 wells, but to inject CO2 it will have to go through another process. Injection would be among the last things to occur in the project. “We have to make ammonia before we inject anything,” Zoeller said. The federal loan would be repaid through the project, with a lot of it coming from carbon capture, Zoeller said.

Meanwhile, WVR said in a news release that the federal loan “supports WVR’s $2.6 billion clean ammonia fertilizer project, which will repurpose an existing clean-coal gasification plant for ammonia production,” Wabash Valley Resources stated in a news release.

According to DOE, the project will restart and repurpose a coal gasification plant idled since 2016 to produce 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia per year by using coal from a nearby southern Indiana mine and petcoke as feedstock.

Dan Williams, Wabash Valley Resources chief executive officer, stated, “This project is more than an investment; it’s a new chapter for a worldclass facility and the community that built it. With the support of the U.S. Department of Energy, our elected leaders, our Korean partners, and America’s skilled workforce, we’re restoring good-paying jobs and proving that rural Indiana can help lead America’s clean energy future.

Williams added, “We’re especially grateful to the men and women of organized labor — particularly the national IBEW and our local building trades unions — whose skill and professionalism will bring this vision to life.”

The Wabash project will bring the gasification plant back online to produce ammonia fertilizer – a vital resource for farmers across the Corn Belt, which currently relies on imports from Canada, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Russia, the DOE release stated.

This marks the second closed loan under the Energy Dominance Financing Program created by the Working Families Tax Cut, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Not everyone’s thrilled

Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources has long raised concerns about the company’s plans for carbon sequestration.

Opponents say carbon capture is not a proven technology, and risks include potential water and soil contamination; human health and safety risks; seismic activity; and pipeline ruptures.

Other concerns relate to emergency response, safety and evacuation, the group says.

Olson, of Citizens Action Coalition, said “it is extremely telling and disingenuous that the [Department of Energy] press release fails to mention the CCS component of this project. Not surprising however considering this Administration has repealed the endangerment finding and is denying climate change.""

Olson continued, “Therefore, they are hiding the fact that this project is taking advantage of the CCS tax credits included in President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which was designed in part, to address the climate crisis. So, if there’s no climate crisis, why is the Trump Administration supporting this project? Makes no sense.”

In an emailed statement, Whitney Boyce of Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources said, “It is shameful that this administration would hand out $1.5 billion to a privately owned, Korean-backed corporation during a shutdown when everyday people can’t receive basic government services and government employees go unpaid.

“Vermillion and Vigo County communities, both directly targeted by the Wabash Valley Resources Pilot Project, are standing united together against this unwanted, unnecessary project,” the statement said.

Boyce continued, “Indiana law states WVR must have 60% voluntary pore space before eminent domain can be used to take our property against our will. This company and its foreign partners will be hard pressed to ever have majority support in our community for their CO2 dumps. We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting Hoosier land and lives from this dangerous scheme. It is our land, not theirs.”",,N,,2025-10-31 20:06:17.872315

The state ranks ninth nationally in the number of data centers, with 91.
In 2023, data centers consumed 4% of U.S. electricity generation, and that may double by 2030, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.
“Hyperscale data centers actually don’t employ many staff — typically in the 50 to 150 range,” says Synergy Research Group’s Dinsdale.
“There are always going to be examples of data center developers getting it wrong in terms of scale, timing, demand or logistics, but the overriding picture is one of there not being enough data center capacity,” says Dinsdale from Synergy Research.","Amazon, Apple, Google, OpenAI affiliate Stargate. Everybody is building a data center these days. Data center construction represents one of the largest building projects in world history.

It is certainly one of the most expensive. “Total investment in upcoming and under construction data centers has soared to around $750 billion,” estimates Alex Wang, an analyst at Nashville, Tennessee-based investment firm Alliance Bernstein. That seems understated, with Stargate alone committed to spending $500 billion for AI-related data center projects over the next four years.

In North Carolina, Amazon says it will spend $10 billion for data centers in Richmond County as part of a broader $100 billion plan over 15 years. Apple is planning a $175 million investment at its data center in Maiden in Catawba County. Major projects are underway or being considered in several other NC cities.

As a result, Duke Energy projects energy demand in North Carolina will grow eight times faster over the next 15 years than in the previous 15. Artificial intelligence requires computing that demands massive energy inputs.

Data center investment is having a measurable impact on the country’s overall economic growth. Information processing investment contributed more than half of the 1.2% growth in U.S. GDP during the first half of 2025, according to The Wall Street Journal. UBS, an investment bank, forecasts that companies will spend $375 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 and another $500 billion next year.

It’s a big number, and North Carolina is hoping to get its fair share, or maybe a little bit more. The state ranks ninth nationally in the number of data centers, with 91. Virginia leads with more than 600, followed by Texas (379) and California (318).

In terms of megawatts of electricity consumed by data centers, Texas leads the way with about 8,000 MW, followed by Virginia with 7,000, according to CarbonCredits.com, which tracks carbon usage. In North Carolina, the comparable figure is around 770 megawatts, reports the Baxtel research group. In 2023, data centers consumed 4% of U.S. electricity generation, and that may double by 2030, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

Data centers are also getting bigger, with many defined as “hyperscale,” a term that IBM characterizes as a physical site large enough for at least 5,000 servers and possibly miles of connection equipment. These centers can “easily encompass millions of square feet of space,” IBM says.

THE NEXT LOUDON COUNTY

In the old days, pioneers followed rivers and streams to open up new territory, and cities were founded along their banks. More recently, railroads and the interstate highway system have helped drive site selection for corporations and distribution centers. Now, for data centers, it’s power availability.

In discussing how to assess a potential data center site, site selection expert Ben Rojahn says he looks for high-voltage transmission lines first, followed by fiber capacity and “some reasonable access to water and sewer.” He’s a vice president for data center solutions with the CBRE real estate firm in Charlotte.

Loudon County, Virginia, which is directly west of Washington, D.C., has perhaps the world’s greatest concentration of data centers. Statewide, they consumed a whopping 23.6% of the Dominion State’s electricity in 2023, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. For North Carolina, the comparable number was 1.9%.

Partly as a result, data center development is on the move. “The whole I-85 corridor is seeing a lot of activity from data center developers and users,” says CBRE’s Rojahn, moving down from Virginia and, to a lesser extent, up from Atlanta.

North Carolina appears well positioned to capture some of that growth. The state is poised to meet demands for larger power loads over the next four or five years, Rojahn says, making it competitive with other states. It has regions served by high-voltage lines built originally for furniture and textile companies and other manufacturers that can be put to work bringing power to data centers. While those lines may serve smaller markets rather than large metros, that is not an issue with some AI and cloud applications where latency — the time it takes data to move from where it’s sourced to the destination – is less of a concern.

With billions of dollars at stake, states are competing aggressively to be the next Loudon County. Incentives often include a combination of sales and use tax exemptions, property tax abatements, investment tax credits, and regulatory relief like relaxed zoning requirements. Favorable power rates are also sometimes involved.

“Our job is to work with local leaders and economic development officials to help power their economy in a manner that matches their local vision for the community,” says Danielle Buckins, Duke Energy’s director of North Carolina development.

The benefits are clear, the costs perhaps less so. Consider the potential impact on Richmond County, where median income was $46,600 in 2023, compared with about $69,000 statewide. The county’s value of assessed property stands at $4.4 billion, which is less than Amazon’s proposed long-term investment. As many as 1,500 construction workers are expected to participate over the next five years.

Amazon has promised to create 500 permanent jobs, but hasn’t estimated the expected average salaries. The county offered a 20-year incentive package of cash grants equal to 50% of the annual property tax and 65% of the annual personal property tax for each of the 20 buildings that are proposed for the project. The package is contingent on $1 billion of investments and 50 jobs by the end of 2030.

“Five hundred jobs is huge for Richmond County,” says Martie Butler, a county economic developer. “A lot of years of planning went into developing our infrastructure (to attract a company like Amazon),” including support for Duke Energy’s generating facility near Hamlet, she says. “It will enhance our tax base significantly, and it won’t be a heavy lift for our community.”

A FOOL’S RACE?

In site selection, “The gating issues are ones that drive material cost impact — the availability of power, the availability of fiber,” says Jim Grice, a partner in Dallas at the Akerman law firm and a specialist in data centers and digital infrastructure. “Beyond that, one of the other big inputs to costs is taxes. The data center asset class operates with a very high percent of assets that are personal property. Servers have a refresh cycle. They last three to five years. As a result, your tax framework will have a big impact on site selection.”

Not everyone thinks these incentives are a good idea. North Carolina’s lack of transparency around data center incentives suggests that the state is “hiding costs and exaggerating benefits,” thereby putting the state’s budget at risk, according to a September op-ed in the News & Observer of Raleigh penned by Goodjobsfirst executive director Greg LeRoy and Brian Balfour of the Locke Foundation. Both nonprofits oppose corporate subsidies.

“It’s a fool’s race to the bottom,” LeRoy says in an interview. “This is not a struggling industry. These are enormously profitable and valuable companies doing something that makes a ton of profit for them.”

The companies would build these data centers with or without tax subsidies and abatements, he says. Citing the loss of tax revenues and the potential strain on local infrastructure like schools and roads, “I think North Carolina would win by losing data centers.”

Some residents of potential sites for data centers share that view. Opposition to projects has blocked projects in various N.C. locations, including some economically struggling ones. In September, Tarboro voted to reject a proposal to build a $6.4 billion data center project in Edgecombe County, citing concerns over its impact on water, sewer, and quality of life issues. The county’s 6.1% unemployment rate in September was the state’s highest.

Akerman’s Grice offers a more positive view of the impact of giant server farms. “You have substantial upgrades (to infrastructure) that wouldn’t be done except for the data center. Typically, [the data centers] pay a higher than regional average salary. The investment is so material they’re not going to walk away overnight. They’ll stimulate the local economy. They don’t have smokestacks. They don’t have as much impact as a new manufacturing facility would. They tend to have a clustering

effect — other companies show up.”

The data center industry contends there is a significant multiplier effect of as much as $7 of economic activity for every dollar invested. Good, bad, or indifferent, the tax incentive ship seems to have sailed among political and economic development leaders. As Rojahn puts it, “Tax incentives are a prerequisite for states to be competitive.”

Critics note other issues, most prominently the lack of significant long-term employment opportunities at data centers once they’re up and running, and the potential impact on ratepayers from all this demand for electricity.

“Hyperscale data centers actually don’t employ many staff — typically in the 50 to 150 range,” says Synergy Research Group’s Dinsdale. “For reasons of efficiency, security and cost, there is a lot of software and automation, rather than staff. The big employee numbers are in the construction phase, when there might easily be a thousand workers or many more.”

As for consumers, they are starting to notice the impact of all this construction on their electric bills. A recent study from Carnegie-Mellon and NC State universities reported that “data center and cryptocurrency mining growth through 2030 could increase average U.S. electricity costs by 8%” though the impact will vary by region and the sources of power generation. A Bloomberg analysis in September found that “electricity now costs as much as 267% more for a single month than it did five years ago in areas located near significant data center activity.”

One thing for sure is it will increase demand. Duke has more than 100 prospective customer projects of all types in the Carolinas with a base demand of 50 megawatts or greater. Historically, Duke says, 10 megawatts was considered a large load.

Dot-com reprise?

In tech land, any trend that persists over a multiyear period is almost inevitably deemed a “bubble.” AI and data centers are now entering that territory, prompting comparisons with the dot-com bubble in 1999-2001 that ended with the NASDAQ index crashing nearly 80% from its peak. Key differences are that the Internet was early in its adoption curve 25 years ago, while today’s AI data centers are being financed by massive companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta. There may be an excess of capital going into the sector, but the businesses are real.

Of course, AI could change everything and still leave behind hundreds of billions of dollars in stranded capital, which occurred during the early Internet era. San Jose, California-based Cisco Systems is a leading networking equipment operator, and operates a large site in Durham. It had the stock market’s largest valuation in March 2000, briefly topping $80 per share. It lost more than 80% of its value by late 2002. Twenty-three years later, it has rebounded to the $70 range.

Many following the tech industry remain resolutely bullish. “I don’t sense that we’re going to see a slowdown in the immediate future,” says Akerman’s Grice. “You have cloud [computing] growing at 18% compounded annually, and AI cloud is projected to grow

at 36%.”

The next big step in AI is expected to be “inference,” which refers to how technology is deployed once the robotic models have been completely trained.

“There are always going to be examples of data center developers getting it wrong in terms of scale, timing, demand or logistics, but the overriding picture is one of there not being enough data center capacity,” says Dinsdale from Synergy Research.

In August, Open AI CEO Sam Altman told a group of reporters, “When bubbles happen, s

mart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes.”

Venture capitalists put $192.7 billion into AI startups this year through late September, according to data provider Pitchbook. That was more than half of total VC investment during the period. Meanwhile, research from the real estate firm JLL found that the data center vacancy rate stood at a low 2.3% in North America.

In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Guns, Germs, and Steel author Jared Diamond describes how geography and environment shaped early civilization. If the hype is to be believed, artificial intelligence will soon supplant those forces in defining the future. That intelligence doesn’t exist in the physical world, but rather within a virtual geography of servers and fiber optic cables.

While AI may be agnostic as to location, it is matters very much to states, towns, and counties looking for a lifeline in a post-industrial world. Like Richmond County. ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Data-Center_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 00:17:41.345513

He has cited his opposition to the Obama-era Clean Power Plan as a major career achievement.
The commission’s regulatory process is “quasi-judicial,” meaning that it demands evidence-based argumentation from Duke Energy, its critics and other interest groups.","In July, Duke Energy had every reason to expect that the N.C. Utilities Commission would approve its plan to build a 245-megawatt solar project in Richmond County. The facility was in line with its Carolinas Resource Plan, the commission-approved framework for adding more power.

Ultimately, the commission approved the plan, but only after a sharp dissent from its newest member, Donald van der Vaart. The former state environmental-quality secretary downplayed the usefulness of solar power that lacked battery storage, and highlighted how North Carolina’s natural gas supply remains limited.

“These constraints necessitate extending coal-fleet operations to bridge to large-scale nuclear for carbon neutrality by 2050,” he says.

Van der Vaart’s dissent, and his presence on the commission, signals how the regulatory body’s outlook is in flux. It’s partly a function of a restructuring ordered by state Republican leaders, who have gained more sway over North Carolina’s regulatory agencies.

The governor had traditionally appointed all seven members of the Utilities Commission. Now, after a law passed in 2023, the commission is down to five members, with Gov. Josh Stein and legislators each picking two people and the state treasurer selecting the other seat.

The treasurer, Brad Briner, picked van der Vaart. He joined holdovers Karen Kemerait and Floyd McKissick Jr., who were gubernatorial picks, and Bill Brawley and Tommy Tucker, the legislative selections.

McKissick, a Durham Democrat, and Tucker, a Union County Republican, are former state senators. Brawley is a former Mecklenburg County Republican state representative. Kemerait is a Raleigh lawyer whose practice involved energy, water, wastewater and land-use matters. She is a registered Democrat.

Four other members left this year: former chair Charlotte Mitchell, Kimberly Duffley, Jeffrey Hughes and Steve Levitas.

Representatives of N.C. environmental groups have long been critical of van der Vaart, a chemical engineer who worked in Gov. Pat McCrory’s administration. He has cited his opposition to the Obama-era Clean Power Plan as a major career achievement.

The Utilities Commission is ultimately beholden to the law as written by the General Assembly, says former state Rep. John Szoka, a Cumberland County Republican who now heads the Michigan-based Conservative Energy Network. That means balancing a decrease in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions with keeping electricity prices as low as possible.

“All five of them, and I think they’ve shown it so far, are administering the law as regulators are required to by the law, and they’re going to do that to the best of their ability,” Szoka says.

The commission’s regulatory process is “quasi-judicial,” meaning that it demands evidence-based argumentation from Duke Energy, its critics and other interest groups.

It’s “more important than ever that anybody who comes before the board really has their stuff together when they present whatever position they are representing,” he adds. “It’s not feelings; it’s facts, because these cases are decided on facts.”

The commission’s main job in 2026 is reviewing Duke’s revised Carolinas Resource Plan, which envisions pumping the brakes on solar development in favor of using more gas combustion turbines and operating the utility’s coal-fired power plants longer than previous projections.

The revision follows the General Assembly’s passage this year of Senate Bill 266, which retains the ultimate goal of making power production carbon-neutral by 2050. But the state is no longer asking Duke to get 70% of the way there by 2030.

While about half of Duke’s total generation capacity comes from nuclear, the utility is cautious about building new reactors. Its filing says the company will undertake planning work, but is noncommittal about following through. But Duke needs to start placing orders for reactor vessels and other equipment by 2028 to build more of the gigawatt-size facilities it now operates.

The slowdown on solar, meanwhile, partly stems from the Trump administration’s adamant opposition to tax credits and other incentives for renewables. That is forcing adjustments in long-term planning as some existing solar deals may fall though, Duke’s filing noted. ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Utilities_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 21:58:21.179351

Here are five elections where rising power bills, offshore wind, data centers, and the future of clean energy are all on the line.

Georgia Public Service Commission

Every state has an obscure regulatory body that oversees for-profit electric utilities, including their requests to raise rates and build new energy projects. In Georgia, it’s called the Public Service Commission, and unlike in most states, voters get to decide who’s on it.

Georgia’s current five utility commissioners — all Republicans — have been in power beyond their elected terms because lawsuits have delayed elections. On Tuesday, two of those commissioners will finally face voters.

In one race, Republican incumbent Tim Echols faces a challenge from Democrat Alicia Johnson. Echols calls for more nuclear power and battery storage and has touted his support for solar. Johnson wants more solar power and battery storage, including rooftop solar and other distributed energy resources, but is less bullish on nuclear.

In the other PSC race, Democrat Peter Hubbard is looking to unseat Republican incumbent Fitz Johnson (no relation to Alicia Johnson). Hubbard, an energy modeler, has a long track record of challenging the PSC, and told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John he’d push for more solar and less gas if elected. Johnson didn’t respond to Canary’s requests for comment, but has called this election a contest of ​“affordable, reliable energy vs. costly climate mandates.”

New Jersey governor

Democratic U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill is facing off against Republican former state legislator Jack Ciattarelli to lead New Jersey — and energy affordability has become a key issue. The state saw one of the country’s biggest electricity rate increases over the last year, and Sherrill has promised to build more clean energy generation to address the problem.

Ciattarelli, meanwhile, has blamed New Jersey’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for rising power prices. He’s also not a fan of offshore wind — just take a look at the koozies his campaign store is selling.

Virginia governor

Rising power bills are also a hot topic in Virginia, where Democratic former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger is facing Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the governor’s race.

Virginia is already known as the data-center capital of the world, and continued development could drive up power demand even further. Spanberger has called for exploring energy-efficiency programs and virtual power plants as potential solutions, and supports solar, offshore wind, and nuclear development to meet demand. Earle-Sears is more critical of solar and wind power, but is a strong supporter of small nuclear reactors.

New York City mayor

There’s a three-way race underway to lead New York City, where Democrat Zohran Mamdani is polling ahead of independent candidate Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

The future mayor will have a lot of say in implementation of the city’s landmark law requiring cuts in climate emissions from buildings, and Mamdani has promised to strictly enforce the measure. Mamdani has also woven climate action into his plans to make the city more affordable, including by turning dozens of schools into renewables-equipped resilience hubs.

Sliwa, for his part, has campaigned against battery storage development, and he celebrated when a major battery project planned for Staten Island was canceled this month. (More on that news below.)

More big energy stories

A big week for conventional nuclear reactors

Small nuclear reactors may be generating more buzz, but conventional reactors are at the center of three big nuclear deals announced in the U.S. this past week. The first comes from the Trump administration, which announced an $80 million plan to work with nuclear reactor developer Westinghouse, Brookfield Asset Management, and uranium supplier Cameco to build several Westinghouse AP1000 reactors across the U.S.

In Iowa, Google announced it’s partnering with utility NextEra Energy to restart the Duane Arnold nuclear power plant. The facility has been shut down for five years, but Google hopes to get it back online by 2029 to help power its growing data-center fleet. And in South Carolina, state-owned utility Santee Cooper is tapping Brookfield Asset Management to finish construction of two AP1000 reactors that the utility abandoned back in 2018.

A win and a loss for battery storage

Large-scale battery development saw both a breakthrough and a setback over this past week. The good news for storage came from Form Energy, which has started installing its 100-hour iron-air batteries at a Great River Energy storage project in Minnesota. The startup is building those first-of-a-kind batteries at its West Virginia factory, where it hopes to speed up production as it works out some early kinks.

But on New York’s Staten Island, Hecate Energy has withdrawn plans to build a 650-megawatt battery storage facility. The company didn’t give a reason for the termination, but it did face opposition from residents and local leaders.

The petition comes after the federal government said Montana can use “narrative” water quality standards, subjective criteria such as odor, color and the presence of undesirable aquatic life, instead of statistical metrics, to establish regulatory limits on nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.

Upper Missouri Waterkeeper announced Oct. 29 that it is petitioning the state to hold off on wastewater permitting until a “lawful, science-based plan is in place to protect Montana’s waterways from nutrient pollution.”

Upper Missouri Waterkeeper is working alongside eight other environmental nonprofits to circulate the petition as part of an effort to ensure DEQ has a clear plan to mitigate nutrient pollution as it attempts to emerge from an extended period of permitting limbo wrought by a yearslong water quality tug-of-war between the state Legislature, environmentalists, industry groups and federal and state regulators.

Nitrogen and phosphorus can contribute to persistent algal blooms that deprive fish and other aquatic life of the dissolved oxygen they need to thrive. Wastewater from municipal treatment plants, mines and refineries is a common contributor of “point-source” nutrient pollution, but diffuse sources that are harder to regulate, such as poorly maintained septic systems, fertilizer runoff and livestock manure, can also contaminate rivers and lakes.

About one-third of the state’s waterways were considered “impaired” by nutrient pollution in 2020, when the DEQ last took a pulse check on the health of Montana waters.

Earlier this year, while testifying in favor of a bill to transition the state back to narrative water quality standards, DEQ told state lawmakers it had stopped issuing new wastewater discharge permits and allowed some of its permits to be “administratively continued” using whatever standards they had been granted under, even if the permit had expired. The agency described that situation as unsustainable.

In April, the Legislature passed that proposal, House Bill 664, by a healthy margin: 103 of the body’s 150 lawmakers voted to support the measure. Since it intersects with federal regulations, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had to sign off on the revised standards before DEQ, its state counterpart, could implement them.

That happened Oct. 3 when EPA Regional Administrator Cyrus Western told DEQ that HB 664 could stand, arguing that DEQ’s proposed approach to water quality regulation will “protect designated uses” under the Clean Water Act, the federal law Congress passed in 1972 to clean up contaminated rivers.

Guy Alsentzer, with Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, said in an emailed press release that DEQ lacks an implementation plan, and that lack will lead to the degradation of “countless river miles.”

“Right now, DEQ is flying blind without a plan in place to determine — and prevent — harmful levels of nutrient pollution for most Montana waterways. This hands-off approach to regulating point-source pollution is a recipe for disaster,” he said.

In an email to MTFP, DEQ maintained that prior to adopting numeric criteria in 2015, the state used narrative nutrient criteria to protect Montana’s water bodies for decades. The numeric standards never applied to Flathead Lake and “most large rivers,” she added.

Asked if DEQ has emerged from its permitting standstill, agency spokesperson Madison McGeffers wrote that the agency has been “focused on developing the methodology for applying the narrative nutrient standard and reviewing administratively continued permits.”

McGeffers noted that the agency has drafted a nutrient-specific modification to the Sibanye-Stillwater platinum and palladium mine permit, which is currently out for public comment. The old plan called for a limit of 15 pounds of nitrogen (a byproduct of the mine’s dynamite usage) entering the East Boulder River per day. The new plan seeks to increase that threshold using an averaged calculation and extend the mine’s timeline for complying with stricter limits in the future. It also includes monitoring and reporting requirements.

Asked about the mine’s permit application in a follow-up interview with MTFP, Alsentzer said the proposal is a departure from science-based regulations that are protective of water quality, and said they represent a new playbook for industry groups.

Alsentzer argued that “there’s no reasonable dispute” that the mine is the largest single source of nutrient pollution on the East Boulder River and that the mine discharges more nutrients than was previously authorized or understood. It appears, he said, that companies like Sibanye-Stillwater were biding their time, waiting for HB 664 to go into effect rather than working toward increasingly protective water quality targets laid out in their permits.

“Nobody wants to play by the old rulebook anymore,” Alsentzer said. “We’re going back to subjective decision-making without clear guidance, and I think it’s ridiculous.”

After the public comment period for the mine’s revised permit closes on Nov. 7, DEQ will make a final determination.

Other groups circulating the petition include Gallatin River Task Force, Bitterroot River Protection Association, Citizens for a Better Flathead, Montana Environmental Information Center, Gallatin Wildlife Association, Clark Fork Coalition, Flathead Lakers, and Alliance for the Wild Rockies. As of Friday afternoon, Oct. 31, the petition had garnered 102 signatures.",https://montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Boyer_ClarkFork-5116.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 07:59:00.854533

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.","FORT COLLINS, Colo (AP) — President Donald Trump’s efforts to help the U.S. coal industry at home are being undermined by falling sales abroad amid his trade war with China, new government reports show.

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,” coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to “keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. The rest was thermal coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, according to Blumenfeld.

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.

Appalachia would therefore benefit most from a resumption of U.S. coal exports to China, noted Blumenfeld by email.

“There is optimism,” Blumenfeld wrote. “But there is little documentation to back that up right now.”

Most coal headed for China last year went through Baltimore, with lesser amounts via the Norfolk, Virginia, area and Gulf of Mexico, according to Blumenfeld.

Relatively little thermal coal from the Western U.S. is exported due to the cost of hauling it by rail to the West Coast, where there has also been political resistance to building port facilities to export more coal.",https://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Coal_Exports_07035.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 19:18:47.757956

Construction’s contributions to North Carolina can be counted in many ways. The $1 billion Pearl complex has led to a highly anticipated medical school and a separate magnet attracting leading global surgeons to study in Charlotte. Toyota’s $14 billion battery plant in Randolph County strengthens the Tar Heel state’s participation in creating a clean energy future.

CN Hotels’ development of a dual-branded Hilton hotel gave the state capital the highest rooftbar in the Triangle. Northwood Development has turned Charlotte’s Ballantyne area, long known for its massive office complex, into a popular place to eat, drink and enjoy live entertainment.

Then there’s Champion Credit Union’s decision to move forward with a new corporate headquarters in Haywood County, demonstrating the resiliency of Canton residents affected by Tropical Storm Fred and the closing of a dominant regional employer. In Bessemer City, a long-abandoned Gaston County textile mill now offers 139 affordable housing units.

Making a difference in communities was a common theme as Business North Carolina recognizes the most important new buildings to open in the year ending June 30. This marks the 12th year for the project, which is put together by the BNC editorial team with input from representatives of the state’s construction and architecture industries.

The list includes nine category winners and eight honorable mentions. The buildings represent some of the biggest investments in state history, some of its tallest office towers and largest residential developments, as well as hospital facilities that promise better access to healthcare. Renovation projects that preserved cultural heritage also show up on the list.

Construction contributed $41.4 billion to the state’s gross domestic product last year, about 5.6% of the total. The industry employs about 280,000 workers in the rapidly developing state.

Architects: Ayers Saint Gross (Baltimore) CO Architects (Los Angeles) and Neighboring Concepts (Charlotte)Cost: $965 million Size: 643,000 square feet (Phase 1)

The 26-acre innovation district is built around the Charlotte campus of Wake Forest University’s School of Medicine, merging the city’s health, research and education sectors. The Pearl opened its first phase in June as a collaboration between Atrium Health, Baltimore-based Wexford Science & Technology and Ventas,

a Chicago-based real estate investment trust.

The Pearl’s first buildings include the 14-story Howard R. Levine Center for Education, which includes the medical school, and a 10-story research building, which houses IRCAD North America.

Those structures include 643,000 square feet of lab, academic, research, office and retail space. Plans call for as much as 4.2 million square feet of additional development over the next 15 years. Construction of a hotel is expected to start next year, Atrium officials say.

The Pearl is projected to generate more than 5,500 on-site jobs and spur the addition of 6,000 more across the region, entailing an investment topping $1.5 billion.

The IRCAD North America site will attract more than 8,000 surgeons annually to study emerging techniques in cardiovascular, neuro and orthopedic surgeries, among others. The first course launched in September.

CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS

Champion Credit Union Canton

Developer: Champion Credit Union (Canton)

Contractor: NewGround International/Beverly-Grant (Chesterfield, Missouri)

Architect: NewGround International (Chesterfield, Missouri)

Cost: $23 million

Size: 30,000 square feet

Champion Credit Union finished its new headquarters in May, overlooking the former paper mill where seven employees of the former Champion mill came together in 1932 to found what was then known as Champion Savings and Loan. Building plans were announced in 2022, but construction began after Pactiv Evergreen announced the plant’s closing in March 2023, idling more than 1,000 people in a town of 4,400 residents.

The project became a testament to the town’s resiliency and the credit union’s commitment to Canton, says CEO Jake Robinson.

The mostly stone and glass facade offers picturesque views of the surrounding Great Smoky Mountain range. The new building consolidates back office operations and administrative work that had been done in three separate buildings.

The city of Canton bought the credit union’s two former buildings for a new town hall and police department offices. Both need renovations that are expected to be completed over the next 18 months. City staffers still operate out of Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers after Pigeon River flooding during Tropical Storm Fred slammed Canton in August 2021.

The 12-story office tower begun in September 2022 is the first building completed as part of the $1 billion, 40-acre development known as The Exchange. Over the next seven to 10 years, it is slated to include 990,000 square feet of office space, 125,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, 300 hotel rooms and 1,275 apartments, condos and townhomes.

Building features include outdoor meeting spaces on each floor, an amenity terrace on the top floor and an eight-story, double-helix parking deck with 1,585 spaces. An adjacent park will include walking trails, an amphitheater and connections to an existing greenway.

It’s Raleigh’s first WELL- and LEED-certified project, tied to sustainable energy and environmental designs.

Plans call for a skybridge to connect 1000 Social with a mirror-image counterpart, 2000 Social, once that building is constructed.

Uzun + Case were the structural engineers; Crenshaw Consulting Engineers handled mechanical, plumbing and electrical; and Advanced Civil Design was in charge of civil engineering. RJTR was the interior designer and Studio Outside was the landscape designer.

Fifty percent of the building was pre-leased. The first tenant, Raleigh-based Whitley Law Firm, moved into its second-floor office last year. CBRE managed leasing.

Asheville Regional Airport North Concourse Fletcher

Developer: Greater Asheville Regional Airport Authority

Contractor: Parsons (Chantilly, Virginia)

Architect: Gresham Smith (Nashville, Tennessee)

Cost: $228 million

Size: 136,000 square feet

Asheville Regional Airport completed construction of its North Concourse in June, where most of its operations will take place for the next two-plus years. Planning began in 2019, while demolition of the old north concourse started in August 2023.

The North Concourse includes Gates 7 through 12, new restaurants, an art gallery and floor-to-ceiling, electrochromic windows that offer picturesque views of the Blue Ridge Mountains while helping keep the terminal cool on hot days.

The project is part of a five-year, almost $400 million construction project expected to

be completed by early 2028. It’s the largest infrastructure project in the airport’s

64-year history.

Workers are also replacing the South Concourse, which will include a new main entrance and Gates 1 through 6. Some operations still take place in the “legacy” concourse, including baggage claims and car rentals. Those areas will be replaced in phases.

Once complete, the new concourse will be 150% larger.

The Asheville airport attracted more than 2 million passengers for the first time in 2023, and did it again in 2024. The number of nonstop destination flights increased from 10 to 27 between 2013 and 2023.

RENOVATION

Lofts at Osage Mill Bessemer City

Developer: WinnDevelopment (Boston)

Contractor: Rehab Builders (Winston-Salem)

Architect: Tise-Kiester Architects (Chapel Hill)

Cost: $36 million

Size: 250,000 square feet

A long-vacant textile mill now has 139 apartments to rent in an affordable housing project that city leaders say will be key for downtown redevelopment. Town founder John Smith built the mill in 1896 for his Southern Cotton Mill. It employed more than 400 in its heyday, but closed for good in 1995. After almost 30 years of vacancy, construction started on the project in 2023. The first residents moved into the one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments earlier this year.

The redevelopment preserved the building’s brick exterior and historic features while adding a resident lounge, business center and fitness room. Skylights bring natural light into the building’s interior atriums, illuminating its wooden beams and original flooring.

The North Carolina Housing Finance Agency supported the project with tax-exempt bonds issued by the Gastonia Housing Authority. Bank of America provided construction and permanent financing, as well as equity under the federal

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, the federal Historic Tax Credit program and the state’s Mill Rehabilitation Tax Credit program.

The Lofts at Osage Mill is WinnDevelopment’s first adaptive reuse project in North Carolina. Collaboration with Duke Energy ensured the building’s design conformed to Energy Star guidelines to maximize energy efficiency.

Apartments will be rented to households earning 60% of the area’s median income, which is less than $53,880 for a two-person household. Monthly rent for the 50 one-bedroom apartments will be $1,125; rent will be $1,352 for the 77 two-bedroom units; and $1,160 for the 12 three-bedroom units. As of mid-September, all but 15 of the apartments were occupied.

Wabash Valley Resources will restart a coal gasification plant to produce ammonia fertilizer, investing in a coal community and supporting Corn Belt farmers.

PROJECT SUMMARY

In October 2025, LPO closed a nearly $1.6 billion loan to Wabash Valley Resources, LLC to help finance an ammonia fertilizer plant in West Terre Haute, Indiana. The loan from the Energy Dominance Financing Program will restart and repurpose a coal gasification plant idled since 2016 for the production of 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia per year. The gasifier will utilize coal from a nearby Southern Indiana mine and petcoke as feedstock. By investing in a coal community, the Wabash project will bring the gasification plant back online to produce ammonia fertilizer, a vital resource for farmers in the Corn Belt. This project will secure American fertilizer supply chains for American farmers and support President Trump's mission to unleash American energy dominance.

TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION

Wabash Valley Resources will be the first domestic producer located in the Corn Belt to produce low-carbon ammonia for local farmers and co-ops in the region.

ECONOMIC IMPACT

A host of economic benefits are expected from the Wabash project: The low-carbon ammonia resulting from this facility will be cost-competitive compared to existing ammonia imports, helping to drive down costs for local businesses and consumers. The project location in West Terre Haute significantly alleviates supply chain risk, helping to secure and create affordable fertilizer supply chains and strengthen national and food security in the U.S. Finally, the project may utilize up to 150,000 tons per year of Indiana coal, supporting good-paying mining jobs and boosting local tax revenues.

The project is projected to create hundreds of jobs for Americans—up to 500 construction positions during the development of the project, up to 125 operational positions, 35 contract maintenance and services positions, and up to 90 local transportation positions for project operations.

The trio of agreements brings Meta’s total solar purchases to over 3 gigawatts of capacity this year. Solar is cheap and quick to build, and as a result, it has become a go-to power source for tech companies as their data center fleets multiply in size.

Meta yesterday announced two agreements in Louisiana that see it buying the environmental attributes of a combined 385 megawatts of electricity. Both projects are expected to be completed two years from now.

They follow on the heels of a larger deal announced Monday in which Meta bought 600 megawatts from a massive solar farm near Lubbock, Texas. The project will also start commercial operations in 2027.

While the Texas power plant won’t connect directly to Meta data centers, it will feed into the local grid, offsetting use by the facilities.

The Louisiana deals, though, involve purchasing of certificates that allow Meta to offset its carbon-intensive sources of power.

Such environmental attribute certificates (EACs), sometimes called renewable energy certificates, have been criticized by experts for obscuring the true carbon footprint of tech companies’ operations, which have ballooned as AI has driven up electricity use.

EACs were introduced years ago when renewables were costly relative to fossil fuel generators. They let anyone buy the electricity, but also gave companies an option to pay extra to offset their own emissions — and offset the higher costs of renewable power. They helped encourage developers to build more renewable projects.

But the cost of new solar and wind has dropped dramatically since then, with renewables undercutting new fossil power and sometimes existing coal and natural gas power plants. EACs don’t provide the same incentive as before, and experts question how much additional renewable power they stimulate.

If companies truly want to offset their new energy use from AI, they should be encouraging developers to build new renewable capacity, experts argue.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1475927398.jpeg?resize=1200,674",N,,2025-10-31 19:18:51.823418

The Honorable Lee M. Zeldin

Administrator

Environmental Protection Agency

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.

Washington, D.C. 20460

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We write to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) “Set 2” rule, to express strong support for the reallocation of 100% of the waived gallons from any granted Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) and urge EPA to finalize the rule as quickly as possible.

At a time when farm families and rural communities face tough markets and economic uncertainty, we appreciate EPA’s recognition of the vital role American biofuels and agriculture play in lowering fuel prices and advancing American energy dominance. The proposed volumes in the Set 2 rule represent a meaningful commitment to supporting cheaper homegrown fuels, farm income, and rural economies. These volumes matter —not just to biofuel producers, but to the farmers who grow the corn, soybeans, and other feedstocks that power this economy, and to every American who enjoys lower prices at the pump because of biofuels. A strong RVO means stronger commodity prices, more stable markets, and greater opportunity for rural America.

As EPA considers its supplemental proposal, we urge the agency to fully reallocate 100% of the waived gallons for compliance years 2023–2025. Without full restoration the benefits of the original proposal won’t reach the farm gate or lower prices at the pump. Farmers and rural businesses will ultimately bear the brunt of weakened demand and lower prices.

Congress created the RFS to boost biofuel use for the benefit of American families, the economy, and our energy security. It is critical that the EPA follow the directive outlined in the RFS to issue timely and reflective RVOs. Every day the rule remains unfinished means uncertainty for producers and missed opportunities for rural communities. Promptly finalizing the rule will allow these benefits to take hold sooner—bringing stability, investment, and growth to the places that need it most.

“That order from the Department of Energy has laid out a clear path to cost recovery,” he said.
The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Campbell cost figures, nor did MISO.
Because DOE did not respond to their petition for reconsideration of the Campbell order within 30 days, the environmental groups and the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois have asked the D.C.
Instead, running the plant for the past five months has cost close to three times that annual amount.","The Trump administration’s emergency order to keep the huge J.H. Campbell coal plant on Lake Michigan operating past its planned retirement date has cost at least $80 million since May, its operator, Consumers Energy, told regulators and investors this week.

The company said in its third-quarter earnings report Thursday that it would pursue the process laid out in the U.S. Department of Energy’s order for collecting those costs: It will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest.

Even though the peak summer electricity demand season has passed, executives at Consumers, Michigan’s largest energy provider, said that they see no sign of let-up in the emergency orders.

“We expect those to continue for the long-term,” said CEO Garrick Rochow in a conference call for investors. “And we’re prepared to continue to operate the plant and comply with those orders.”

He said the costs—$615,385 per day—should be shared beyond the 1.9 million electricity customers of Consumers Energy. The company plans to propose the tab be split among ratepayers (an estimated 42 million to 45 million electricity customers) in the nine states served by the regional electric grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).

“The benefits go to MISO,” Rochow said. “Not just to our customers, they go to MISO.”

Rochow said the Trump administration envisioned this approach. “That order from the Department of Energy has laid out a clear path to cost recovery,” he said. Consumers Energy will have to apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in order to pass the costs to the ratepayers, and states that oppose such a cost allocation could move to intervene in those proceedings.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued two consecutive 90-day orders—on May 23 and on Aug. 20—to keep the Campbell plant open under the emergency provisions of the Federal Power Act. In the past, such orders have been used to ensure energy delivery at times of natural disasters. But Wright used the act to execute Trump’s agenda to ramp up energy production, saying Campbell needed to stay open to minimize the risk of power outages and address critical grid security issues in the Midwest.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Campbell cost figures, nor did MISO. When he extended the Campbell order in August, Wright said that he was directing MISO “to take every step to minimize cost to the American people.”

“This order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power,” he said in that statement.

But critics say the operation of the 63-year-old plant is generating unnecessary costs as well as pollution. In a September regulatory filing challenging the DOE’s order, a coalition of environmental groups pointed out that even on the day of highest peak demand this summer, MISO had an unused surplus of resources greater than 10 times the power provided by the Campbell plant.

And indeed, according to recent Environmental Protection Agency data, two of the three units at the Campbell plant were not operating at all for about 30 days of the 131 days from the start of the DOE order through Sept. 30. The third unit at the plant only ran for 18 days. Such stoppages could occur for maintenance or simply because the grid operator did not call on the plant to deliver energy to the grid.

“Forcing this unnecessary coal plant to keep operating is bilking consumers for the benefit of the coal industry,” said Michael Lenoff, senior attorney for Earthjustice, which is representing the environmental groups.

Because DOE did not respond to their petition for reconsideration of the Campbell order within 30 days, the environmental groups and the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois have asked the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case. The purpose of the litigation, Lenoff said, is “to stop the administration from harming consumers, trampling markets and unlawfully usurping the authority of states and regulators to make decisions in the public interest.”

Campbell is by far the largest of three fossil fuel electricity plants that are staying open beyond their planned retirements under Trump administration emergency orders. Campbell released 6.6 million metric tons of carbon in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. Talen Energy’s Wagner plant near Baltimore and Constellation Energy’s Eddystone plant just south of Philadelphia, both run on oil and natural gas. Some detail on their costs for keeping open may emerge next week, when Talen and Constellation report their third-quarter earnings.

Consumers Energy, which is continuing to work toward its previously stated goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, had projected that the retirement of the Campbell plant would save its customers $600 million over the next 20 years, or $30 million per year. Instead, running the plant for the past five months has cost close to three times that annual amount.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2225114175-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 18:18:28.308509

Europe has imposed tariffs on subsidized Chinese electric cars and begun pulling back from Chinese infrastructure.","Advantage Beijing. The just-brokered US-China trade truce demonstrates its ability to withstand Western pressure, while Europe delays decisive action and American power is systematically challenged.

When Washington imposed tariffs around the globe, China flexed its muscles by halting critical mineral exports and magnets crucial for the world’s car, semiconductor, and aerospace industries, not just to the US, but also to Europe. The strategy worked. China agreed only to pause critical mineral export controls for a year. In return, the US cut its tariffs and will allow China to buy sophisticated semiconductors.

Beijing’s success reflects a relentless two-pronged drive to reduce reliance on Western suppliers while pursuing an aggressive, ambitious export offensive. Huawei is producing GPU artificial intelligence chips, reducing dependence on global market leader NVIDIA. European telephone vendors Nokia and Ericsson are losing market share in China as Beijing subjects foreign equipment to new “national security reviews” that slow approvals or block them altogether.

Abroad, Beijing pushes its global footprint through the Belt and Road Initiative, which continues to deliver strategic infrastructure — ports, railways, energy projects — that reinforce Chinese influence on trade arteries from Asia to Africa and the Mediterranean. COSCO’s 67% stake in Greece’s Port of Piraeus, now one of Europe’s busiest container terminals, is a prime example.

In response, the West looks divided. US policymakers see technological dependence on China as a direct national security risk and have taken strong measures to restrict Chinese exports. Europe talks of “de-risking,” but the term has become a linguistic shield against hard choices. By June 2025, only ten of the European Union’s 27 member states had imposed restrictions on “high-risk vendors” such as Huawei and ZTE. Together, those two Chinese telecom firms still hold roughly 30–35% of Europe’s mobile-network infrastructure market — barely down from 2020 levels.

Beyond telecoms, Chinese firms have penetrated clean tech supply chains. Europe’s solar panel industry was hollowed out years ago, and now wind turbines face a similar threat. Chinese producers, heavily subsidized and vertically integrated, undercut European rivals in price and scale. Brussels has responded with investigations and provisional tariffs, but the underlying dependency remains: Europe relies on Chinese components to meet its own climate targets.

The US has gone further in both scope and symbolism. Washington banned Huawei and ZTE from US telecom networks in 2021 and placed them on export control lists that cut off advanced semiconductors and software updates. It has also initiated investigations into possible evasion of those bans, signaling that enforcement — not just rhetoric — matters.

Yet, as the recent Sino-American trade talks revealed, Washington’s ability to decouple from China is limited. China’s monopoly over rare earths is far from its only weapon. Another is China’s dominant position in the global pharmaceutical supply chain, producing 80% to 90% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients that power the generic drugs filling the majority of US prescriptions, including antibiotics.

The US’s ability to shape Europe’s China policy has also diminished. To many Europeans, Beijing has at times appeared a more consistent partner than Washington. Yet this is precisely the moment for America and Europe to close ranks: only through a coordinated transatlantic approach can they hope to meet the China challenge. A realistic China transatlantic strategy must rest on three key measures: de-risking, reciprocity, and industrial resilience.

First, time-bound de-risking. The allies should set explicit “out by” dates for high-risk vendors in critical sectors. Clear timelines create predictability for operators and investors while signaling seriousness to partners. So far, Europe has struggled to match the pace and clarity of such US efforts.

Second, require reciprocity. Access to public tenders, research funding, and infrastructure projects should depend on comparable openness for American and European firms in China. In Europe, the International Procurement Instrument represents a start, but it must be used routinely, not as a diplomatic exception. In the US, there might be little political appetite for collaboration with China on research and R&D — but Europe should step in as a mediator, keeping selective engagement alive where it serves shared Western interests.

Third, promote industrial resilience. Europe and the US must build domestic capacity in strategic technologies. Trade-defense instruments can buy time; they cannot substitute for production. Europe has imposed tariffs on subsidized Chinese electric cars and begun pulling back from Chinese infrastructure. It is attempting to boost domestic semiconductor production, particularly of chips needed for its important automotive business.

The US has done more. Earlier this month, NVIDIA announced that the firm had begun producing its advanced Blackwell AI chips at a TSMC plant in Arizona — marking the first time a Blackwell wafer had been made on American soil. NVIDIA is also assembling its AI supercomputers in Texas and manufacturing networking equipment in California.

None of these measures involves severing economic ties with China. The goal must be to be able to engage on one’s own terms rather than under constraint. In practice, that means diversifying suppliers, enforcing security standards, and ensuring that political leverage cannot be exercised through technical dependencies.

China’s ability to decouple is redefining the global balance of economic power. Its domestic substitution drive, industrial policy coordination, and outbound investment drive give it a competitive advantage. The question is not whether China can decouple — it has already shown that it can, selectively and effectively. The unanswered question is whether Europe and the US can adapt.

The move is a pivot for the company, which was poised to ramp up electric vehicle production until President Donald Trump discontinued federal $7,500 subsidies for EV buyers on September 1.

General Motors will launch the centralized computing platform and next-generation electrical architecture starting with the Cadillac Escalade IQ in 2028.

“The new design represents a fundamental reimagining of how GM vehicles are built, and how they can be updated over time,” the company said in its announcement of the new technology on October 22.

Already, more than 4.5 million GM vehicles can receive over-the-air vehicle system updates, a number growing by about two million vehicles per year. Last year alone, 1.6 million vehicles received coordinated software updates this way.

Now, the company is taking this capability farther to fashion a new approach to mobility that GM says “…unlocks new levels of performance, scalability, and software efficiency.”

The revised architecture cuts the number of vehicle modules needed under the hood, simplifying vehicle design, improving reliability, and enabling faster software updates, GM said.

GM will share software across its portfolio, both electric and gas-powered vehicles, large and small, so that GM vehicles will be always connected, awake, and available, with near-instant responsiveness to remote commands.

GM EV Sales Slow, So Are Tesla’s

In the first quarter of 2024, U.S. year-over-year growth rate for electric cars was 15 percent, compared to the overall market, which was up 4.7 percent. Year-over-year growth of electric car sales did slow compared to the 2022-2023 numbers, which rose by about 50 percent. Still, electric vehicles were 7.8 percent of the new-car market compared to 7.1 percent in the same period of 2023.

Tesla as a brand is experiencing slowing demand as shown in the company’s production and delivery report for Q1 2024. Tesla reported delivery of about 387,000 vehicles, missing its target level of 430,000.

Still, the Tesla Model Y remains the best-selling EV in the United States, and it continues to have “an outsize impact” on overall EV sales, according to Lawrence Yap, writing for the website Green Cars in May 2024.

“There are many reasons why Tesla’s numbers have fallen off. Some pundits have speculated that CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political leanings are beginning to turn off swaths of mainstream buyers, which are key to the success of the Model Y and Model 3,” Yap writes. “A more likely explanation is that, aside from the all-new and low-volume Cybertruck, the brand’s line is aging … and competition from other brands is increasing.”

On April 25, 2023, GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra said that General Motors’ electric car, the Bolt, and Bolt EUV would be discontinued at the end of 2023 to make room for GM’s “new generation of electric vehicles.”

General Motors phased the electric Bolt out of production, and its sales of electric vehicles dropped 21 percent, as the new Blazer electric SUV faced production delays and stop-sale orders.

One bright spot was the Cadillac Lyriq, which nearly quintupled sales compared to the first quarter of 2023.

Another potential bright spot is the reintroduction of the Chevy Bolt EV for 2027 at a price point that hovers around $30,000.

The 2027 Bolt designers focused on a refined, familiar look paired with the latest safety technologies, software updates, and driver-assistance features. The Bolt is shaping up to be “a practical, budget-conscious EV for everyday drivers,” GM says.

With the Blazer EV and the new Silverado EV now back in production, Yap expects GM’s numbers to grow from its roughly three percent EV share of the market.

GM’s North American President Duncan Aldred said earlier this year, “There’s no doubt we’ll see lower EV sales next quarter after tax credits end, and it may take several months for the market to normalize. We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won’t overproduce.”

The Role of Tariffs

While starting on a program for producing more electric cars and trucks during the administration of President Joe Biden, GM and other American automakers had to pivot when President Donald Trump took office on January 20. Companies had to change their plans as Trump said immediately that he was going to support the use of fossil fuels, reversing the U.S. policy of working to defeat climate change by limiting the burning of diesel, oil, and gasoline.

On Friday, October 17, Trump issued a Presidential Proclamation invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, imposing a 25 percent tariff on imports of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and related parts as well as a separate 10 percent on imports of buses. These tariffs will take effect at 12:01 am ET on November 1.

The 25 percent tariff on imports of medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts applies to parts used in medium- and heavy-duty trucks, such as engines, transmissions, tires, and chassis.

Medium- and heavy-duty trucks include vehicles like large pick-up trucks.

Under a new Tariff Offset Program manufacturers using U.S. assembled medium- or heavy-duty truck parts may receive a tariff credit equal to 3.75% of the aggregate value of all trucks assembled in the United States from 2025–2030. This reflects the duty owed when a 25% tariff is applied to 15% of the value of a U.S. assembled medium- and heavy-duty truck.

This credit can be used to reduce the tariffs that truck manufacturers owe on medium- and heavy-duty truck parts.

Products subject to this tariff WILL NOT be subject to additional or existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper, cars and car parts, or lumber. They also will not be subject to reciprocal tariffs that the U.S. has placed on Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and India.

In an October 21 Letter to Shareholders, GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra thanked President Donald Trump for relieving the pressure of tariffs on the company.

“I also want to thank the President and his team for the important tariff updates they made on Friday. The MSRP [manufacturers suggested retail price] offset program will help make U.S.-produced vehicles more competitive over the next five years, and GM is very well positioned as we invest to increase our already significant domestic sourcing and manufacturing footprint,” Barra told GM shareholders.

Earlier this year, General Motors announced $4 billion in capital investments to onshore production at plants in Tennessee, Kansas, and Michigan over the next two years, Barra explained.

“Once these investments come online, we plan to produce more than two million vehicles per year in the United States,” she said.

“We are also investing close to $1 billion to build a new generation of advanced, fuel-efficient V8 engines in New York. Importantly, we are maintaining our capital discipline while adding this production and creating new jobs,” Barra declared.

Barra knows GM better than most other people in the automotive universe. She started working for GM in 1980 as a student when she was 18, checking fender panels and inspecting hoods, and she used this job to pay for her college tuition. Later, she held engineering and administrative positions at GM and managed its Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant.

GM Takes a Fresh Approach

Now, a new presidential administration with new goals has GM moving toward a centralized computing design that unlocks new levels of performance, scalability, and software efficiency.

The updated architecture builds on GM’s Vehicle Intelligence Platform, which launched in 2020 to allow secure over-the-air updates.

In 2022, GM unified dozens of infotainment modules into a single computing platform. The company also consolidated multiple advanced driver assistance systems into one. The new platform consolidates dozens of electronic control units into a unified computing core that coordinates every subsystem in the vehicle in real time, the company explained.

Much like a smartphone’s single, powerful microprocessor that orchestrates everything from camera to messages, this centralized approach connects every system – propulsion, steering, braking, infotainment, and safety – through a high-speed Ethernet backbone.

This has the potential to drive “dramatic change for customers,” Barra explained to the GM shareholders that hit a series of bullet points.

– Growing to deliver 10 times more software updates for new features than our previous system.

– Real-time safety updates in a self-driving system that reacts in milliseconds and evolves with each autonomous update – even faster than our current system.

– 1,000 times more bandwidth for faster connectivity, richer entertainment, and future AI workloads.

Under the hood

– At the heart of the system is a liquid-cooled central computing unit powered by next-generation processors such as NVIDIA Thor. That core connects to three aggregators, serving as hubs for the vehicle’s different zones. Instead of wiring hundreds of sensors and actuators directly to the central processor, the aggregators act as translators. They convert sensor signals into a unified digital language, and route commands back to the correct hardware.

This design delivers two major advantages, Barra said.

– Hardware freedom: Vehicle-specific components stay isolated from the software layer, so GM can swap suppliers or upgrade parts like brake actuators, cameras, displays, and other components without rewriting core code.

– Radical simplification: The new architecture simplifies the network topology. Instead of hundreds of point-to-point connections creating complex wiring and software integration challenges, you get clean “star-network” topologies with aggregators fanning out to their local zones.

Built to Scale

With up to 35 times more AI computing power, as well as TOPS, trillions of operations per second, for autonomy, and a two-to-four multiplier boost in infotainment performance, GM’s platform is engineered with headroom as the company builds next-generation features, the GM leader explained.

“GM’s new platform is engineered to support both electric and internal-combustion vehicles. A single software and computing foundation means innovations developed for one vehicle type can be rapidly scaled across the entire portfolio,” Barra said, “accelerating feature deployment while upholding GM’s standards for safety, cybersecurity, and reliability.”

Eyes-off Driving?

General Motors says it is evolving into a new era of transportation. The company announced plans to bring “eyes-off” driving to market in 2028, debuting on the Cadillac ESCALADE IQ electric SUV.

GM says it has already mapped 600,000 miles of hands-free roads in North America, and customers have driven 700 million miles with Super Cruise “without a single reported crash attributed to the system.

“This combination of technology, scale, a decade of real-world deployment experience, and safety systems developed and tested for Super Cruise gives us the foundation to deliver the next phase of personal autonomy,” GM reasons.

Barra Welcomes a New Chapter

By combining centralized computing, software consolidation, and GM’s global scale, this architecture marks the beginning of a new chapter for the company’s vehicles, Barra told the shareholders and listed the benefits they will enjoy:

– Cars that learn and improve throughout their lifetime.

– Architectures that deliver real-time intelligence and faster autonomy.

– Platforms that bring the efficiency of the digital world into the physical one.

– Delivering 10 times more software updates for new features than GM’s previous system.

– Real-time safety updates in a self-driving system that reacts in milliseconds and evolves with each autonomous update.

– 1,000 times more bandwidth for faster connectivity, richer entertainment, and future AI workloads.

Barra is not the type of CEO to take a negative view of change. Instead, she took a positive tone, saying, “GM’s new computing platform will connect every GM vehicle to a smarter, faster, and continuously improving future.”

Unlike most states, Virginia does not limit corporate contributions to campaigns, enabling Dominion to spend nearly $8.3 million, as of October 15th, in an attempt to hand-pick some of the representatives who select its regulators responsible for overseeing its business and setting the rates the utility can charge to its customers. The financial stakes are growing as demand for electricity skyrockets from data centers, which could soon account for 50% of Dominion’s revenues, according to Scott Castle, the utility’s Vice President of Regulatory Affairs.

Dominion spread its millions among 75 primary and general election candidates this cycle, with 48 still in the running—including Attorney General (AG) Jason Miyares, the top recipient of Dominion cash this year. Virginia State Board of Elections filings show Miyares has accepted $1.35 million from Dominion, while simultaneously leading the office that serves as the consumer advocate for utility customers in Virginia. Miyares’ office is currently intervening in a Dominion rate case that could increase monthly bills for customers by an average of nearly $22 if approved by the State Corporation Commission (SCC), which is responsible for determining how high to set utility bills and profits.

Virginia is one of only two states that selects commissioners via election by the General Assembly, whose members also pass legislation that determines how utilities are regulated. Dominion is known for using its political influence to shape legislative outcomes, as illustrated by a series of bills that gave Dominion outsized power to raise electricity rates, skirt regulation, and charge customers for excess profits. But a recent wave of utility reform legislation restored base rate-setting authority to the SCC, a power that was previously stripped from the commission in 2015 legislation.

Dominion has pumped over $2.1 million into Virginia’s Attorney General race this year, the most the utility has ever spent on a Virginia race, according to an analysis of state campaign finance filings by the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI).

This election cycle, Dominion hedged its bets for AG and split the record-breaking $2.1 million among two candidates, one on each side of the aisle, to oppose a vocal Dominion critic, former Delegate Jay Jones. Dominion backed the current AG Republican Miyares, and a Democratic challenger to Jones, Shannon Taylor. Dominion poured $775,000 into the Taylor’s campaign. Jones, who prevailed in the Democratic primary against Taylor, advanced to the general election against Miyares. In an opinion essay, Jones called for “a democratized energy system” that is no longer “overwhelmingly dictated by … monopoly utilities, resulting in laws that too often favor utility profit at the expense of the public interest.”

Jones received an endorsement and $325,000 in campaign contributions from Clean Virginia, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Clean Virginia was established to challenge Dominion’s political influence in the state. The group said “Jones [has] taken a principled stance against accepting donations from publicly regulated utility monopolies,” along with Democratic candidate for Governor Abigail Spanberger.

Spanberger’s opponent, Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, accepts contributions from regulated utilities, and has received $200,000 from Dominion in support of her effort to keep her party in the Governor’s mansion. Not all Republicans are following Earle-Sears’ lead, however. Eight Republicans running for re-election this year broke from Dominion despite previously accepting the utility’s money, according to EPI’s analysis of state campaign finance filings.

Republican delegates Lee Ware, Carrie Coyner, Mike Cherry, and Amanda Batten collectively accepted over $220,000 from Dominion since 2021, but now refuse even a cent from any utility monopolies regulated by the SCC, according to a statement from Clean Virginia.

When asked by EPI why Ware stopped accepting Dominion money, Ware’s counsel shared an email that Ware’s political action committee had sent in May, 2024 to a Dominion representative, stating “Friends of Lee Ware has decided, and pledged, no longer to request or to accept donations from Dominion Energy or its subsidiaries,” along with a Virginia Scope article detailing Ware’s 2022 legislative attempt to ban campaign political contributions from public utility companies, like Dominion.

Ware represents part of Chesterfield County, where Dominion—through its allied pro-utility front group Power for Tomorrow—is fighting widespread public opposition to a highly contested methane gas plant it claims is “critical” to meeting data center demand. Ware shares the district with Del. Coyner, who faces a rematch from four years ago when she takes on Democratic challenger Lindsey Dougherty in Tuesday’s general election. Dougherty, who opposes the plant, argued it “would hurt our air, our water, and our wallets, while doing nothing to solve our long-term energy needs.”

Senator Ghazala Hashmi, also a representative of the county, has led 19 other Virginia legislators in urging the Department of Environmental Quality and the SCC to deny the plant’s approval.

China has recently made several bold and unexpected moves related to its trade relations with the United States and India and at the WTO.

These actions suggest that China may be shifting to a more assertive posture in defending its economic interests abroad and shaping the terms of global trade.

They also point to a possible future in which China’s influence and power in the international system is linked to its dominant position in clean energy industries.

In the last six weeks, the Chinese government has made several bold moves related to its trade relations. First, on September 23, Chinese Premier Li Qiang made a surprise announcement that Beijing would no longer seek the “special and differential treatment” privileges (SDT) afforded to developing countries within the WTO system. Then, on October 9, China’s Ministry of Commerce published stringent export controls on rare earth materials and battery manufacturing equipment. Finally, on October 15, China’s WTO delegation initiated a dispute against India over the latter country’s efforts to boost domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and advanced chemistry cell batteries.

These developments may seem unrelated. But all three are a notable departure from China’s usual low profile relative to other economic heavyweights in shaping global trade conditions. Taken together, they signal that China may be shifting to a more assertive posture in defending its economic interests abroad and shaping the terms of global trade. Thus far, the strongest evidence for this shift relates to Beijing’s engagement on an issue that has been a recurring source of tension with its trading partners: clean energy.

Keeping a (relatively) low profile

China’s rapid transformation into the world’s largest exporter following its accession to the WTO, even as it maintained comparatively high barriers on its own economy, has given Beijing a natural interest in maintaining the status quo in the global trade system. Unlike the United States, China is not wielding tariffs coercively in a bid to overturn established trade norms. Unlike the European Union, it is not leveraging its market power to strengthen its trading partners’ labor and environmental standards. Instead, China has primarily focused on building a network of free trade agreements to complement its unrivaled overseas investment footprint.

At the WTO, China has generally taken a more pragmatic approach to its diplomacy than other influential developing economies, such as by joining plurilateral initiatives like the Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Agreement (MPIA) and the Trade and Environmental Sustainability Structured Discussions (TESSD). Although Beijing has been involved in many trade controversies, it is usually in a reactive capacity—that is, as a respondent or third party in a WTO dispute or in response to tariffs and countervailing duties that other governments have imposed on Chinese goods.

A shift in strategic posture

In this context, Beijing’s recent moves are significant, but not necessarily for the reasons one might assume. Li’s announcement about SDT is not a major shift in Beijing’s negotiating position. China has routinely declined developing-country privileges at the WTO and the announcement simply codifies this practice into policy. Likewise, China has on many previous occasions imposed export restrictions on rare earths and other mineral elements. China’s dispute with India, meanwhile, mirrors an earlier challenge it brought against the United States related to subsidies established under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The significance of these moves is instead in their scope and message, which suggest a shift in strategic posture. Li’s SDT announcement, for example, criticized “unilateralism and protectionism” and warned against “decoupling, severing supply chains, and bloc confrontation.” Li also remarked that China would “continue to promote the green transition” and “shoulder its due responsibilities” to contribute to global development. He drew special attention to China’s role in global clean energy supply chains, observing that it had reduced the costs of both solar and wind energy generation and “carried out green energy cooperation projects with over 100 countries and regions.” These remarks drew an implicit contrast with the Trump administration, which has rejected multilateral cooperation on trade and pressured other countries to buy US oil and gas products.

Washington has for many years been a staunch critic of SDT privileges in the WTO system, particularly for China. By defusing this critique and presenting itself as a fair minded, generous, and collaborative international partner, Beijing is positioning itself for a more prominent role in global governance and burnishing its credentials as a champion of multilateral institutions. In this sense, Li’s remarks dovetailed with another high-profile Chinese policy shift announced in September: the launch of the Global Governance Initiative, which seeks to redefine international cooperation and rule setting under the aegis of “new multilateralism” in opposition to US “hegemonic thinking.”

If Beijing’s pivot on SDT reflects a new appetite to revive and reform multilateral institutions, its other recent moves send a less cooperative message. Its latest export controls, which build on earlier restrictions imposed in response to the Trump administration’s “Liberation Day” tariffs and appear to be a direct response to a US Commerce Department rulemaking that expanded the number of Chinese or Chinese-linked firms subject to US export restrictions, are significantly stricter and broader than previous controls. Indeed, they pose a grave threat to multiple US industries. The controls were reportedly designed to give Beijing powerful leverage in future trade negotiations with the Trump administration; according to President Trump, China has agreed to suspend the controls for a year as part of a larger deal negotiated between Trump and Xi Jinping on October 30.

China’s dispute at the WTO, meanwhile, targets subsidies and other incentives designed to attract investment to battery and electric vehicle manufacturing in India under the broader “Make in India” campaign launched in 2014. China’s claim is notable in two respects. First, it contests India’s use of industrial policy tools to expand domestic production of clean energy technologies, despite China’s well-documented record of deploying subsidies and domestic content requirements on a far larger scale to support Chinese manufacturing of these same goods. Second, it marks the first time China has initiated a dispute against a country with a lower level of economic development than its own. SDT privileges have been a key component of India’s negotiation strategy at the WTO and New Delhi has strongly opposed reforming WTO rules related to SDT; even before China initiated its dispute, Indian commentators had observed that China’s decision not to seek SDT privileges would put greater scrutiny on this strategy.

Mixed messages, or a turn to green power competition?

At first glance, China’s recent moves may appear to send conflicting signals. On the one hand, Beijing is relinquishing a favorable negotiating position at the WTO with the stated purpose of working arm-in-arm with other countries to reinvigorate international institutions and enable broad deployment of clean energy technologies. On the other hand, it is weaponizing its monopoly on key inputs into clean energy supply chains to inflict pain on a geopolitical rival and contesting a fellow developing country’s green industrial policies.

But these two positions may not be as irreconcilable as they seem. They both point to a vision of China’s role in global affairs in which Chinese dominance of clean energy industries provides both an instrument of and justification for Chinese power and influence. More specifically, China would serve as a benefactor of other countries’ decarbonization and sustainable development ambitions, even if doing so requires undercutting their efforts to build alternatives to Chinese products and investment. In confronting competitors and adversaries seeking to decouple themselves to some extent from Chinese supply chains, Beijing appears willing to risk tensions with other Global South governments and leverage its control of critical chokepoints of global trade, which are primarily clustered in the clean energy sector.",https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image_How-Chinas-New-Trade-Assertiveness-Is-Linked-to-Its-Clean-Energy-Dominance.png,N,,2025-10-31 17:18:22.257626

In an era defined by digital transformation and geopolitical uncertainty, Canada through its G7 Presidency, is leading work with trusted international partners to strengthen supply chains, reduce dependencies and ensure access to the resources essential for clean energy, advanced manufacturing and defence.

Today, on the margins of the G7 Energy and Environment Ministers’ Meeting in Toronto, the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, along with G7 and industry partners, announced the first round of strategic projects and measures under the Critical Minerals Production Alliance to accelerate the development of secure critical minerals supply chains.

The Critical Minerals Production Alliance leverages sovereign tools to operationalize projects that will strengthen global critical minerals supply chains. By working together, the Alliance will bring critical mineral projects into production with high standards that drive economic growth and protect national security.

Minister Hodgson announced 26 new investments, partnerships and measures to accelerate and unlock $6.4 billion of critical minerals projects. These include:

Mobilizing public and private capital to accelerate critical mineral projects, including for graphite, rare earth elements and scandium production.

Securing offtake arrangements and co-investments in partnership with nine allied countries and industry partners from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Norway, the United States, Australia and Ukraine.

Entering offtake arrangements between the Government of Canada and Nouveau Monde Graphite and Rio Tinto for graphite and scandium, respectively.

Releasing the Roadmap to Promote Standards-Based Markets for Critical Minerals, a key deliverable under the G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan (CMAP), as a direct followup to the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Kananaskis, Alberta.

Canada’s collaboration with international partners reinforces the country’s reputation as a place to do business, strengthens its position as a trusted supplier and encourages greater investment in Canadian mining and processing projects. As part of the G7 CMAP, Minister Hodgson also highlighted up to $20.2 million in support of projects developed in collaboration with international partners to advance innovation in critical minerals research and development.

To further safeguard Canada’s national security and sovereignty, the Government of Canada intends to leverage the Defence Production Act to stockpile critical minerals in order to:

Strengthen domestic capabilities in strategic sectors critical to national defence;

Mobilize and protect domestic production and ensure secure supply to Canadian and allied defence industries;

Support Arctic sovereignty and domestic and collective stockpiling efforts with trusted partners; and

Advance the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) deterrence and defence goals by expanding transatlantic capacity.

The Critical Minerals Production Alliance stands as proof that the G7 can work together to develop critical minerals supply chains in a time of growing competition and evolving geopolitical context.

In advance of key events such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) 2026 Ministerial Meeting and the 2026 Prospectors and Developers Annual Conference (PDAC), Canada will continue to take the necessary steps — in close collaboration with G7 and other like-minded countries — to diversify, strengthen and secure critical minerals supply chains to ensure a safe and prosperous future for all Canadians.",https://www.canada.ca/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-31 17:18:25.200238

Baker Hughes said this week’s decline puts the total rig count down 39 rigs, or 7% below this time last year.

It said oil rigs fell by six to 414 this week, their lowest level since September, while gas rigs rose by four to 125, their highest since August 2023.

FIRMS SHIFT FOCUS AMID LOWER ENERGY PRICES

In Texas, the biggest oil and gas producing state, the rig count fell by one to 235, the lowest since September 2021. In Louisiana, meanwhile, the rig count rose by one to 41, the highest since September 2024.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

The independent exploration and production (E&P) companies tracked by U.S. financial services firm TD Cowen said they planned to cut capital expenditures by around 3% in 2025 from levels seen in 2024.

That compares with roughly flat year-over-year spending in 2024, increases of 27% in 2023, 40% in 2022, and 4% in 2021.

US EIA PROJECTED HIGHER OUTPUT

Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third year in a row in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to around 13.5 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, EIA projected a 56% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020.

EIA projected gas output would rise to 107.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

New report from Climate Power reveals that Trump’s war on clean energy has canceled or delayed 158,000 clean energy jobs

Washington, D.C. – Days before voters head to the polls in elections where energy costs have taken center stage, a new report from Climate Power details the impacts of Trump’s self-inflicted energy crisis. Climate Power’s Energy Crisis Snapshot shows over 158,000 jobs have already been lost or stalled in the clean energy sector, and gas and electric utilities have raised or sought to increase bills by at least $89.9 billion since Trump took office.

In a letter to the Trump administration calling out Trump for raising energy costs across the country, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) highlighted the job losses and canceled projects detailed in Climate Power’s report. The findings come as voters increasingly cite energy affordability as a top concern, with 57% of registered voters saying that rising electricity prices are having an impact on their personal finances. Each month, as American families face higher utility bills, Trump and Republicans are making the affordability crisis even worse by canceling clean energy projects that would have brought more energy to the grid.

“Donald Trump promised to lower costs – but instead, he’s making Americans’ lives more expensive, plain and simple,” said New York Governor Kathy Hochul. “He claims he wants energy independence and then launches a full-on assault on clean energy, blocking the very projects that would make power more affordable and increase supply. He imposed reckless tariffs that are driving up the costs of new energy projects or killing them outright, costing our state thousands of jobs. While Trump and his D.C. enablers put American families last, spineless New York Republicans are falling in line instead of fighting for the New Yorkers who put them in office in the first place. We may not agree on everything, but we should all agree on this: the cost of living is too high, and we need more energy, more jobs, and lower bills – now.”

“Trump is taking a sledgehammer to American clean energy manufacturing, and American families are paying the price. More clean energy means lower electricity bills – it’s supply and demand 101 – but Trump’s extreme agenda is taking cheap, reliable energy off the grid at the same time that demand is skyrocketing,” said Climate Power Executive Director Lori Lodes. “Americans face an affordability crisis that Trump and Republicans are making even worse with their war on clean energy. We need more energy, now, and by taking the cheapest energy we have off the table, Trump is directly raising Americans’ utility costs. Next week, voters in Virginia, New Jersey, and Georgia have an opportunity to bring their power to the polls and hold Trump and Republicans accountable for making life more expensive.”

With the 2025 elections days away, the report reveals that Virginia, New Jersey, and Georgia had some of the highest impacts from Trump’s war on clean energy:

The report’s findings include:

Household electric bills are up 11% nationally since Trump took office, and are poised to spike even further. In July 2025, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans passed the GOP budget bill. This bill is raising utility costs and destroying jobs by removing cheaper, cleaner energy sources from the grid, while funding new tax breaks for the oil and gas industries. Donald Trump and Republicans are accelerating their self-inflicted energy crisis, sending utility costs through the roof, closing down factories, and making us more dependent on foreign oil, all while dramatically increasing the pollution of our air and water.

But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.","KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn’t buy an EV. That’s significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That’s a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans’ anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that’s long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut’s state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He’s taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

In a letter to Administrator Lee Zeldin, the lawmakers also urged the EPA to reallocate 100% of the waived gallons from any granted Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) and to finalize the rule swiftly to ensure farmers and biofuel producers don’t lose out.

“At a time when farm families and rural communities face tough markets and economic uncertainty, we appreciate EPA’s recognition of the vital role American biofuels and agriculture play in lowering fuel prices and advancing American energy dominance. The proposed volumes in the Set 2 rule represent a meaningful commitment to supporting cheaper homegrown fuels, farm income, and rural economies. These volumes matter —not just to biofuel producers, but to the farmers who grow the corn, soybeans, and other feedstocks that power this economy, and to every American who enjoys lower prices at the pump because of biofuels. A strong RVO means stronger commodity prices, more stable markets, and greater opportunity for rural America,” the lawmakers wrote.

“As EPA considers its supplemental proposal, we urge the agency to fully reallocate 100% of the waived gallons for compliance years 2023–2025. Without full restoration the benefits of the original proposal won’t reach the farm gate or lower prices at the pump. Farmers and rural businesses will ultimately bear the brunt of weakened demand and lower prices,” the lawmakers continued.

Background:

In April, Ernst urged the EPA to restore integrity, stability, and growth to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) by raising Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) levels for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels. Following the EPA’s June announcement for getting the RFS back on track, Ernst praised the Trump administration for proposing record biofuel volumes, adding domestic feedstock protections, and reversing the Biden-era electric vehicle (EV) mandate – putting America’s farmers and rural communities first.

She also helped introduce the Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act, which she successfully included in the One Big Beautiful Bill to extend the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and ensure domestic feedstocks are prioritized for biofuel production – opening new markets for farmers.

More broadly, Ernst has been a leading advocate for homegrown Iowa biofuels, securing access to E15 for the summer driving months and pushing for permanent, nationwide availability that would give consumers, farmers, and biofuel producers the certainty they deserve.

They’ve squared up against the Stop Offshore Wind coalition, sponsored by the Town of Ocean City, Worcester County and business groups from the beach town.
Let me say it again: Offshore wind means lower utility bills,” Olszewski said.
The Trump administration began by halting the issuance of any new offshore wind leases off the coast of the United States.
It wasn’t enough for them to stop offshore wind leases,” said Maryland Del.","Advocates and lawmakers gathered in Baltimore on Friday to punch back at President Donald Trump’s assault on offshore wind projects, including one planned for Maryland’s coast.

Until Friday, the battle had largely played out in warring court documents traded between the Trump administration and US Wind, the company behind the proposal for up to 121 turbines off the coast of Ocean City.

In September, Trump’s Department of the Interior told a federal judge that it plans to revoke a critical federal permit issued to the US Wind project in the dying days of President Joe Biden’s administration.

The permit had been challenged by the Town of Ocean City, which welcomed the permit reversal. But the judge is still considering the government’s request, which has been ardently opposed by US Wind.

The event in Baltimore was the first of several “Yes to Wind” events planned for states across the country, and attracted two Maryland Democrats: U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Rep. Johnny Olszewski.

“What you’re seeing here is people power. Because what you’re seeing from President Trump in the White House right now is a tip of the hat to the Big Oil guys,” Van Hollen said. “They don’t like the competition.”

Earlier this year, a coalition of Maryland climate groups, labor unions and renewable energy advocates joined to form the Offshore Wind Alliance. They’ve squared up against the Stop Offshore Wind coalition, sponsored by the Town of Ocean City, Worcester County and business groups from the beach town.

But not everyone on Maryland’s Eastern Shore opposes the project, said Jared Schablein, chairman of the civic organization Shore Progress.

“This project injects new life into our local workforce by bringing real jobs, real investment and real hope into my community,” Schablein said. “It’s about making sure the next generation of shore kids don’t have to move away to find opportunities.”

Much of the messaging on Friday was focused on the economics behind the wind project, with supporters arguing that the project will lower utility bills by bolstering power supply.

“Offshore wind means lower utility bills. Let me say it again: Offshore wind means lower utility bills,” Olszewski said. “Blocking these projects will not lower costs, it will raise them.”

The project’s opponents have argued that, in addition to hurting Ocean City tourism and coastal fisheries, the project will raise power bills, partly because of construction costs.

Paul Pinsky, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, said it’s possible that the wind farm could cause a “blip” for ratepayers, but urged Marylanders to take a long-term view of the project’s economics.

“With many of these energy projects, whether it’s rooftop solar or offshore wind, there’s an upfront cost, but it can get recovered fairly quickly, and once it’s recovered, the price drops considerably,” Pinsky said.

A January study from the Energy Administration indicated that Maryland is “below trajectory to meet its existing clean energy targets, in particular those renewable targets set for 2030.” The state has an overall goal of reaching 100% carbon-free energy by 2035.

The Trump administration began by halting the issuance of any new offshore wind leases off the coast of the United States. But the administration has since begun targeting projects that already received federal approval — and in some cases, had already started construction, unlike Maryland’s project.

The Trump administration has issued “stop work” orders to Empire Wind in New York (which was rescinded after negotiations with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul) and to Revolution Wind in Rhode Island (which was overturned by a federal judge).

In Maryland, the administration requested to revoke the project’s approval, citing a need to review impacts on coastal fisheries and search-and-rescue efforts in the area.

“It wasn’t enough to raise taxes on clean energy. It wasn’t enough for them to stop offshore wind leases,” said Maryland Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery). “They had to actually do stop work orders on projects that were 80% complete, because that’s how much their billionaire fossil fuel buddies are threatened by offshore wind.”

The administration also rescinded $679 million in grant funding for port projects in the U.S., including some tied to offshore wind manufacturing. That included $47.4 million bound for the Sparrows Point Steel turbine manufacturing hub planned for Baltimore County.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a news release at the time.

“This is an administration that has explicitly gone after clean energy projects in Democratic-led states and Democratic-led districts,” Olszewski said. “That is not who we are as Americans. We are better than that.”

Friday’s news conference was held at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 24 office in Baltimore, which also includes a training center for future electricians.

The center trains about 600 apprentices each year, said Rico Albacarys, political director for the union. In high-voltage training courses taught toward the end of apprentices’ four years of study, the students work on the types of thick cables that run through wind turbines, Albacarys said.

To work on building Maryland’s first offshore wind farm, though, electricians will need a special certification that isn’t offered at the center on Patapsco Avenue in West Baltimore.

Called global wind organization training, the certification costs about $2,000 per person, and it only lasts for two years, Albacarys said. So the Trump administration’s efforts to slow the US Wind project have made it more difficult for the union to plan when it will train its members, Albacarys said.

“We’re trying to thread the needle,” Albacarys said. “We don’t want to start training them too early [so] that they have to get recertified before they actually are able to work on the turbines.”

Regardless of the recent obstacles, Albacarys said he’s confident that Maryland will eventually gain a wind farm on its Atlantic coast.

“It’s only a matter of time,” Albacarys said. “I know it doesn’t feel that way right now, but I think 20 years from now, we’re looking back at: ‘Oh, remember that speed bump?’”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9238-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-10-31 17:18:28.277476

A decision to keep the power plant open would mark a new flashpoint between Colorado and the federal government.
Campbell power plant in Michigan, warning the loss would lead to blackouts.
A controversial legal strategy to keep coal plants running Hurd’s letter asks Wright to invoke Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.
“DOE actions to prevent coal plants from retiring will increase costs and make electricity less affordable,” Gerhart said.","Congressman Jeff Hurd sent a letter on Friday asking the Trump administration to indefinitely delay the closure of Comanche 2, a coal-fired power plant currently scheduled to shut down at the end of 2025.

Pueblo is home to two operational coal-fired power plants run by Xcel Energy: Comanche 2, slated to close in December, and Comanche 3, a consistently unreliable plant scheduled to shutter by 2031. Comanche 1, an older unit built in 1973, ended operations in 2022.

Hurd’s letter asks Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive from Colorado — to invoke federal emergency powers to keep the lights on at the entire Comanche Generating Station, until certain the utility installs enough generation to replace it. In an interview with CPR News, Hurd, who represents Pueblo, said that the one-two punch of closing Comanche 2 and 3 would create a crisis when demand for power is spiking, driven by data centers used for AI.

“Fundamentally, I think this is an issue of grid stability, which goes beyond the state borders of Colorado,” Hurd said.

A decision to keep the power plant open would mark a new flashpoint between Colorado and the federal government. Colorado utilities have spent years working with state regulators on plans to shutter all six coal-fired power plants across the state by 2031.

It’s clear, however, that the Trump administration is ready to override state authority. In May, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright delayed the closing date for the J.H. Campbell power plant in Michigan, warning the loss would lead to blackouts. Critics claim no emergency exists and ratepayers will end up paying millions to keep the facility on life support.

Hurd’s request faces immediate pushback

A similar fight could soon play out in Colorado.

Neither Xcel Energy nor state regulators have publicly sounded the alarm about an imminent grid reliability crisis that’d require Comanche 2 to stay open. Environmental groups claim the federal government is ready to invent one in order to buoy the coal industry.

‘This is a manufactured crisis,” said Erin Overturf, the clean energy director for Western Resource Advocates. “If we are in a so-called energy emergency, then why is the Trump administration bending over backwards to slow procurement of clean energy resources like wind, solar and battery resources?”

Overturf also worries that extending Comanche’s lifespan would increase energy bills. In Michigan, the utility operating the J.H. Compbell power plant recently reported it’s spent around $615,000 per day to keep the facility running, adding up to $80 million in net costs since May. Customers will eventually pay some of those costs.

Utilities have also guaranteed closing coal fire power plants would save money in Colorado. Xcel Energy announced plans to close Comanche Unit 1 and Comanche Unit 2 in 2017. At the time, Colorado’s largest utility claimed retiring both coal-fired power plants would help protect the environment and save ratepayers $213 million money over the long run.

State utility regulators at the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) unanimously approved the plan in 2018. Roughly four years later, the same panel of regulators approved a settlement to shutter Comanche 3 by 2031.

The PUC and Xcel Energy have also spent years deliberating how to replace Comanche 3. The current plan calls for a massive build out of new renewables and payments to Pueblo County to compensate for tax revenue lost by shuttering the complex.

Some local officials have called on the federal government to interfere, arguing that only new natural gas power plants or even nuclear facilities could offer sufficient jobs and property taxes.

In a written statement, Will Toor, the director of the Colorado Energy Office, said Gov. Polis’ administration is ready to talk to local officials about the best ways to protect air quality and low energy prices

“At the same time, it’s important to point out that wind and solar are cheaper for consumers than expensive and often unreliable coal-fired generation, and utility resource planning is subject to state – not federal – jurisdiction,” Toor said.

Hurd, however, said the state has failed to account for potential grid reliability issues. Comanche 3 — Colorado’s newest coal plant — has been full or partially offline for more than 138 days since August 2023, according to documents obtained by the outlet Big Pivots. With so many outages, Hurd said Colorado can’t afford to shut down Comanche 2, which he claimed provides a consistent source of baseload power.

In a statement, Xcel Energy said it would comply with any orders issued by the federal government to keep its coal plants running.

The U.S. Department of Energy did not reply to a request for comment.

A controversial legal strategy to keep coal plants running

Hurd’s letter asks Wright to invoke Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.

The law allows the federal government to order power plants to stay open during emergencies — like during times of war, in the aftermath of disasters or when there’s a shortage of electricity.

The Trump administration has already invoked the law to keep the lights on at the Michigan plant, and another one in Pennsylvania.

The Sierra Club has challenged the Michigan orders in federal court. Matt Gerhart, a staff attorney for the environmental group, said it’s currently monitoring the possibility of a similar order to continue operations at the Comanche Generating Station.

As US Wind awaits a variety of legal decisions, the Trump administration continues its fight against offshore wind projects across the coast.","Top Maryland Democrats are coming out in full force to support a massive offshore wind project currently tied up in federal court.

Baltimore-based US Wind has faced an onslaught of challenges in recent months keeping the company from starting construction on a 114-turbine wind farm off the coast of Ocean City, which is estimated to generate enough power for 718,000 Maryland homes.

In October 2024, the Town of Ocean City and numerous plaintiffs representing the fishing and tourism industry filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), challenging the federal permit approval process for US Wind’s project.

This September, the Trump administration asked the court to vacate the project’s Construction and Operations Plan — approved under the Biden administration — and send it back to BOEM for reevaluation, signaling plans to reverse approvals of the necessary permits.

If the court approves such a move, Ocean City’s lawsuit could become moot.

US Wind filed a crossclaim, arguing the federal government’s intent to ""vacate and undermine the federal approvals” are tied to “a wider plan to hinder or kill outright offshore wind projects for political purposes.”

Earlier this month, US Wind also filed for a preliminary injunction to prevent the federal government from revoking the permits, arguing such a move could bankrupt the company.

The Trump administration’s attempt to revoke the permits follows a federal executive order signed in January that directs agencies to review previously approved offshore wind projects and temporarily halt all offshore wind energy leasing within the Offshore Continental Shelf.

Friday, Maryland U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Jonny Olszewski joined the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 24 in showing support for US Wind’s project.

While the Trump administration argues the permits were granted without properly weighing environmental and commercial impacts, Van Hollen believes the opposition comes down to fossil fuel interests.

“What you're seeing from President Trump in the White House right now is a tip of the hat to the Big Oil guys. They don't like the competition from clean energy, including offshore energy,” Van Hollen said.

Olszewski raised concerns over what revoking those permits and ultimately delaying or canceling the project could have on the region’s economy and energy crisis.

“Pulling the plug on offshore wind is a direct assault on American jobs. It's an attack on our national energy security, and it's an assault on the affordability that Maryland families and American families need so desperately right now,” the congressman said.

Maryland has set an ambitious target of 8,500 megawatts of offshore wind energy generation by 2031 — US Wind’s project could help accomplish roughly a quarter of those generation goals.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown also reiterated support for the project Wednesday, filing an amicus brief advocating for the approval of US Wind’s request for a preliminary injunction.

“Maryland has spent years building our offshore wind future, but the Trump administration's actions threaten that progress and the thousands of jobs this project would create,"" Brown said in a statement. “We're filing this brief to defend critical investments in Maryland communities, good-paying jobs for Marylanders, and the clean energy our families need as electricity demand and utility costs continue rising.""

The Trump administration dealt another blow to US Wind back in August when it cancelled $679 million for offshore wind projects.

The funding withdrawal did not cut money allocated for the project directly but instead revoked a federal grant that was intended to fund construction for the new steel fabrication facility Sparrows Point Steel.

The proposed long-term monopile production facility at Sparrows Point in Baltimore would be specifically equipped for producing materials for the Maryland offshore wind project.

Despite losing the grant, US Wind says it will continue to move forward with the $400 million facility.

The future of the project also rests in the hands of the Delaware Superior Court, where US Wind is appealing a decision from a county council to deny a permit needed to build an electrical substation in Delaware where the generated power would connect to the regional grid.

Ocean City is also challenging an air pollution permit tied to the project issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment.

Investing in abundant, American-made clean energy is not merely an economic or environmental choice, but a core national-security imperative.
This administration talks about “American energy dominance” and “energy security” as pillars of national strength.
Clean energy is not the enemy of energy security; it is a central component of it, and veterans are core to the workforce building that capability.","Tens of thousands of American veterans wake up every morning to go to work in the solar and storage industry. They are construction workers, project managers, and electricians that are continuing their service by building the infrastructure that powers our lives.

Veterans make up 8.2% of the U.S. solar workforce, significantly higher than their share of the national labor force. As Washington continues its seemingly daily attacks on clean energy, the truth is that those attacks are disproportionately hurting veterans.

I’m proud to be one of 23,000 veterans working in the solar and storage industry, but my journey here was not smooth. I was an Infantry Officer in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2015 to 2021, and one of 6,000 veterans fired in DOGE cuts. In the months that followed, I’ve watched as Washington has systematically attacked our industry in favor of their preferred energy sources.

This Veterans Day, honoring service shouldn’t be rhetorical. If we truly want to value those who served, let’s align our policy with that promise. We can start by building the industries that secure our energy future while preserving the livelihoods of the veterans who build them.

Cancelled projects and broad cuts to federal clean energy programs don’t fall evenly across the economy. They land hardest in an industry where veterans make up a larger share of the workforce. Add that to the thousands of veterans laid off due to federal staffing cuts, and the result is clear: more veterans are out of work and more military families will lose paychecks due to the Administration’s attacks on the solar and storage industry.

Princeton’s ZERO Lab and other studies estimate a roughly $500 billion reduction in clean energy investment through 2035, and Energy Innovation projects up to 760,000 U.S. jobs could be lost by 2030. Because veterans are represented in the clean energy workforce at roughly double their share of the overall U.S. workforce, those modeling projections imply 68,400–76,000 veterans could be affected.

According to SEIA and Wood Mackenzie forecasts, the Trump administration’s anti-clean energy policies could cause the U.S. to lose up to 125 gigawatts of solar deployment between 2025 and 2030. This represents a significant hit to future hiring and manufacturing that will further depress opportunities for veterans in the sector.

The consequences of this administration’s anti-solar policies reach far beyond jobs. Veterans bring mission discipline and leadership to these projects that strengthen America’s energy infrastructure. When we push veterans out of these roles, we don’t just drive-up unemployment data, we hollow out teams that deliver energy security.

Energy security in 2025 means building resilient, homegrown energy systems that can stand up to supply shocks, extreme weather, and interference from hostile actors. But moving away from domestic clean energy and deepening reliance on imported fuel sources creates vulnerability at the hands of foreign suppliers. Look no further than Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which demonstrated how quickly a geopolitical shock can trigger a global energy crisis. Solar has zero fuel cost and much lower price volatility. Investing in abundant, American-made clean energy is not merely an economic or environmental choice, but a core national-security imperative.

The irony is sharp. This administration talks about “American energy dominance” and “energy security” as pillars of national strength. Yet policies that undercut clean energy deployment and simultaneously place tens of thousands of veterans out of work actively weaken our national security. Clean energy is not the enemy of energy security; it is a central component of it, and veterans are core to the workforce building that capability.

We must do better. If we really mean “thank you for your service,” let’s act like it. Lawmakers should protect the domestic clean energy industries that employ and empower veterans. That means sustaining stable, long-term policy signals that attract investment, expanding programs like Solar Ready Vets, and ensuring that veterans have clear, well-supported pathways into solar, storage, and related trades.

Nearly 23,000 American veterans choose to keep serving in solar and storage. The least we can do is make sure our policy choices don’t force them out of the work they’re doing for their country.

Three industry leaders bring their respective expertise to the table.

Woodcliff Lake, NJ – October 31, 2025… Since 2022, the BMW Group and Solid Power, Inc. (Nasdaq: SLDP) have intensified their activities for the development of all-solid-state battery (ASSB) technology through their technology transfer agreement. The latest milestone was the integration of Solid Power’s large-format pure ASSB cells into a BMW i7 technology test vehicle.

As of October 2025, Samsung SDI joins the efforts to pursue development and validation of the ASSB technology in the automotive field. The new collaboration marks a key step towards ASSB technology, bringing together the complementary expertise of three industry leaders.

Under this arrangement, Solid Power will supply sulfide-based solid electrolyte to Samsung SDI, which Samsung SDI will integrate into separator and/or catholyte and use to build cells, in each case subject to achievement of technical requirements.

These cells will be evaluated based on performance parameters and requirements to be agreed between Samsung SDI and BMW Group. Ultimately, Solid Power, Samsung SDI, and BMW aim to develop and supply ASSB cells for integration into a next generation of evaluation vehicles.

“We are excited to partner with Samsung SDI and BMW to progress the development of all-solid-state batteries,” said John Van Scoter, President and CEO of Solid Power. “Our solid electrolyte technology is designed for stability and conductivity, and by working closely with global leaders in automotive and battery innovation, we strive to bring ASSB technology closer to widespread adoption.”

""Technological competitiveness in batteries would ultimately lead to innovation in electric vehicles,"" said Stella Joo-Young Go, Executive Vice President of ASSB Commercialization Team at Samsung SDI. ""Samsung SDI will work closely with great global partners like BMW and Solid Power to take the lead in commercializing ASSB.""

Martin Schuster, Vice President Battery Cell and Cell Module at the BMW Group, says: “With Samsung SDI joining our partnership with Solid Power, we gain significant momentum on our path advancing the development of new battery cell technologies. This global collaboration is another proof point of our overarching goal: to be always in a position to offer our customers state of the art battery technology.”

The partners believe in the potential of genuine ASSB technology, and the promise of higher energy density combined with increased safety compared to today’s technologies by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid materials.

With increased energy density, longer vehicle ranges can be achieved without having to accept disadvantages in terms of weight of the overall storage system.

The BMW Group and Solid Power have been cooperating since 2016 through an extended “Joint Development Agreement,” which was supported by a BMW Group investment in Solid Power in May 2021 as part of a financing round.

At the end of 2022, BMW and Solid Power agreed to further deepen their partnership. BMW will operate a solid-state cell prototype line at the CMCC in Parsdorf, on the basis of a research and development license and with Solid Power's experience and expertise.

Since 2008, the BMW Group has been consistently building up its competence in the field of battery cell technology. Since 2019, this know-how has been pooled at the BMW Group's Battery Cell Competence Center (BCCC) in Munich. The BCCC covers the entire value chain, from research and development to battery cell design to producibility.

In order to be able to quickly and efficiently implement innovations in the field of battery cell technology, the BMW Group cooperates in a network of around 300 partners, including established companies, start-ups and universities, among others.

The BMW Group's battery strategy - to operate on equal footing with industry's leading cell manufacturers through deep know-how - has proven its worth.

Labor unions and business groups hailed the approval.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a federal permit Wednesday to Enbridge for its proposed Line 5 reroute around the Bad River tribe‘s reservation. The company is proposing a $450 million plan to build a new 41-mile segment of the oil and gas pipeline after the tribe sued Enbridge in 2019 to shut down and remove Line 5 from its lands.

That permitting decision comes as the federal government remains shut down, and no documents were made available by the agency in its decision.

Environmental groups Midwest Environmental Advocates and Clean Wisconsin say it’s too soon to issue a permit, calling the agency’s decision “unlawful.” Tony Wilkin Gibart, MEA executive director, criticized the Army Corps for issuing the permit to a foreign company without releasing its details to the public. He added that legal action by the tribe and groups to block state permits for the project remain ongoing.

“It’s a violation of federal law for the Army Corps to grant these permits before a final state water quality certification,” Wilkin Gibart told WPR.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources issued the certification last year, but Wilkin Gibart said it’s not final under Wisconsin law due to the ongoing challenge. Groups stress construction can’t begin until the contested case hearing challenging state permits for the project is resolved. A decision is still pending as groups prepare final briefs in the case.

Enbridge spokesperson Juli Kellner said in a statement that the company expects a decision on the challenge by the end of the year.

“We’re confident state permits will soon be confirmed,” Kellner said. “Once that occurs, Enbridge expects the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Proffered Permit to be signed and finalized, allowing construction to move forward.”

The project would cross close to 200 waterways and affect around 101 acres of wetlands in Ashland and Iron counties. Construction would include blasting bedrock and drilling in waterways and wetlands upstream from the reservation and internationally recognized wild rice beds.

Bad River Tribal Chair Robert Blanchard didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Gussie Lord, an Earthjustice attorney representing the tribe, called the Army’s decision shortsighted.

“We think it’s really important to protect the Great Lakes for future generations. We know that wetland ecosystems work to provide habitat and protect the watershed and protect homes from flooding,” Lord said. “(Line 5) is an aging piece of infrastructure. It’s outlived its useful life, and it doesn’t belong running through the heart of the greatest freshwater system in North America.”

Supporters of the project, including labor unions and farm groups, said the Army Corps permit is a key milestone for Line 5, which carries up to 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids daily. They’ve touted the 700 jobs that would be created through the project and its roughly $135 million economic impact, including Corey Gall, president of the Wisconsin Pipe Trades Association.

“By our nature, we go from job to job and follow the work, so they’re not temporary jobs. They’re careers,” Gall said. “Many of these men and women who work these pipeline jobs often travel far from home (and) out-of-state. It would be great to have another project within our state that would keep all these folks working close to home.”

He estimated 300 or more pipeline welders or workers in Wisconsin may be working on the project during peak construction. Groups like the Dairy Business Association thanked the Corps for its decision, saying they feared price hikes or a propane shortage if Line 5 were shut down.

The Army Corps of Engineers had been reviewing Enbridge’s application for a permit under the Clean Water Act since 2020. A Corps official said the decision Wednesday would advance President Donald Trump’s energy agenda.

For the first time in nearly five years, voters will decide two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, the powerful utility regulator that controls electricity rates and energy policy statewide.

The commission has gained increased attention as Georgia Power, the state’s largest electric utility with 2.8 million customers, is requesting approval for 10,000 megawatts of new power generation capacity over the next five years.

That demand comes largely from Georgia’s surging data center development, with metro Atlanta becoming the fastest growing market for server farms in the U.S. But the data center boom, driven by the rapid of artificial intelligence and information technology, has raised concerns about the amount of land and energy the complexes consume.

Critics say the costs to power them are falling on Georgia residents and local businesses. Data centers use 10 to 50 times as much energy as a typical office building with the same square footage, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

All that has created a window of opportunity for local Democrats seeking to bring change to the all-Republican commission. The body faces criticism for approving six utility rate hikes since late 2022, increasing the average Georgia Power residential customer’s monthly bill by about $43.

“There are already multiple plans to set up data centers in Georgia, and we’ve seen ample evidence that we could be the ones covering the bill,” said Navy Eger, a 30-year-old Georgia resident. “My hope is that by adding two Democrats to the commission, we stand more of a chance of pushback on these reckless proposals.”

In May, Georgia Power struck a deal with the five commissioners to keep its current base rates in place through 2028.

That rate freeze was touted by Commission Vice Chair Tim Echols.

As he fights to retain his position, he says keeping Georgia’s energy rates low is his top priority.

“Electing Tim Echols again gives you a steady hand at the Public Service Commission in keeping Georgia at the forefront of business in America,” Echols said. “I have moved Georgia into seventh place for installed solar, built the only nuclear energy plant to be completed in 36 years and frozen Georgia Power’s base rates for three years.”

Echols was an unwavering supporter of Plant Vogtle, Georgia’s four-unit nuclear power plant. He said he would like to see the construction of more large nuclear reactors, which are among the safest modes of electricity generation.

Serving on the commission since 2011, the incumbent Republican is now up for reelection.

He faces a new Democratic challenger in his district — Alicia Johnson.

Johnson said she wants to fight against unjust rate increases, advocate for ratepayer protections and push for bolder investment in clean, affordable energy solutions like solar and wind.

She says she wants to hold Georgia Power accountable for its requested increases and ensure they are not overestimating how much power they actually need.

Besides data centers, the company has also been criticized for its use of “trade secret” designations and redacted information in submissions to the commission. One vocal critic, Patty Durand, was arrested last week after she took a booklet labeled “Georgia Power Trade Secrets” during a commission hearing.

Also fueling Democratic engagement: concerns about climate change and support for clean energy.

Last year, renewable resources accounted for 12% of Georgia’s total in-state electricity generation, mostly from solar energy and biomass from wood, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

And yet also last year, the commission green-lit new gas-fired turbines. Earlier this year, they approved a Georgia Power plan to keep coal plants open past their previously approved retirement dates.

In District Three, which includes most of the southern suburbs of Atlanta, incumbent Republican Fitz Johnson is trying to fend off a challenge from Democrat Peter Hubbard.

It will be the first time the Army veteran and businessman faces voters after he was appointed by Republican Governor Brian Kemp in 2021 to replace former commissioner Chuck Eaton, who became a state judge.

Although Johnson voted to allow Georgia Power to push most of $10 billion in costs from the over-budget expansion of Plant Vogtle to the company’s ratepayers, he has blamed the rate increases on inflation and pointed to higher costs in Democratic-led states like California.

“When liberals in Washington tried to force their woke Green New Deal on Georgia and cost our families and crush our businesses, Fitz stood up for ratepayers and stopped their agenda at the state line,” Johnson’s campaign site states.

Hubbard, on the other hand, is a renewable energy advocate. While the solar developer and consultant has not held public office before, he is a familiar face at the commission, having testified in several Georgia Power cases representing his nonprofit, the Georgia Center for Energy Solutions.

With 15 years of experience developing electric utility “Integrated Resource Plans,” Hubbard says he has already prepared ones that prioritize lowering power bills through investments in low-cost and highly reliable solar, battery storage, virtual power plants and energy efficiency.

Against that backdrop, residents of some Georgia cities are also voting on city council and board of education seats.

Some are even choosing a mayor. That includes in Marietta, where 24-year-old Democrat Sam Foster is attempting to become its youngest and first Black chief executive. Foster has garnered wide support from the city’s young adults and Democratic community as he tries to unseat Steve Tumlin, a 78-year-old Republican who has held the position for 15 years.

“We need new blood in the area,” said Morgan Younce, a 33-year-old Marietta resident. “Tumlin is holding back progress and represents old Marietta.”

In Atlanta, the state’s capital and most populous city, Democrat Andre Dickens is attempting to win a second term as mayor. He says his four years in office have reduced violent crime and increased affordable housing units. He faces three challengers: Helmut Domagalski, a corporate consultant; Kalema Jackson, a former Atlanta police officer; and Eddie Meredith, a community advocate.

Over 500,000 voters turned out for early voting ahead of election day on Tuesday, according to the Secretary of State’s Office.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/10/sam-foster-mayor-marietta.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-31 17:18:41.531424

The project is meant to move over 1.5 million dekatherms per day of gas and is the largest expansion of gas infrastructure currently proposed in the Southeast. The assessment claims to analyze the environmental impacts of the SSEP’s multiple sections of pipeline, massive gas compressor station expansions and additional infrastructure modifications.

With the release of the assessment, FERC has announced a 30-day comment period, closing on Dec. 1. There have been no FERC public hearings for residents along the route thus far (only scoping meetings where people were required to give comments in private rooms), and the agency is not planning any during this comment period. This project impacts five states, and such a massive project warrants meaningful public participation from those along the impacted route.

FERC’s assessment arrives near the end of a Virginia Department of Environmental Quality public comment period for the SSEP, as a Virginia Water Protection Permit and Upland Certification are being considered through Nov. 10 as part of a Clean Water Act 401 permit review.

Adding to the significant concern about the SSEP’s impacts, Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC plans to build an extension of its pipeline, called “Southgate.” The SSEP and Southgate share similar routes through Pittsylvania County, Virginia, and Rockingham County, North Carolina, causing deep concern for local residents. The co-location of two high-pressure, large-diameter pipelines that cross the same waterways could mean cumulative, devastating impacts for local communities, species and water resources.

Southgate is currently undergoing a simultaneous permitting process, with FERC reviewing an amendment request to change the route, diameter and capacity through Nov. 3, and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality undergoing a Clean Water Act 401 permit review through Dec. 5. The pipeline companies have bickered publicly about their access to the area and the need for both pipelines. The Environmental Assessment for Southgate concluded that SSEP could eliminate any need for Southgate.

“More than 90% of the gas from SSEP would go to utility companies across the Southeast for proposed gas plants that carry a lot of uncertainty,” said Juhi Modi, North Carolina Field Coordinator at Appalachian Voices. “Forecasts of energy demand in the Southeast are likely overestimates driven by data centers and other large-load customers that may never materialize. But residential ratepayers would end up on the hook paying for this massive expansion of pipelines and gas plants, no matter what.”

“SSEP would go through communities in North Carolina that already suffer from some of the worst air pollution in the state — communities that have already voiced strong and unified opposition to this project,” said Caroline Hansley, Campaign Organizing Strategist at Sierra Club. “As FERC continues to ignore the impacts on those communities, it’s now more important than ever that local entities and elected officials stand up for their neighbors and oppose SSEP. We are committed to fighting SSEP alongside the impacted communities for as long as it takes.”

“It is absurd for the FERC staff to assert that this huge, destructive project would have ‘no significant impact’ on the precious environments and the people whose lives would be profoundly harmed,” said David Sligh, Wild Virginia’s Water Quality Programs Director. “FERC must complete a full Environmental Impact Statement, disclose the true impacts, and reject this proposal. That’s the only way the commission can meet its duty to protect the public interest.”

“We’re a month into the federal government shutdown, but business as usual continues for the fossil fuel polluters,” said Russell Chisholm, Managing Director of the POWHR Coalition. “Home energy costs keep going up with no relief in sight for communities just trying to survive, never mind keeping up with multiple permits for pipelines on top of pipelines.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-31 16:19:34.995294

We urge the EPA to withdraw this proposed rule and instead strengthen efforts to monitor GHG emissions from all sources, including the industrial sector.","On October 29, Woodwell Climate submitted public comment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed amendments to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).

Woodwell Climate Research Center (Woodwell) strongly opposes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed rule to remove reporting obligations of 46 source categories for the industrial sector under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).1

Woodwell has conducted research on the dangers that greenhouse gases (GHG) pose to human life, property, and the environment since our founding in 1985. In 1986, Dr. George Woodwell, our founder and namesake, testified in the first congressional hearing on climate change.2 In his testimony, he warned his audience of future dangers of increasing emissions, including biological amplification, or the ways in which increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere creates a positive feedback system leading to further increases in emissions.

Woodwell values data transparency and recognizes public reporting programs as essential infrastructure for sound scientific practice and informed policy-making. Transparency is not merely a procedural virtue but a foundational principle of good science because it allows for peer review, reproducibility, and the collective advancement of knowledge that occurs when various experts can examine the same information. The GHGRP exemplifies this principle by making facility-level emissions data publicly available. An informed public is better equipped to participate meaningfully in democratic processes, to advocate for their health and safety, and to support policies grounded in empirical reality. By dismantling

this reporting infrastructure, the EPA would undermine scientific integrity and diminish American citizens’ ability to engage on matters directly related to their health and wellbeing.

Scientific Foundation and EPA’s Flawed Rationale for Rescission

Originally established in 2009, the GHGRP, under the Clean Air Act (CAA), required that the largest industrial emitters reported their emissions annually.3 EPA cited two sections of the CAA that provided authority to create the GHGRP, Sections 114 and 208. Section 114(a)(1) provides the basis for the EPA to require the monitoring and reporting of emissions, and section 208 provides EPA with the authority regarding motor vehicles and their engines.

Since then, the GHGRP has been used for monitoring emissions from 47 source categories, across 8,000 facilities in the United States.4 Efforts support our understanding of climate change as well as air quality, without such monitoring it will be difficult to track progress, or lack of progress, towards reducing emissions and may worsen health outcomes.5

Based on two broad sets of rationales, the EPA proposes to eliminate most of the GHGRP, removing reporting requirements for all source categories except petroleum and natural gas systems (Subpart W), which would be suspended until 2034. Under the proposed rule, EPA argues that Section 114 does not provide authority to collect GHGRP data because the reporting requirements do not serve an underlying statutory purpose under CAA. Specifically, EPA argues that Section 114 requires a greater connection between the continuous regulation obligation and a statutory purpose.6 Moreover, the agency argues that the elimination of most of the GHGRP will not disrupt its ability to meet provisions under the CAA and will not have any harm on human health or the environment.7 Such a claim ignores the substantial and mounting evidence that climate change and associated pollution significantly affect the health and welfare of American communities.

Health and Welfare Consequences

When established, the GHGRP was based upon a strong scientific foundation. Since the establishment of the GHGRP, the science supporting the effects of GHG emissions on public health and welfare has grown stronger, making accurate emissions monitoring more important than ever.

In 2023, the Fifth National Climate Assessment comprehensively assessed the current and future risks to the United States of GHG-induced climate change, including extensive evidence for public health impacts. The authors report existing harm to human health across the U.S. that is only expected to worsen with continued warming. The assessment documents compounding health hazards including: “More severe and frequent extreme events; Wider distribution of infections and vector-borne pathogens; Air quality worsened by smog, wildfire smoke, dust, and increased pollen; and threats to food and water security.”8 Rather than responding to this mounting evidence by strengthening emissions monitoring, the EPA proposes to eliminate the very reporting infrastructure needed to track and address these emission sources.

Threats to public health and welfare are further documented by international scientific assessments. The IPCC, established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), reviews existing scientific research on climate change and produces Assessment Reports that synthesize that knowledge. The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report draws upon peer-reviewed scientific literature to conclude with high confidence that climate change has already resulted in “destruction of homes and infrastructure, and loss of property and income, human health and food security.”9 The report documents observed impacts including “Infectious diseases; Displacement; Mental health; Heat, malnutrition and harm from wildfire”10 as widespread and substantial consequences of GHG emissions around the world. The IPCC specifically examines North America, finding with very high confidence that rising temperatures are projected to increase heat-related mortality across all emission scenarios this century, and that smoke from intensified wildfire activity is associated with respiratory distress, with impacts persisting long distances from wildfires and beyond initial high-exposure periods, further underscoring the urgency of maintaining comprehensive emissions data.11

The strengthened scientific evidence cited above makes clear that the GHGRP serves a vital public health function. Accurate emissions data enables researchers, policymakers, and communities to identify pollution sources, track trends, and develop targeted interventions to protect public health. Eliminating reporting requirements would create blind spots in our understanding of emissions sources at the same time as the health consequences of GHG emissions are becoming more severe and better documented.

Case Study: Air Quality & Monitoring

Woodwell’s research demonstrates the connection between air quality and climate change. Exposure to pollutants, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter (PM), are contributors to a range of health issues.12 For example, PMs are microscopic particles that can penetrate deep into the body, exacerbating heart and lung disease, cancer, and cognitive problems.13,14 Scientists have also found long-term exposure to these pollutants can reduce life expectancy.15 These pollutants are often produced by the burning of fossil fuels, which also emits GHG emissions that drive climate warming. Climate change worsens pollution exposures by trapping pollutants in the atmosphere for longer periods of time, thereby increasing exposure durations and concentrations.16

In September 2025, the EPA released a report that found that intermittent air monitoring has adverse effects. Specifically, when air quality monitoring was offline for certain sites, those same sites saw a significant increase in air pollution levels.17 This report is consistent with what other scientists have found with intermittent monitoring of environmental standards and is known as the pollution gap.18 The pollution gap may lead to higher than allowable and unhealthy exposure, putting American communities at risk. The elimination of most of the GHGRP will only increase this threat.

Conclusion

The overwhelming scientific evidence is clear: GHG emissions pose a serious threat to public health and welfare that demands action, monitoring these emissions are essential for such action. Rescinding the GHGRP reporting obligation would be deeply contrary to the robust scientific evidence for the current and future harms to public health and welfare resulting from unfettered GHG emissions. Doing so would abandon America’s responsibility to protect its citizens and abdicate our leadership in addressing the defining challenge of our time. We urge the EPA to withdraw this proposed rule and instead strengthen efforts to monitor GHG emissions from all sources, including the industrial sector.",https://www.woodwellclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Woodwell_Favicon-150x150.png,N,,2025-10-31 17:05:49.729971

The deals were finalized during his October 2025 Asia tour. They aim to lower reliance on China, which leads to global production of these key materials.

Rare earth elements are vital for many things, including electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, smartphones, and defense systems.

Global demand is rising fast as countries invest more in clean energy and digital technologies. These new partnerships are among the biggest efforts yet to build alternative supply chains for critical minerals.

Japan Deal: Strengthening Industrial and Energy Security

On October 28, 2025, Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi signed a key deal. This agreement aims to secure supplies of rare earths, lithium, cobalt, and nickel. The agreement expands past U.S.–Japan cooperation and includes new plans for joint investments, technology sharing, and transparent supply management.

Under the deal, both countries plan to:

Build processing and refining plants for rare earths and battery minerals.

Create strategic stockpiles and improve recycling systems.

Support magnet production for EVs and defense industries.

Explore nuclear fuel supply cooperation for next-generation reactors.

Japan still relies on China for about 65% of its rare earth imports, even after years of trying to diversify. The new deal aims to cut this dependence by sourcing from U.S. allies like Australia and Vietnam. Also, it will process materials locally or in partner nations.

The plan supports Japan’s economic security law, which pushes companies to find new material sources. Tokyo has set aside about ¥400 billion (US$2.7 billion) in funding to help domestic rare earth and battery material projects through 2027.

Southeast Asia: Expanding the Network Beyond China

Trump also announced new cooperation deals with Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia. These countries hold key mineral reserves and play important roles in regional trade.

Malaysia already operates one of the world’s few large rare-earth processing plants outside China. Vietnam has about 22 million tonnes of rare-earth reserves, second only to China. Indonesia and Thailand are major producers of nickel and tin, vital for EV batteries.

The Southeast Asia deals aim to:

Bring in U.S. and Japanese investments for mining and refining projects.

Train local workers and improve technical skills.

Cut tariffs and export barriers that slow regional trade.

Support cleaner and safer mining technologies under ESG standards.

Experts say these efforts could create an “Indo-Pacific mineral corridor.” This would link mines in Australia, processors in Southeast Asia, and manufacturers in Japan. This network would help reduce China’s control over the middle stages of the supply chain.

Why Rare Earths Matter: A Market Under Strain

Rare earths are a group of 17 metals used in many high-tech and clean energy products. The most valuable are neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium. These elements are essential for strong magnets used in EV motors, drones, and wind turbines.

China controls around 60–70% of mining and 85–90% of refining for rare earths. This gives Beijing major influence over countries that depend on these materials.

In 2024, the world produced about 350,000 tonnes of rare earth materials. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects demand to reach over 500,000 tonnes by 2030. Market value could rise from $13 billion in 2024 to over $25 billion by 2030.

The U.S. currently makes about 12% of global rare earth ore, mostly from the Mountain Pass mine in California. However, much of it is still sent to China for processing. That dependence makes the new deals with Japan and Southeast Asia even more important.

Strategic and Economic Significance

For the United States, these deals mark a new stage in mineral diplomacy. Washington aims to safeguard clean energy and defense industries. It plans to do this by securing long-term supply agreements in Asia to help protect against disruptions.

Japan gains stronger support for its automotive, electronics, and robotics sectors. The country is restarting its rare earth recycling programs. These programs slowed down after Chinese export limits in 2010 made prices rise sharply.

For Southeast Asian nations, the agreements promise foreign investment, new jobs, and technology sharing. Malaysia and Vietnam might become key centers for refining and magnet production. This could create jobs for thousands of skilled workers.

The deals also back U.S. efforts to counter China’s export restrictions. In 2024, China limited exports of gallium, germanium, and certain rare earth magnets for “national security” reasons. Those actions disrupted supply chains and forced manufacturers in Japan, Europe, and the U.S. to look elsewhere for materials.

Rare Earth Market Outlook: Rising Demand, Tight Supply

Demand for rare earth magnets, especially neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, might triple by 2035. This rise is fueled by electric vehicles (EVs) and wind turbines. Each electric vehicle needs 1–2 kilograms of these magnets, while one offshore wind turbine can use up to 600 kilograms.

The price of neodymium oxide has climbed from about US$70 per kg in 2020 to more than US$120 per kg in 2025, showing strong pressure on supply. China’s quota limits and environmental checks have made availability uncertain.

The U.S., Japan, and the European Union are expanding recycling programs. They aim to recover rare earths from old motors and electronics. This helps reduce reliance on mined materials. Yet, recycling currently provides less than 5% of total global demand.

The Cost of Breaking Free from China

Building alternative supply chains is difficult. Several challenges include:

High costs: Rare-earth plants are expensive and take years to build.

Environmental risks: Poor waste management can pollute water and soil.

Financing issues: Price swings make investors cautious.

Geopolitical tensions: China may respond by lowering prices or tightening exports.

Experts say that without strong government support, new producers may not compete with China’s scale and low costs. Both the U.S. and Japan are studying tax credits and loan programs to help new projects move forward.

Forging a New Indo-Pacific Supply Chain

These rare earth agreements send a clear message: the U.S. and its allies want to reshape global supply chains around trusted partners. The next steps include choosing priority projects, securing funding, and coordinating trade rules.

If successful, these efforts could shift 15–20% of global refining capacity away from China by the early 2030s. That would mark the biggest industry shift in decades.

For the U.S., Japan, and Southeast Asia, the deals combine economic security, industrial growth, and clean energy goals. They also show how the energy transition and geopolitics are now closely linked.

These attributes also apply to its technical sibling, the EV3, which is very popular in South Korea and Europe.

The South Korean carmaker had originally announced a US market launch for the electric hatchback saloon. The model even celebrated its North American debut at the New York Auto Show in April. But since then, market conditions in the United States have changed fundamentally.

Firstly, there are President Trump’s punitive tariffs – since the EV4 fastback is manufactured in South Korea, unlike the European hatchback, imported vehicles are subject to tariffs of 15 per cent. Donald Trump originally wanted to impose a 25 per cent tariff on South Korean EV imports, but the two countries agreed on a reduction at the end of July as part of a trade agreement.

Nevertheless, the vehicle would become significantly more expensive for US customers than had been expected before the change of government. Under the Biden administration, the KORUS Free Trade Agreement, which came into force in 2012, still applied. This provided for duty-free access for Korean passenger cars to the US market.

The end of subsidies is hampering demand

US tax credits for electric cars expired on 30 September. It is still too early for concrete figures, but the cancellation of this government subsidy is likely to result in a significant cooling of the market for fully electric vehicles. Before the end of the programme, there was another rush for pure electric cars, which is why many interested parties are likely to be served for the first time.

In light of these developments, the US market launch of the EV4 is no longer a priority for Kia. It is quite possible that the electric sedan will never find its way to American customers. A spokesperson for the company confirmed this decision to InsideEVs: “However, as market conditions for EVs have changed, the release of the upcoming EV4 electric sedan will be delayed until further notice.”

The Tesla Model 3 competitor is by no means the only electric car that, contrary to original plans, will either not be launched in the United States at all or will be launched much later than expected. Volkswagen’s electric mid-range ID.7, for example, suffered a similar fate. The Nissan Ariya, which was already underperforming in the US, was dealt a fatal blow by Trump’s punitive tariffs on car imports from Japan. After only three years, the model is to be discontinued there.

Under different political conditions, the Kia EV4 Fastback would have had a good chance on the US market – the attractively priced sedan is positioned in one of the most popular segments, stands out visually from the crowd, offers a modern infotainment system and plenty of space, and is among the leaders in its segment in terms of range, with up to 633 kilometres according to WLTP.

It also offers a high level of comfort, as the hatchback version proved in our test drive report. These attributes also apply to its technical sibling, the EV3, which is very popular in South Korea and Europe. The compact SUV was also originally intended to be offered in the US, but Kia seems to have changed its mind about its US market launch.

In recent weeks, the university’s relationship with the Indiana Daily Student has been the subject of understandable concern and scrutiny. I want to speak directly to you — and to our broader community — about where things stand, what we have learned and how we move forward together.

First and foremost, let me reaffirm that our commitment to a free and independent student press has never wavered. More than a publication, the IDS represents a public trust and a cornerstone of Indiana University’s educational mission. For generations, it has embodied the ideals of free inquiry, open debate, and journalistic rigor. I view these as critical values for our campus, as does Dean Tolchinsky.

As you know, a personnel decision was made on our campus regarding a staff member engaged with the IDS. While the university cannot speak about the details of that decision, I will note that it coincided with a convergence of long-term operational concerns related to the Student Media Action Plan and my recognition that an annual deficit approaching $300,000 is not infinitely sustainable. It was within this context that I chose to halt campus support for print editions of the paper.

The juxtaposition of the personnel matter and the budget-related decision to pause printing of the IDS fueled a perception that editorial content drove the decision not to print.

Let me be clear: my decision had nothing to do with editorial content of the IDS. And contrary to what has been posted on social media and published, Indiana University has never attempted to censor editorial content, period. The IDS is, and remains, editorially independent.

But perception, even when it is not grounded in fact, can carry the weight of reality. I recognize and accept that the campus has not handled recent decisions as well as we should have. Communication was uneven and timing imperfect.

At the same time, my examination of the IDS’s history makes clear that the challenges we face today are not new. There has not been a sustainable model for decades, and the long-term financial viability of the IDS cannot be dismissed as trivial, especially in this resource-constrained environment. Put simply, the IDS is not immune to the financial realities of this campus and higher education more generally.

As we move forward, I want to reaffirm three key commitments:

1. Collaboration: We must ensure IDS leaders will have a seat at the table as we develop a plan for future operations.

2. Editorial independence: We defend and will continue to protect the integrity of student journalism as a core tenet of this university.

3. Preparation and support: We must continue providing resources and mentorship that equip student journalists to excel as media professionals, even as we balance essential financial stewardship.

We will continue to uphold a free and open press while responsibly stewarding public funds and families’ tuition dollars and further strengthening the learning experience for our students. That is my commitment.

Let’s take this moment as an opportunity to reset and reaffirm what unites us.

The Task Force on the Editorial Independence and Financial Sustainability of the IDS/Student Media provides us with this opportunity, a path forward to achieve clarity about a model that upholds our values and addresses decades-long financial challenges.

In advance of the task force’s work, I have authorized the financial office to allow the IDS, under the supervision of The Media School, to use their established budget through June 30, 2026, as the editors see fit — so long as they remain true to their budgetary parameters.

The IDS and the university share the same purpose: to serve truth, to educate with integrity and to prepare students for success in a contemporary media landscape.

In this moment, we have an obligation to write the next chapter of the Indiana Daily Student, one built on mutual respect, shared responsibility, and an enduring belief in the power of a free press.

Sincerely,",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ids/0151e02e-3b7a-40c8-b48f-a96ac74b0778.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&h=600,N,,2025-10-31 16:04:59.576931

Customers receive electricity from two aging, out-of-state coal plants that lose a lot of money.
A West Virginia Public Broadcasting story in September showed that Appalachian Power customers in West Virginia and Virginia paid for more than $328 million in losses at the two plants from 2018 to 2024.
She adapted her analysis to calculate how much Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia customers were overpaying for OVEC power versus what power from the market cost.
“Those commissioners are walking a political very fine line if they ever move to undo ties to coal plants,” she said.","Kentucky utility regulators could approve a rate increase for Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities customers. They’ve approved new power plants to meet the electricity demands of data centers. Customers may not have known about the hidden cost they’re paying for two coal plants.

In October, Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities and other parties came to an agreement in a case before the Kentucky Public Service Commission.

Under it, KU customers would pay $9 more a month on average, and LG&E customers would pay $5. The Kentucky commission would have to approve the pact.

The Kentucky PSC has approved a plan by the utilities to spend $3.7 billion on electricity generation projects, including two natural gas power plants costing a combined $2.8 billion.

Behind the rates paid by the companies’ customers is a hidden cost that doesn’t show up on their bills. Customers receive electricity from two aging, out-of-state coal plants that lose a lot of money.

Together, the utilities own a share of the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC).

OVEC has a plant in Madison, Indiana, across the Ohio River from Kentucky, and another in Cheshire, Ohio, across the river from West Virginia.

An analysis adapted from a case in Michigan shows that KU and LG&E customers have paid nearly $168 million in losses generated by the OVEC plants in the past seven years.

“That’s bad by any account, and definitely costing ratepayers as compared to what it would have cost them just to self produce their own energy,” said Byron Gary, program attorney for the Kentucky Resources Council.

A West Virginia Public Broadcasting story in September showed that Appalachian Power customers in West Virginia and Virginia paid for more than $328 million in losses at the two plants from 2018 to 2024. Mon Power customers in West Virginia have paid more than $10 million.

Indiana customers of two more utilities have paid a combined $167 million in losses. That breaks down to $136 million for Indiana-Michigan Power and $31 million for CenterPoint Energy.

Indiana-Michigan Power and Appalachian Power are subsidiaries of American Electric Power. AEP owns the biggest share of OVEC, at 39%.

Other states have walked away from the OVEC plants. Michigan regulators stopped Indiana-Michigan from charging Michigan customers for the OVEC losses. Ohio lawmakers repealed a scandal-tainted bailout of the plants.

“I think it is helpful to know that other states who are not embroiled in our historical ties to coal have already determined that they are not smart for the ratepayers in their states,” said Elisa Owen, Kentucky senior organizer for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign.

Indiana regulators decided over the summer that Indiana customers of Indiana-Michigan would pick up the losses no longer absorbed by Michigan customers.

Devi Glick, an energy analyst at Synapse Energy Economics, testified in the Michigan case.

She adapted her analysis to calculate how much Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia customers were overpaying for OVEC power versus what power from the market cost.

She said the structure of OVEC’s ownership makes it hard to change anything about the way the plants operate.

“If all of them got together and were saying, ‘Yeah, this is a bad idea,’ they could make a change,” Glick said, “but it’s kind of an a nice, easy way out for them to say, ‘oh, we can’t make a unilateral decision.’”

Liz Pratt, senior communications director for LG&E and KU, said she wasn’t familiar with Glick’s analysis and couldn’t comment on it.

“We dispatch least-cost generation first, and this balanced generation approach gives us the flexibility to hedge against fuel price increases for our customers, while continuing to ensure safe, reliable and affordable service,” she said, adding, “Our residential electric rates remain well below the national average.”

Nationwide, electric utilities are scrambling to meet the demand for power from data centers and advanced manufacturing.

Meanwhile, federal policy has shifted from favoring renewables to supporting fossil fuels, including coal. The Trump administration wants to prevent the retirement of coal plants, and has used its executive power to keep at least one plant on the grid after it was scheduled to shut down.

The price of electricity has risen faster than inflation. Data centers may be driving some of that. The price of natural gas has also gone up, leading to an increase in coal generation.

The contract the region’s utilities have with OVEC runs until 2040, and utility analysts don’t expect the plants to become profitable. The Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek plants were built in 1955, making them older than the average coal plant.

Gary, of the Kentucky Resources Council, said replacement parts for coal plants are getting scarce. No new coal plant has been built nationwide since 2013.

“Nobody wants to continue making parts for Oldsmobiles anymore if they’re not going to keep making Oldsmobiles, so the parts just aren’t available,” he said. “And that’s probably only going to get worse and worse.”

Coal generates 68% of Kentucky’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. While that’s far less than in the past, and lower than West Virginia’s 86%, the Republican legislative supermajority has made moves to prevent coal plants from retiring.

The Sierra Club’s Owen said that puts pressure on utility regulators, who are appointed by the governor but approved by the state Senate.

“Those commissioners are walking a political very fine line if they ever move to undo ties to coal plants,” she said. “Now, does it matter that they’re out of the state? I think it helps.”",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2603.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 15:00:46.792727

""The Trump Administration is doing everything in its power to urgently and permanently deliver the 100% solution to the Tijuana River Sewage Crisis that the residents of Southern California have demanded for decades,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said Thursday in a press release provided to Fox News Digital.

Sewage has been flowing into San Diego from across the border in Tijuana, Mexico, going back decades. The situation has been described as a crisis by local leaders and residents, as the sewage impacts the city's tourism and Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, where Navy SEALs train.

SEALs, who are required to spend hours in the ocean as part of their training, have reported serious illnesses from the contaminated water, including acute gastrointestinal illnesses.

The crisis is blamed on outdated wastewater infrastructure that was strained by the skyrocketing population in Tijuana, Mexico, which has increased by approximately 188% from 1990 to 2025 alone, according to figures compiled by the Mexican government and local universities.

The EPA announced Thursday that it completed a 100-day review of all projects associated with correcting the sewage crisis and wastewater infrastructure along the border, and found it had shaved the timeline of completion for two other projects by another nine months, meaning roughly 12 years in total construction time was cut from the project.

""Important new progress to report on the efforts to implement a permanent, 100% solution to end the decades long Tijuana River Sewage Crisis: Today, EPA is announcing a nine month total reduction in the timelines for two additional key projects on the Mexico side of the border: Rehabilitation of Pump Station 1 and reconstruction of the Tijuana River Gates,"" Zeldin posted to X of the announcement.

Cleaning up the Tijuana, Mexico, sewage crisis was among Zeldin's top priorities in the early months of his tenure as EPA chief, traveling to San Diego and Mexico in April to assess the situation and meet with local leaders.

Zeldin and his Mexican government counterpart, Secretary of the Environment and National Resources of Mexico Alicia Bárcena Ibarra, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in July that streamlined the two governments' efforts to correct the crisis.

The Memorandum of Understanding allows the Minute 328 agreement, which is a 2022 agreement between the U.S. and Mexico through the International Boundary and Water Commission to address the sewage crisis with 17 sanitation infrastructure projects.

“We appreciate the important step EPA is taking with this supplemental proposal to rectify and reallocate the impacts of SREs issued for the 2023 and 2024 RFS compliance years, as well as reallocation for SREs anticipated for 2025,” said ACE CEO Brian Jennings in written comments. “If the volumes of renewable fuel represented by the SREs are not reallocated, obligated parties could use the oversupply of low-priced RINs to satisfy future renewable volume obligations instead of buying and blending physical gallons of ethanol and other renewable fuel. This type of demand destruction would undermine the integrity of the RFS.”

ACE emphasized that history has shown how harmful SREs can be to ethanol demand. “SRE-induced demand destruction occurred in 2018 and 2019 when D6 RIN values cratered from $1.00 per gallon to $0.20 or less following EPA’s decision to grant 85 SREs covering the 2016 through 2018 compliance years,” Jennings noted. “More than 4 billion gallons of blending obligations were effectively erased for refiners through EPA’s action at that time, discouraging refiners from blending ethanol above E10 and restraining sales of E15, E30, and E85.”

Jennings said EPA has an opportunity to prevent that from happening again. “EPA must reallocate 100% of the 2023 through 2025 exempted RVOs – an estimated 2.18 billion gallons – to the final Set 2 rule. The 100% full reallocation approach is the only way to ensure blending obligations remain whole for 2026 and 2027.”

Beyond reallocation, ACE reiterated support for EPA’s proposal to set record-high renewable fuel volumes and encouraged EPA to consider conventional biofuel levels exceeding 15 billion gallons to offset potential export market losses and ensure conventional ethanol maintains its role in the fuel supply.

ACE’s comments also backed EPA’s proposal to reduce RIN generation for imported fuels and foreign feedstocks and called for improvements to the Agency’s lifecycle modeling for biofuels. “We encourage EPA to modify its methodology to align with real-world observations and actions taken by Congress, including use of GREET and GTAP-BIO modeling approaches,” Jennings said.

Nevada is known for its wide deserts and rich mining history. Today, it is earning a new reputation – as the center of America’s electric vehicle (EV) and battery revolution. The state now produces over 80% of all lithium mined in the U.S., and its output is growing fast.

Nevada’s lithium industry is vital to the nation’s clean-energy goals. In 2025, the state is expected to produce between 25,000 and 40,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), with production growing at an annual rate of about 40% as new projects begin operations. This growth is supported by a surge of new investment and innovation—from lithium mining to advanced battery manufacturing.

Lithium is at the core of this transformation. It is the key metal that powers EVs, grid batteries, and renewable energy systems. As global demand continues to soar, developing a steady domestic supply has become a top U.S. priority.

For the country, it is both an economic and an energy security issue. Nevada is becoming the cornerstone of that vision, with its mineral potential, strong infrastructure, and mining-friendly policies.

Growing Demand for Domestic Lithium

Global lithium demand is expanding rapidly. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects it will increase nearly fivefold by 2040, driven by the global shift to EVs and clean-energy storage. The world’s total known lithium resources now exceed 115 million tonnes, while the U.S. holds about 19 million tonnes—mostly in Nevada and California.

Even so, the U.S. still imports most of its lithium. Domestic production makes up less than 2% of global supply, leaving the country dependent on imports from Chile, Australia, and China. This creates major risks for automakers and energy companies that rely on steady, affordable lithium.

To meet its clean-energy goals, the U.S. must grow its domestic lithium base fast. Nevada’s large claystone and brine deposits make it the natural hub for that expansion. The state’s deposits are unique in both size and accessibility, giving it a strong edge in supplying the raw materials for EV batteries.

Introducing Surge Battery Metals and the Nevada North Lithium Project

At the center of this growth is Surge Battery Metals. The company’s main project, the Nevada North Lithium Project (NNLP) in Elko County, represents one of the highest-grade lithium clay deposits in the U.S.

According to its latest resource estimates, NNLP holds 11.2 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) at an average grade of 3,010 parts per million (ppm) lithium. This grade is higher than most comparable projects across North America.

Surge’s Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) highlights strong numbers:

Post-tax Net Present Value (NPV8): US$9.2 billion

Internal Rate of Return (IRR): 22.8%

Operating cost: US$5,097/t LCE

Mine life: 42 years

The project is located only 13 kilometers from major power lines and has all-season road access. It has received a Record of Decision and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), allowing expansion across 250 acres. With these clearances in place, Surge is years ahead of many early-stage lithium explorers.

Nevada’s Role in Building the U.S. EV Supply Chain

Nevada’s geography and infrastructure make it the ideal base for America’s EV supply chain. The state hosts both lithium claystone deposits in the north and brine basins in the south. This creates multiple sources for battery materials. It is also close to key automotive and battery hubs in California and Arizona, as well as Tesla’s Gigafactory in Sparks.

This location advantage saves both time and money. Lithium mined in Nevada can be refined, processed, and shipped to nearby gigafactories—all within a few hundred miles.

Compared with importing from overseas, this can reduce transport emissions by up to 70% and cut logistics costs significantly. The shorter distances also lower the carbon footprint of battery production, aligning with U.S. clean-energy policies.

Nevada’s mining and manufacturing sectors are now creating thousands of new jobs and drawing billions in private investment. Projects like the US$1 billion Lyten sulfur battery plant in Reno highlight how the state is becoming a full-scale clean-energy hub, from raw materials to finished batteries.

Surge Battery Metals fits right into this ecosystem. Its Nevada North project could provide the lithium feedstock for future gigafactories, supporting the U.S. plan to localize the entire EV battery supply chain—from mining and processing to assembly and recycling.

Strengthening U.S. Energy Security

By advancing NNLP, Surge Battery Metals directly supports national efforts to secure critical minerals. Producing high-grade lithium within U.S. borders reduces dependency on foreign supply chains and increases resilience against global market shocks.

Unlike imported materials that pass through multiple countries, lithium from Nevada can move straight from mine to factory under stable U.S. regulations. This local sourcing helps ensure long-term supply reliability for automakers while boosting domestic job creation.

Surge Battery Metals also follows environmental, social, and governance (ESG) best practices. Lithium clay mining uses less water and creates lower carbon emissions than many traditional methods.

The company plans to integrate water recycling and land reclamation into its operations to minimize impacts on nearby ecosystems. As environmental scrutiny grows, such responsible practices make projects like NNLP more attractive to both investors and manufacturers seeking sustainable materials.

Challenges, Opportunities, and the Road to EV Independence

Nevada’s lithium boom presents both opportunities and hurdles. Developers must continue working closely with local communities and regulators to manage water use and protect land resources.

Battery-grade lithium production requires careful processing, and achieving consistent 99.9% purity – a goal Surge is testing toward – takes time and investment.

Market volatility remains a factor. Lithium prices have been fluctuating. In 2025, it moved between US$8,300 and US$11,525 per tonne, reflecting tight supply and demand cycles. Yet analysts expect strong long-term growth as EV adoption continues worldwide.

Nevada’s emerging lithium industry offers a rare chance to strengthen U.S. energy independence while creating thousands of high-tech jobs. For investors, it represents both a challenge and an opportunity – a chance to help build a fully domestic clean energy economy.

The push for EV independence is about building cars as well as securing the materials that power them. Nevada is leading that effort, combining resource strength, infrastructure, and innovation.

Surge Battery Metals’ Nevada North Lithium Project embodies this shift. With a high-grade resource, strong economics, and a strategic Nevada location, the company is positioned to become a key supplier in America’s energy transition.

FastSites is designed to transform underutilized land and infrastructure into high-performance, investment-ready sites that attract new business and strengthen Louisiana’s long-term competitiveness.

Program Overview

FastSites represents one of the most aggressive site development efforts in Louisiana’s history. The program is structured to deliver measurable returns to the state through strategic infrastructure upgrades and accelerated project timelines. It empowers local and regional partners to prepare sites for immediate investment by reducing development barriers and aligning public infrastructure with private-sector momentum.

Key features of the program include:

$150 million in funding through the Site Investment and Infrastructure Improvement Fund

Statewide reach, targeting assets in every region of Louisiana

Competitive selection process focused on return on investment

Infrastructure improvements such as roads, utilities, and rail access

Support for public entities and qualifying private sites

Construction must begin within nine months of cooperative endeavor agreement execution, or as otherwise approved by LED

“This is one of the most forward-thinking site development models in the country,” said LED Chief Economic Competitiveness Officer Ileana Ledet, in a news release. “FastSites aligns government efficiency with private-sector speed, ensuring Louisiana can meet the demands of global investment while strengthening our communities and infrastructure.”

Who is Eligible for FastSites?

The program is open to:

Local or regional economic development groups

Cities and towns

Non-profits

Redevelopment authorities

Other public groups (e.g., parishes or districts)

Privately owned sites (with additional eligibility criteria)

Applications will be reviewed by both an internal committee and third-party experts.

The judges will evaluate applications based on key factors such as market demand, return on investment, community impact, site potential and alignment with public-private partnerships. Additional considerations include geographic diversity and support from local stakeholders.

Funding for these infrastructure projects can be structured as forgivable loans, performance-based partnerships, or infrastructure investments, allowing the state to adapt to each project’s strategic potential.

Strategic Impact

FastSites is designed to:

Reduce time, cost, and risk for incoming projects

Expand Louisiana’s inventory of development-ready properties

Attract global investment while delivering local benefits

Catalyze scalable growth through infrastructure modernization

The initiative reflects a new model of economic development, positioning Louisiana to compete globally while delivering tangible benefits to communities statewide.

Why it matters: The campaign that's filling your mailbox with pamphlets and your neighborhood's right-of-ways with yard signs is largely fueled by big corporate donors.

Driving the news: Mecklenburg County residents are voting on a 1% sales tax referendum this Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 4.

If passed, it would generate $19.4 billion over 30 years for various road, bike, pedestrian, bus and rail projects.

The combined sales tax rate in Mecklenburg County would rise from 7.25% to 8.25%.

The other side: Action NC is running the largest organized opposition to the tax, arguing it's ""regressive"" and will hurt low-income communities. The group tells Axios it's spent no more than $8,000 on its radio advertisements, text messages and 500 yard signs.

That's chump change compared with the $3 million that the Alliance has said it intends to raise, which has the backing of companies like Atrium Health, American Airlines and Coca-Cola Consolidated.

Follow the money: The biggest contributor, by far, is Atrium Health, chipping in $250,000 through at least Oct. 20, the end of the reporting period. Atrium Health CEO Gene Woods is a co-chair of the campaign.

The General Assembly has appointed the campaign's other chair, CLT Alliance's board chair David Longo, to serve on a 27-member transit authority that will oversee spending if the referendum passes.

Giving $105,000, the second most generous donor is HNTB, a national infrastructure firm that the city has contracted with on construction projects, including the Blue Line extension.

What they're saying: Matthew Panik, chief advocacy officer of the Alliance, told Axios in a statement that the high level of fundraising ""is a testament to the shared belief that Mecklenburg County must make bold investments in our region to ensure we can meet the challenges of the future.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), senior member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, joined U.S. Senator John Curtis (R-UT) to introduce the Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act.

The innovative bipartisan legislation would strengthen American competitiveness in fusion energy and secure domestic supply chains for high-tech fusion components. Companion legislation has been introduced in the House by Reps. Carol Miller (R-WV), Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), and Don Beyer (D-VA).

“The State of Washington is the world’s leading hub for fusion energy, which one day soon could provide vast amounts of the type of power we need to keep electricity prices down and increase America's economic competitiveness,” said Sen. Cantwell. “Providing tax incentives for fusion components will help ensure that the fusion supply chain also will be manufactured and create jobs in the Pacific Northwest.”

“Fusion energy represents the kind of bold, American innovation that built the West and can power our future,” said Sen. Curtis. “This bill ensures we’re not just competing in the fusion race, we’re winning it by manufacturing these critical components here at home, creating good-paying jobs, and securing our energy independence for the next century.”

The Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act would expand IRC Section 45X credit eligibility to include fusion components. Developed with feedback from industry partners, the bill defines components in the supply chain needed to bring the industry to scale. Examples include superconducting magnets, capacitors, fusion chambers, blanket systems, high-energy lasers, and essential materials.

Under the bill, each component would be eligible for a 25% tax credit through 2031, which would then be phased down through 2034.

“Workers are doing their part to hold this country together, our elbows are up, but they’re being squeezed from every direction,” said Bea Bruske, President of the Canadian Labour Congress. “This budget must invest in people and infrastructure”.

Bruske warned that balancing the books on the backs of working people would only deepen inequality and stall economic recovery.

“Any move to shore up Canada’s finances must be done fairly,” she said. “That means asking those who’ve made record profits and amassed the most wealth to pay their share—not cutting services or putting the squeeze on workers.”

Investing in people and communities

Canada’s unions are urging the federal government to launch a new wave of public investment focused on shovel-ready municipal and provincial projects—including housing, schools, transportation, public health, and child care.

“These investments must come with strings attached,” said Bruske. “They must create good union jobs, be community supporting, use Canadian procurement, and guarantee that the jobs stay in Canada for the long term.”

Budget 2025 should also build the next generation of public infrastructure including housing, transit and energy, expand early learning and child care, and make major investments in public health care, including pharmacare and safe long-term care.

“Blank cheques to corporations won’t solve the crises we face,” added Bruske. “Public dollars must deliver public good—good jobs, good wages, and the services working families rely on.”

Protecting jobs and preparing for the future

Canada’s unions are calling for a comprehensive job creation plan built around public infrastructure and a funded net-zero industrial strategy developed with unions. The plan should invest in clean energy, manufacturing, and retrofit programs while ensuring workers in high-emitting sectors can transition to new, secure, unionized jobs with fair wages and benefits.

To help workers through economic shocks, the government must also modernize Employment Insurance—restoring federal contributions, improving benefits, and lowering eligibility requirements—so that no worker falls through the cracks in the next downturn.

Fair taxation and fiscal responsibility

Bruske emphasized that real fiscal responsibility means ensuring everyone pays their fair share.

“Workers shouldn’t be asked to carry the burden of recovery while corporations hoard record profits,” she said.

Canada’s unions are calling for tax fairness measures, including:

Public country-by-country reporting for multinationals;

Maintaining the Digital Services Tax;

Increasing the capital gains inclusion rate;

Introducing wealth and windfall profit taxes; and

Investing in the Canada Revenue Agency to close loopholes and enforce compliance.

“When corporations and the wealthy pay what they owe,” said Bruske, “Canada can invest in housing, health care, and good jobs for everyone.”

Housing for everyone

The rising cost of homes and rents is taking a toll on workers whose wages are not keeping up. Workers want their government to make serious efforts to combat financial speculation in housing, starting with taxing house-flipping and vacant properties to capture windfall real estate gains that go to the wealthiest Canadians.

Canada’s unions are calling on the government to put in place ambitious and direct funding for the construction of new, non-market, affordable public housing, including social housing and co-ops for all, including Indigenous peoples, survivors of domestic violence, and people living with disabilities and particularly for marginalized groups.

Putting workers first

“Workers built this country, and workers will build the future,” said Bruske. “Budget 2025 must put people before profits—by investing in the infrastructure, jobs, and public services that make life more affordable and secure for everyone in Canada.”

Important note to investors regarding operating, reported earnings

Dominion Energy uses operating earnings (non-GAAP) as the primary performance measurement of its results for public communications with analysts and investors. Operating earnings are defined as reported earnings adjusted for certain items. Dominion Energy also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the Board of Directors, for the company’s incentive compensation plans, and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion Energy management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company’s fundamental earnings power. In providing its operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities, gains and losses on nuclear decommissioning trust funds, market-related impacts on pension and other postretirement benefit plans, acquisitions, divestitures, or extreme weather events and other natural disasters. At this time, Dominion Energy management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact of these items on future period reported earnings. Accordingly, Dominion Energy is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance.

Here are five elections where rising power bills, offshore wind, data centers, and the future of clean energy are all on the line.

Georgia Public Service Commission

Every state has an obscure regulatory body that oversees for-profit electric utilities, including their requests to raise rates and build new energy projects. In Georgia, it’s called the Public Service Commission, and unlike in most states, voters get to decide who’s on it.

Georgia’s current five utility commissioners — all Republicans — have been in power beyond their elected terms because lawsuits have delayed elections. On Tuesday, two of those commissioners will finally face voters.

In one race, Republican incumbent Tim Echols faces a challenge from Democrat Alicia Johnson. Echols calls for more nuclear power and battery storage and has touted his support for solar. Johnson wants more solar power and battery storage, including rooftop solar and other distributed energy resources, but is less bullish on nuclear.

In the other PSC race, Democrat Peter Hubbard is looking to unseat Republican incumbent Fitz Johnson (no relation to Alicia Johnson). Hubbard, an energy modeler, has a long track record of challenging the PSC, and told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John he’d push for more solar and less gas if elected. Johnson didn’t respond to Canary’s requests for comment, but has called this election a contest of ​“affordable, reliable energy vs. costly climate mandates.”

New Jersey governor

Democratic U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill is facing off against Republican former state legislator Jack Ciattarelli to lead New Jersey — and energy affordability has become a key issue. The state saw one of the country’s biggest electricity rate increases over the last year, and Sherrill has promised to build more clean energy generation to address the problem.

Ciattarelli, meanwhile, has blamed New Jersey’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for rising power prices. He’s also not a fan of offshore wind — just take a look at the koozies his campaign store is selling.

Virginia governor

Rising power bills are also a hot topic in Virginia, where Democratic former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger is facing Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the governor’s race.

Virginia is already known as the data-center capital of the world, and continued development could drive up power demand even further. Spanberger has called for exploring energy-efficiency programs and virtual power plants as potential solutions, and supports solar, offshore wind, and nuclear development to meet demand. Earle-Sears is more critical of solar and wind power, but is a strong supporter of small nuclear reactors.

New York City mayor

There’s a three-way race underway to lead New York City, where Democrat Zohran Mamdani is polling ahead of independent candidate Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

The future mayor will have a lot of say in implementation of the city’s landmark law requiring cuts in climate emissions from buildings, and Mamdani has promised to strictly enforce the measure. Mamdani has also woven climate action into his plans to make the city more affordable, including by turning dozens of schools into renewables-equipped resilience hubs.

Sliwa, for his part, has campaigned against battery storage development, and he celebrated when a major battery project planned for Staten Island was canceled this month. (More on that news below.)

A big week for conventional nuclear reactors

Small nuclear reactors may be generating more buzz, but conventional reactors are at the center of three big nuclear deals announced in the U.S. this past week. The first comes from the Trump administration, which announced an $80 million plan to work with nuclear reactor developer Westinghouse, Brookfield Asset Management, and uranium supplier Cameco to build several Westinghouse AP1000 reactors across the U.S.

In Iowa, Google announced it’s partnering with utility NextEra Energy to restart the Duane Arnold nuclear power plant. The facility has been shut down for five years, but Google hopes to get it back online by 2029 to help power its growing data-center fleet. And in South Carolina, state-owned utility Santee Cooper is tapping Brookfield Asset Management to finish construction of two AP1000 reactors that the utility abandoned back in 2018.

A win and a loss for battery storage

Large-scale battery development saw both a breakthrough and a setback over this past week. The good news for storage came from Form Energy, which has started installing its 100-hour iron-air batteries at a Great River Energy storage project in Minnesota. The startup is building those first-of-a-kind batteries at its West Virginia factory, where it hopes to speed up production as it works out some early kinks.

But on New York’s Staten Island, Fullmark Energy has withdrawn plans to build a 650-megawatt battery storage facility. The company didn’t give a reason for the termination, but it did face opposition from residents and local leaders.

Last week, the White House released a list of donors to a ballroom currently under construction where the East Wing once stood. One of those company names has a strong business presence in Jefferson and Gage counties.

NextEra Energy, Inc., is an American energy company that currently owns and operates the Steele Flats Wind Farm, which extends across portions of both counties. It is the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar.

The amounts donors contributed were not included but both individuals and corporations were listed, including such names as Union Pacific, Amazon, Google, Lochhead Martin and Hard Rock International. Donors have the option to remain anonymous, so the only names released were of those that agreed to be released.

NextEra’s support of the White House project might come as a surprise to some given President Trump’s openly hostile feeling toward wind energy. Trump called wind turbines “so pathetic and so bad” during his address to the United Nations General Assembly.

Nuclear Energy

However, NextEra does not just deal in wind and solar energy. NextEra also owns and operates plants that generate power using oil, natural gas and nuclear energy.

Nuclear energy in particular has been touted by many as the best solution to meet increasing demand for electricity as both AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cryptocurrency industries continue to expand, requiring more energy. A number of other donors to the ballroom construction are cryptocurrency or AI businesses.

On Tuesday, October 28, Google and NextEra jointly announced plans to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Linn County, Iowa. It was an Iowa only nuclear power plant and decommissioned in 2020. A press release issued by the companies cited AI as a motivation for the project, “As the U.S. enters a new era of innovation and opportunity driven by AI, this strategic collaboration aims to enable Google to grow its business needs responsibly.”",https://fairburyjournalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/the-white-house-269734_1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 14:07:02.031223

As we shift from using fossilised sunlight to real-time solar power, the challenge is no longer energy capture, but energy storage.","A self-reinforcing battery boom

We are in the midst of an electricity storage boom, with deployment nearly doubling every year. In 2024, developers deployed over 160 gigawatt-hours of new battery storage, which is nearly as much in one year as in all recorded history. As deployment scales, costs continue to fall; by as much as 40% last year. Recent tender results from China show turnkey costs for stationary storage around $60 per kilowatt-hour, with similar prices in India and Saudi Arabia, indicating prices continue to fall aggressively in 2025. That marks an order-of-magnitude drop compared with typical battery prices just seven years ago.

Battery storage quality has improved dramatically as well — with near “plug-and-play” grid systems cutting installation time and cost, longer lifetimes (some warrantied for as much as 20 years), minimal fire risk, and the rise of sodium-ion batteries that use no critical minerals.

A virtuous cycle has taken hold: lower costs lead to faster deployment, which in turn drives further cost reductions through learning and economies of scale.

This rapid progress has sparked a debate about how big storage could — or should — become. Many still seem to treat electricity storage as a completely novel challenge. It isn’t. The basic problem of how to store a valuable but perishable resource is one humanity has solved many times before.

The energy agricultural revolution

The shift to renewable energy is more than a technical upgrade; it marks a structural change in how societies generate and use energy. We call it the electrotech revolution. For centuries, humans have scoured the planet for fossil fuels, chasing energy across continents. Now we are learning to harvest it in place, from sunlight and wind, reliably and close to home.

There is a clear parallel with the agricultural revolution here. When early societies learned to farm, they began producing food in place — harvesting from the same fields again and again instead of chasing animals across vast territories. That shift unlocked far greater energy yields from the land, rising by roughly two orders of magnitude in most estimates. The result was abundance, settlement, and growth: the foundation of civilisation itself.

An analogous revolution is now underway in energy. By shifting from tracking down and collecting fossil fuels to farming sunshine, wind, water and heat from the ground, we are unlocking a resource base that is more local, steady and vastly larger: capable of supplying orders of magnitude more energy than fossil fuels — with every nation sitting atop renewable resources at least ten times, and for some a thousand times, greater than its demand. As renewable generation scales and electrification carries it through the economy, the age of electrotech marks a new period of energy abundance.

Key unlock for an agriculture revolution: storage

As the energy sector enters its own agricultural revolution, it faces a familiar challenge: how to plan for variable yields and preserve abundance through leaner periods.

Agriculture has always produced perishable goods, and storage has long been the key to transforming volatility into stability. Humanity has grappled with this problem for a very long time; in fact, it lies at the foundation of civilisation itself. More than 10,000 years ago, early societies began building granaries to hold surplus grain through leaner seasons; allowing for settlement and trade.

For millennia afterwards, inadequate storage forced farmers to sell harvests immediately, creating recurring cycles of glut and scarcity. Across global breadbaskets, grain and cereal prices collapsed at harvest and surged months later. Lacking reliable storage, farmers rushed goods to market, overloading transport routes such as shipping and rail networks. Only more advanced storage solutions that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century stabilised the market.

The same logic now applies to renewable electricity. Electricity is the ultimate perishable good; more so than grain, milk, or fruit, as it must be consumed within a fraction of a second. Producers race their output to market — literally at the speed of light — along copper wires, often oversupplying the system and driving curtailment and extreme price swings.

The rise of new electricity storage tech such as batteries addresses much of this challenge, just as previous storage technologies did. Grain silos stabilised harvests; refrigeration globalised fresh food. In every case, storage moved from rare and costly to cheap and ubiquitous. Electricity storage follows the same trajectory, turning the perishable into the persistent.

Comparing this revolution to earlier ones offers useful perspectives for a market still finding its shape. From this historic perspective, four broad takes emerge.

Take 1: Storage will probably be (much) bigger than we think

Seen through the lens of past storage revolutions, one thing becomes clear: forecasts almost certainly underestimate how large electricity storage will become. Most energy outlooks tend to only model the bare minimum needed to balance grids; typically 30–40 TWh globally in the long term. But this ignores two powerful forces: resilience and convenience.

No one ever calculated the cost optimal minimum size of fridge storage space the world required. Once refrigeration became affordable, businesses and households began purchasing their own units for greater flexibility and peace of mind, installing them throughout the supply chain — from farms and distribution centres to supermarkets and homes. The same logic will apply to batteries. As costs fall, they’ll appear everywhere: at solar farms, substations, businesses, and homes — not just where they’re strictly “needed.”

We may even put small batteries in most electrical appliances, from laundry machines to lightbulbs and cooktops — the “batterisation of everything” as energy analyst Gerard Reid calls it. If each device can run independently for a while, homes could smooth their own demand at an outlet-to-outlet level in real time, balancing loads not just across the grid but within the house itself.

Rough assumptions suggest how quickly this could scale. If utilities pair each kilowatt of solar with one or two kilowatt-hours of storage, grid operators install a few hours of storage at each substation, homeowners keep 20–30 kWh systems, and factories maintain a few dozen MWh for backup, the totals add up fast. Across roughly 20 TW solar, 500,000 substations, 3 billion households, and a million large factories, that comes to around 100–180 TWh of stationary storage globally in the long term— three to six times higher than current long-term forecasts. The manufacturing capacity to support this is already being put in place: global battery production is on track to reach twice even the most ambitious (net zero) IEA forecasts by 2030.

As with every previous storage revolution, the end state won’t be a bare-minimum system. It will reflect how people actually live: with buffers, redundancy, and a preference for autonomy.

Take 2: More storage means less transport

One overlooked consequence of storage revolutions is their impact on transport. Before refrigeration, fresh food had to reach markets every day, making supply chains fragile and inefficient. Cold storage changed that. Express “milk trains” once raced into cities like New York every morning to deliver dairy products before they spoiled, driving the construction of new rail lines built to handle that daily rush. When refrigeration spread, goods could be stored near supply centres and demand centres and shipped off-peak. The need for peak transport capacity fell, and much of that overbuilt network was gradually abandoned or repurposed.

Electricity is following a similar path. Today’s grid depends on long-distance transmission because supply needs to meet demand instantly or is lost. That means we build transport capacity to meet the highest peak loads, even though they occur for only a few hours per day or even per year. As storage expands, that urgency fades. Power can move in time, not just in space. Batteries, like cold storage a century ago, smooth the system; storing energy wherever it’s convenient, and allowing transport to spread into off-peak times.

Many grid plans still lag behind this reality. Much of today’s strategy assumes the old race to market: ever more transmission to chase supply in real time. Cheap batteries support a different model of a more distributed system where storage can often substitute for costly grid upgrades. Ignoring this is like building new rail lines in the 1920s to rush dairy products to New York while overlooking the arrival of refrigeration.

Local storage doesn’t just flatten peaks or defer investments; it also adds resilience to transport interruptions. Communities with their own batteries can ride through outages, much as towns with granaries once endured a failed harvest or an interrupted supply line.

Take 3: Storage and production help each other

A common critique of the storage boom is that it can’t last; that storage destroys its own market. The more storage you build, the less prices fluctuate, and the less profitable each storage project becomes. The same is said of solar: the more panels you install, the more oversupply and low prices you get when the sun is shining, and so the lower the revenues for all solar farms. Both arguments make sense in isolation, but together they don’t.

Storage and variable generation obey different economics. Production thrives on price stability; storage profits from volatility. That makes them natural complements.

The food storage analogy makes this easy to see. From the granaries of ancient Egypt to the imperial storehouses of China, societies have long used storage to tame production volatility. The 19th-century American Midwest offers a more recent illustration: as grain silos spread, farmers could hold back their crops rather than flooding the market at harvest, stabilising prices and improving profits. Stability made farming more attractive, drawing investment and expansion — which in turn made more storage worthwhile. Storage and production complemented each other to enable the Midwest’s grain and cereal boom.

The same feedback loop now shapes electricity. When solar expands, midday prices collapse, creating the arbitrage space that makes batteries profitable. Once built, those batteries flatten prices again, allowing even more solar to follow. Meanwhile, solar and batteries themselves continue to get cheaper as they scale, meaning they can thrive under progressively lower prices and thinner arbitrage opportunities. Storage and generation climb together; each expansion justifying the next. Just looking at storage or production economics in isolation seems to suggest cannibalisation; but in reality it is coordination between variable supply and storage.

Take 4: Storage will reset market dynamics

Many of today’s electricity markets trade in hourly and 15-minute intervals. That structure exists not due to preference but by necessity — supply and demand must match instantly because storage has long been scarce. As storage expands, that constraint will ease, and markets will evolve much as they did for other perishable goods.

Perishables like milk once had to be sold daily in market squares or delivered door-to-door for same-day consumption before they spoiled. Then cold storage came in which let shops and households stock food for days and weeks, turning daily markets into weekly shopping trips. Storage reset the cadence of the market from day-to-day to week-to-week.

Electricity will likely follow the same path. Once power can be stored for a few hours, trading shifts from minute-to-minute scarcity to buying the cheapest energy within that few-hour window. As storage grows, that time window — and with it, the structure of the market — widens. Markets that once cleared every hour will clear across days or even weeks instead, with prices reflecting time-shifting rather than instant balancing.

Emerging long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies will extend that logic further, much like freezing extends the life of food far beyond cooling. As LDES scales, the entire shape of the market can change from fast-cycling spot trades to slower, deeper cycles of accumulation and release, resembling today’s gas or grain markets more than the electricity systems of the past.

The path to energy abundance is paved with storage

We are entering an era of energy abundance. The sun delivers more energy to Earth every five days than all known fossil fuel reserves combined. As we shift from using fossilised sunlight to real-time solar power, the challenge is no longer energy capture, but energy storage.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1926227948.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 16:19:12.590557

And in the first month of the post-tax-credit future for EVs, that's exactly what happened. Both J.D. Power and S&P Global Mobility estimate that October's EV market share plummeted to around 5% in the U.S., from a record high of over 12% in September.

According to S&P Global Mobility, some 64,000 new electric vehicles were sold in October. That's a epic drop from September, when Americans bought or leased nearly 150,000 EVs as they scrambled to cash in on the expiring $7,500 incentive.

OUR MORNING NEWSLETTER IS ALMOST HERE!

Starting in November, Critical Materials will hit your inbox each morning at 8 a.m., delivering the latest EV news curated by our expert staff.

Plug-in hybrids got hit hard too, with their market share dropping from 2.2% in September to just 1% in October, per J.D. Power.

“The automotive industry is experiencing a significant recalibration in the electric vehicle segment in the first month following the expiration of the federal tax credits,"" said Tyson Jominy, J.D. Power's senior vice president of data and analytics.

You could say the EV market is coming to terms with a new reality for consumer demand—one in which electric cars are now unsubsidized, more expensive to buy and have to sell on merit alone. That may be part of what's going on here, and that's certainly going to be a factor over the coming months and years.

Importantly, though, the massive rush to buy electric cars since July has also resulted in what S&P Global Mobility calls an EV volume ""hangover."" In other words, July, August and September stole tons of sales from October and beyond, so it's only natural to see an immediate and precipitous slowdown.

Apparently, it could've been worse.

""Actions by multiple manufacturers to reduce EV prices and increase discounts to offset the loss of the federal credit are helping to maintain EV affordability, thereby preventing an even larger decline in EV sales,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power.

Manufacturers are offering thousands in discounts to help make up for the loss of the tax credit and move cars out of inventory. Just after the tax credit lapsed, Hyundai slashed pricing for the 2026 Ioniq 5 by up to $9,800. BMW is offering a $7,500 off of leased EVs through October 31. The list goes on.

The big question, then, is what happens next. Because the tax credit isn't the only big change rocking the EV world.

The Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress have also gutted fuel economy regulations and California's EV mandate, so car companies now face no penalties for electrifying too slowly. That means many will probably choose to dial back their EV growth plans, while doubling down on their gas-burning cash cows for as long as possible.

We've already seen a spate of announcements on that front. Acura last month killed its ZDX SUV after just one model year. Ford is idling production of its F-150 Lightning pickup through the end of the year, although that's also related to aluminum supply. General Motors now plans to make the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt on one shift rather than two, and it laid off 1,750 workers from its EV business this week. Kia on Thursday said it would postpone its upcoming EV4 sedan ""until further notice,"" although that probably had a lot to do with tariffs too.

Given the uncertainty around consumer demand, the hazy future of EV policy and the rapid-fire pullback from automakers, it's not surprising that S&P Global Mobility expects ""continued month-to-month volatility in [battery-electric vehicle] sales and market share"" and ""a significant drop in adoption"" in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Most industry experts believe that Americans will buy more and more EVs over the next several years—even if that growth happens more slowly it would have under friendlier Biden-era policies. But in the near term, it looks like things might get a little ugly.

The United States, for its part, must provide policy clarity on critical mineral agreement negotiations, FTA equivalency, and ESG guidelines.","Amid growing national security concerns about supply chain resiliency and the global energy landscape’s shift toward decarbonization, critical minerals, such as nickel, cobalt, rare earth elements (REEs), copper, lithium, and bauxite, have emerged as indispensable inputs for countries and companies around the world. These minerals are necessary for the developing and manufacturing of emerging technologies ranging from semiconductors to quantum computing, as well as clean technologies including electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy infrastructure, and battery storage systems. Soaring demand for these minerals has placed significant pressure on supply chains that are highly concentrated and geopolitically sensitive.

Indonesia, endowed with substantial reserves of critical minerals, is increasingly being recognized as a central link in these vital global supply chains. Ranked as the world’s largest nickel producer and among the top ten producers of copper and bauxite, Indonesia plays a strategic role in the supply of raw materials required to meet global demand. The government’s policy framework emphasizes not only extraction but also downstream processing, aiming to industrialize and increase domestic value capture. Simultaneously, Indonesia is enhancing cooperation with strategic partners, such as the United States, to attract high-quality investment, improve environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, and gain access to advanced technologies.

This essay analyzes Indonesia’s critical mineral strategy, its bilateral engagement with the United States, and the broader implications for regional and global supply chains. It provides a comprehensive assessment of the opportunities and risks in aligning Indonesia’s mineral wealth with the global decarbonization agenda.

Indonesia’s Critical Mineral Landscape

Indonesia’s mineral endowment is both vast and diverse. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Indonesia holds over 21 million metric tons of nickel reserves—about 22% of global reserves—making it the largest globally. The country produced 1.8 million metric tons of nickel in 2023, a significant increase from 771,000 metric tons in 2020. Indonesia also ranks among the top producers of bauxite, primarily in West Kalimantan and Riau Islands.

Copper production is another critical pillar of Indonesia’s mineral wealth. Grasberg, one of the world’s largest copper and gold mines, is located in Papua and operated by PT Freeport Indonesia. Indonesia’s copper output reached 840,000 metric tons in 2023, positioning it as a strategic supplier for energy infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing.

Southeast Asia more broadly is home to significant untapped potential in REEs and other strategic minerals. According to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar possess valuable REE reserves that remain underdeveloped due to technological, regulatory, and ESG barriers.

Indonesia’s Policy Evolution: From Extraction to Industrialization

Indonesia’s approach to critical minerals has evolved significantly in the past decade, with government policies seeking to move the country up the value chain beyond extraction. The 2009 Mining Law introduced a regulatory shift aimed at achieving this by banning the export of unprocessed ores and mandating domestic processing. This was operationalized in 2014 with the nickel ore export ban and was later extended to bauxite and copper. The goal was to stimulate investment in domestic capacity for smelting, refining, and manufacturing.

Between 2014 and 2023, more than 30 nickel smelters were constructed, primarily in Central Sulawesi and North Maluku. The Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park and Weda Bay Industrial Park are two large-scale hubs that now host nickel processing and battery-precursor production. The downstream policy—termed hilirisasi—is credited with increasing Indonesia’s export value of processed minerals, reducing reliance on raw exports, and attracting over $30 billion in foreign direct investment between 2019 and 2023.

The Prabowo administration has reaffirmed Indonesia’s ambition to move beyond mineral processing and capture greater value from the country’s resource endowment through full-scale industrialization. Building on the downstreaming policies initiated under President Jokowi, President Prabowo has emphasized continuity, while adding a focus on accelerating domestic EV battery and vehicle manufacturing. His administration has pledged to streamline permitting processes, expand fiscal incentives, and develop industrial parks dedicated to EV supply chains. These measures are designed to strengthen Indonesia’s role as a regional production hub while ensuring that investments generate skilled jobs and technology transfer within the country.

In parallel, the administration is adopting a more strategic geopolitical posture. Recognizing the intensifying competition between major economies for critical minerals, Prabowo aims to diversify partnerships and avoid overreliance on any single foreign partner. This includes deepening ties with U.S., South Korean, Japanese, and European firms to balance Indonesia’s existing dependence on Chinese investment. By coupling resource nationalism with pragmatic international engagement, the government seeks to secure Indonesia’s position not only as a leading supplier of ESG-compliant minerals but also as a central node in the global EV and clean energy value chains.

Indonesia’s industrial ambitions also extend beyond smelting. The country aims to become a regional hub for EV battery production and EV assembly. Indonesia Battery Corporation, formed as a state holding company in 2021, has signed partnerships with multiple international companies to develop integrated battery value chains.

Furthermore, Indonesia is promoting its role in the semiconductor supply chain. While it does not yet produce semiconductors, it supplies key inputs such as high-purity tin and copper used in chip interconnects. Integrating mineral and semiconductor strategies could create new growth corridors, especially as ASEAN countries jointly enhance their tech ecosystem.

U.S.-Indonesia Cooperation on Critical Minerals

Under the Biden administration, the U.S. government prioritized the diversification of critical mineral supply chains under the Inflation Reduction Act and the Minerals Security Partnership. In this context, Indonesia is viewed as a key partner.

While Indonesia and the United States do not have a free trade agreement, Jakarta has been lobbying for a sectoral agreement or equivalent with the United States. Negotiations have focused on harmonizing ESG standards, facilitating financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank and U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, and enabling joint research and development on battery technologies. Additionally, in November 2023, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at enhancing collaboration on critical mineral trade, investment, and ESG compliance.

Critical minerals are still a point of focus under the second Trump administration, demonstrated by an executive order aiming to increase domestic production and reduce reliance on China. With recent U.S. legislation phasing out EV tax credits, however, whether the administration will revive negotiations with Indonesia for a critical minerals agreement remains to be seen.

ESG and Sustainable Mining Challenges

Indonesia’s rapid industrialization of critical minerals has brought with it significant ESG concerns. Environmental damage in nickel mining zones, including deforestation, marine pollution from tailings disposal, and air emissions from coal-fired smelters, has sparked resistance from civil society and environmental watchdogs.

To address these concerns, the government has introduced stricter permitting processes, required environmental impact assessments, and encouraged green smelter development using hydropower and solar energy. Indonesia is also participating in global ESG forums and aiming to adopt OECD-aligned practices in responsible sourcing. Nonetheless, enforcement remains inconsistent, and capacity-building in regulatory institutions is needed.

Building secure and reliable rare earth supply chains is also essential to meeting net-zero goals. Unless developing economies such as Indonesia align their industrial ambitions with ESG standards, they risk their exports being excluded from high-value clean tech markets.

Regional Supply Chain Integration and ASEAN Synergies

ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia are also ramping up their critical mineral strategies, leading to both collaboration and competition. Vietnam is investing in REE refining, while the Philippines is expanding copper and nickel mining. Indonesia has advocated for a regional ASEAN framework on critical minerals to pool resources, align standards, and boost bargaining power in global markets.

Regional integration could be operationalized through ASEAN +3 or via bilateral partnerships. A regional critical minerals platform could also support shared ESG monitoring, knowledge exchange, and coordinated investment promotion.

Trade, Geopolitics, and Investment Risks

Global critical mineral markets are increasingly influenced by geopolitical considerations. Indonesia’s efforts to attract U.S. and Western investment must be balanced against its longstanding ties with China, which remains the largest investor in its mineral sector—for example, around 75% of nickel smelters in the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park are Chinese-backed.

Trade risks also include export-price volatility, restrictive clauses in mineral contracts, and technology transfer disputes. To mitigate these risks, Indonesia needs robust investment protection agreements, arbitration mechanisms, and long-term offtake contracts. The United States, for its part, must provide policy clarity on critical mineral agreement negotiations, FTA equivalency, and ESG guidelines.

Conclusion

To enhance its role in global critical mineral supply chains while fostering sustainable development, Indonesia should consider undertaking the following:

Finalizing a sectoral agreement with the United States that recognizes Indonesia’s ESG-compliant minerals as critical to U.S. supply security, granting preferential trade treatment and investment incentives

Establishing a national ESG certification framework aligned with OECD standards and incorporating traceability mechanisms

Promoting R&D and university-industry collaboration in clean processing technologies, recycling, and battery innovation

Supporting ASEAN-wide critical mineral cooperation, including a shared platform for data exchange, standards alignment, and regional investment hubs

Building regulatory capacity and community engagement to ensure inclusive growth and social license to operate

With coordinated reforms, strategic diplomacy, and technological partnerships, Indonesia can position itself not only as a mineral-rich supplier but as a value-added producer and sustainability leader in the energy transition.

The Minneapolis-based utility serves about 3.9 million electric customers in parts of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. The company expects retail sales to grow 5% through 2030.

A 3 GW pipeline of contracted and “high probability” data center projects will drive the majority of that growth, according to the company. Leaders believe Xcel’s data center queue could exceed 20 GW if earlier-stage prospects materialize.

Xcel Energy announced a $15 billion addition to its five-year capital plan on Thursday, which CEO Bob Frenzel said will now cover 7.5 MW of new renewable generation, 3 MW of new gas generation, 1.9 MW of energy storage, 1,500 miles of high-voltage transmission and $5 billion for wildfire mitigation.

Xcel and two telecom companies agreed to a $640 million settlement with plaintiffs in a lawsuit over the 2021-2022 Marshall Fire in Colorado in September. The company excluded a $290 million charge from its share of the Marshall Wildfire settlement in Colorado from quarterly earnings metrics, it noted.

Xcel’s long-term vision includes the addition of 4.5 GW of new natural gas capacity as well as 5 GW of energy storage, Frenzel said.

“Making sure that we can deliver a cleaner energy product as well as a highly reliable and highly affordable product is very strategic as we approach economic development with data centers,” Frenzel said.

New data center load represents about 60% of Xcel’s anticipated retail sales growth through 2030, but it isn’t the only sector driving increased demand at the utility, according to CFO Brian Van Abel. Another 30% of the company’s growth comes from the electrification of the oil and gas sector, and residential load growth and electrification represent about 10% of total sales growth.

Subsidiary Southwestern Public Service Company, which serves customers in New Mexico and Texas, anticipates the fastest growth, with retails sales expected to rise 8% through 2030. Northern States Power Minnesota, Northern States Power Wisconsin and Public Service Company of Colorado all expect 4% sales growth through 2030, according to data from Xcel.

Investment Strategy

Van Abel said the company aims to bring most of its new generation online in between 2028 and 2030. He acknowledged this means their spending and growth projections are more front-heavy than those of other utilities, but he said the goal was to avoid the 2030 “tax credit cliff” and to match the accelerated pace of customers looking to secure renewable energy resources.

But the pace of spending led some analysts on the call to question how much debt the company plans to accrue, and whether it could lead to credit downgrades.

While maintaining a strong balance sheet and healthy credit ratings remains important, Van Abel described these as longer-term priorities.

VACANT LAND: Empty lots in deindustrialized cities like Detroit may contribute to bird species diversity, says a new study by researchers at MSU and Carleton University in Canada. The study is based on sound recordings collected at 110 sites in 11 Detroit neighborhoods. The study recommends that vacant land management in the city takes a balanced approach that considers the needs of both residents and birds. There are other concerns about vacant land, too, including sites for solar arrays. By Eric Freedman. FOR DETROIT, PLANET DETROIT, MICHIGAN CHRONICLE AND ALL POINTS.

That’s according to a new analysis from the green group Climate Power, which is based on data from the US Energy Information Administration.
The president has also waged a war on inexpensive wind and solar power, despite soaring electricity demand driven by artificial intelligence datacenters.

Democratic lawmakers highlighted the figures in a letter sent to Donald Trump on Friday. “Your administration has no explanations for its failures and no answers for American families that are hit hard by high energy costs, and it continues to actively pursue policies to make this cost crisis worse,” reads the missive, led by Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator.

Trump said on the campaign trail that he would “cut the price of energy and electricity in half” by the start of 2026. Since January, however, average utility prices have gone up by 11% nationally, the lawmakers write.

That’s according to a new analysis from the green group Climate Power, which is based on data from the US Energy Information Administration.

Among the reasons for the increase are Trump’s moves to boost fossil fuels, says the new letter, which was also signed by the senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. That includes coal, the costliest and dirtiest energy source.

The president has also waged a war on inexpensive wind and solar power, despite soaring electricity demand driven by artificial intelligence datacenters. More than 12m US homes could have been powered by the clean energy projects that have been cancelled or delayed since Trump’s re-election, says the letter, citing the new Climate Power analysis.

“In effect, you have created a massive cut in energy supply,” the senators say.

Reached for comment, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said: “Democrats should spend less time writing letters, and more time reversing their green energy policies that drove electricity prices up,” claiming that blue states “continue to have higher electricity prices because of their obsession with unreliable and costly green energy sources like wind and solar”.

Trump’s war on renewable power is also spurring job loss, thereby creating even more economic chaos for US households, the lawmakers note. Since he took office, about 150,000 clean energy jobs have been lost or stalled, with another 150,000 potentially facing the same fate, they wrote, citing an earlier analysis of public data by Climate Power.

The White House has also “made the crisis worse” by proposing to eliminate the $4bn which Congress approved for heating and cooling aid via the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the lawmakers say. He is also seeking to cut or eliminate funding for the Energy Star program, which promotes energy-efficiency and has saved Americans $500bn in energy costs, according to federal data.

Meanwhile, Trump’s “chaotic, widely inconsistent tariffs” on imported goods have raised the cost of materials needed for power transmission, which the lawmakers say is “pushing up utility bills” further.

The senators’ letter follows an inquiry they launched in July, when they wrote to the heads of six federal agencies to ask the administration’s plan to meet its pledge to slash utility costs. The responses were “disappointing”, the new letter says, with departments either not replying or only providing “platitudes”.

To lower energy costs, the three senators say, the Trump administration should “restore funding to thousands of energy projects slated to add much-needed supply to the grid, reverse costly fossil fuel plant mandates, and ensure the public continues to have access to the energy bill assistance they deserve”.

The time to act is now, they write: “With heating costs set to soar this winter, it is time to admit that your energy policy has failed and to reverse course before it is too late.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6857ad9721b6bec6d0d2028ec8b1b42725da95c/400_0_4000_3200/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9fabcfba7937452a25cff38c4bb5726d",N,,2025-10-31 14:07:24.589720

Capital News Service

LANSING – Some environmental agencies and organizations are concerned that carbon capture and storage legislation passed recently by the state Senate will harm Michigan’s environment.

Carbon capture and storage is the practice of capturing carbon dioxide in the air and storing it in rock formations underground.

The bills would establish a state regulatory framework that the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy would oversee instead of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.

Under the legislation, an applicant for a state permit would be required to provide notice of the project to all owners of land overlying a proposed storage reservoir, among other requirements.

The legislation “would invite this technology into the state without accounting for critical safeguards necessary to prevent leaks and contamination,” said Grace Noyola, the communications director at the Michigan Environmental Council.

She said that the bills “don’t ensure that sequestration operators are paying their fair share for the use of our state resources, charging only at most 32 cents per ton of stored carbon.”

Noyola also said the legislation might create long-term liability for sequestration projects for Michigan residents because ownership of “closed” projects would fall to the state, along with accountability for any leaks.

And Ben Poulson, the director of government affairs at the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, said, “We think that there are better ways to decarbonize the energy sector and support investments in things like wind and solar instead of paying to burn carbon and then capture carbon and then ship it across the state and store it.”

“All of that is very expensive. Just don’t burn carbon in the first place,” Poulson said.

The legislation would also allow operators to use funding from leases or royalties to pay for road construction through state forests.

The sponsors are Sens. Sean McCann, D-Kalamazoo, John Cherry, D-Flint, and Joseph Bellino Jr., R-Monroe.

Dale George, the director of communications at the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, said that in general, the department supports carbon capture and storage, saying the practice aligns with the MI Healthy Climate Plan.

That’s the state’s action plan to reach 100% carbon neutrality by 2050.

“Carbon capture and storage can play a valuable role in reducing industrial emissions, particularly where eliminating fossil fuels is not feasible,” George said.

“The department believes the practice must be carefully regulated to ensure environmental integrity, public safety and strong community protections,” he said. “ We remain committed to evaluating technologies that support Michigan’s climate goals when implemented responsibly.”

We remain committed to supporting climate action in Bogotá so that it becomes an increasingly inclusive, resilient, and, of course, more sustainable city.” Carlos Fernando Galán, Mayor of Bogotá said: “Bogotá is today a global benchmark in climate action because we have shown that sustainability and equity can advance hand in hand.
Bogotá thus consolidates itself as a leader in climate and social innovation in Latin America, promoting a healthier, fairer, and more sustainable future for its inhabitants.","Bogotá, Colombia – Within the framework of the World Cities Day celebrations today, a high-level discussion will be held at the Hilton Corferias Hotel in Bogotá to present the results of the Urban Climate Action Programme (UCAP) Climate Action Implementation (CAI) Programme.

As a result of this initiative, which is funded by the UK Government and implemented in collaboration with C40 Cities, Bogotá has made significant progress in implementing strategic projects that integrate sustainable mobility, clean energy, and urban planning with an equity and inclusion approach. These efforts are reflected in the concrete results achieved, such as the Public Pedestrian Policy, the urban energy governance model, and the operation of La Rolita, an electric transport system with a focus on gender equity and care.

The Mayor of Bogotá, Carlos Fernando Galán; the British Ambassador to Colombia, George Hodgson; and Hélène Chartier, Director of Urban Development at C40 Cities, are expected to attend the event, which aims to highlight the political and technical commitment of the city and its allies to reduce emissions, strengthen capacities, and build a more sustainable and inclusive urban future. It will bring together municipal authorities, diplomatic representatives, international organisations, partners, beneficiaries, and key local stakeholders.

The event will showcase the key achievements of a collaboration cycle initiated in 2022 with funding from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and support from the British Embassy in Colombia, aimed at implementing priority climate actions in the city. It is also a commemoration of the bicentenary of relations between Colombia and the United Kingdom, reaffirming the importance of solid and continuous cooperation among partners and allies.

During the discussion, projects highlighting Bogotá’s progress in inclusive climate action will be presented, including La Rolita, the 100% electric public transport system with a gender equity focus. Featuring 195 electric buses and a workforce with 63% women drivers, the system is a milestone in equitable, sustainable mobility that actively cuts 8,580 tons of CO2 each year and is being replicated in other cities in the region.

The implementation of the Public Pedestrian Policy (PPP) will also be highlighted. It seeks to guarantee safe and inclusive spaces in a city where walking accounts for 36% of daily trips. With C40’s support, eight strategic circuits of more than 20 km were defined, connecting public transport stations – including the future Line 1 of the Bogotá Metro – with the District Care System and other urban facilities such as schools, kindergartens, health centers, parks, and community spaces.

In the energy sector, Bogotá is advancing in the consolidation of an urban energy governance model, which will allow for an increase in the use of clean sources and ensure the integration of climate action with a gender perspective in planning and decision-making. The capital is the first city in Latin America to have a formal urban energy governance model, aimed at achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This model opens the door to strategic investments in energy efficiency and clean energies, in addition to generating replicable learnings for other cities in the region.

The interventions recognised Bogotá’s advances in implementing public policies that integrate active and sustainable mobility, long-term urban planning, and the generation of green jobs with a gender focus, highlighting the city as a benchmark for global climate leadership. These results are a testament to what can be achieved by aligning public policy, financing, gender focus, and technical capacity to face the climate crisis and build a more sustainable and just future.

George Hodgson, British Ambassador to Colombia said: “Congratulations to Bogotá and C40 for the successes of their programmes to make Bogotá one of the greenest cities in Latin America. From the United Kingdom, we have been working with Bogotá on different fronts to support its commitment to sustainability. We remain committed to supporting climate action in Bogotá so that it becomes an increasingly inclusive, resilient, and, of course, more sustainable city.”

Carlos Fernando Galán, Mayor of Bogotá said: “Bogotá is today a global benchmark in climate action because we have shown that sustainability and equity can advance hand in hand. Being the host city for World Cities Day commits us even further to this vision. Thanks to the joint work with the United Kingdom and C40, we continue to promote projects that transform urban life and show how cities can lead the fight against climate change, and how international cooperation accelerates the transformations the world needs.”

Hélène Chartier, Director of Urban Development at C40 Cities said: “Bogotá’s results show the impact that can be achieved by aligning policy, finance, and technical capacity in the fight against the climate crisis,” said Hélène Chartier, C40 Director of Urban Planning and Design. “Bogotá is a regional leader, driving ambitious, replicable, and inclusive climate measures that promote a just energy transition and the creation of good green jobs through multiple C40 programs, and demonstrates leadership through concrete actions towards the fulfillment of its NDCs, in line with what science defines.”

The event reaffirms the commitment of the UK Government and the Mayor’s Office of Bogotá to climate action and highlights the importance of continued international cooperation through high-impact projects that integrate active mobility, clean energy, and sustainable and equitable urban planning.

KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn’t buy an EV. That’s significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That’s a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans’ anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that’s long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut’s state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He’s taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile range per charge, on a 400-mile trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

[Trump] knows better, but he’s an instrument of the status quo and he’s making money, hand over fist, while the world goes to hell in a handbasket.”

The legendary Star Wars and Indiana Jones actor, who is 83, added: “It’s unbelievable. I don’t know of a greater criminal in history.”

In his second term as president, Trump has set about dismantling climate and clean air protections, halted clean energy projects, urged oil and gas companies to “drill, baby, drill” for the fossil fuels that are overheating the planet, fired hundreds of scientists while deleting their work, and even banned mentions of “climate change” and “emissions” within government.

Trump, who has again withdrawn the US from the Paris climate deal, has also targeted other countries’ climate policies, pressing the UK to tear down its “ugly” wind turbines in favor of more oil drilling and demanding that the European Union roll back its climate rules and purchase more American oil and gas.

Climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, Trump said during a speech to the United Nations last month. “If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail. You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again.”

Ford, a longtime environmental advocate, said Trump’s dislike of wind turbines was because “he has just not seen a gold one” and that the president’s legacy on the climate crisis would be “a clear expression of ignorance, of hubris and purposeful subterfuge”.

The world – including the US, the second largest carbon polluter – continues to lag in the effort to slash planet-heating emissions to curb the sort of disaster suffered this week by Jamaica, which has been lashed by a category 5 hurricane that scientists say was probably accelerated by a warmer atmosphere and ocean.

Earlier this year, Ford himself had to be evacuated from enormous wildfires that engulfed parts of Los Angeles (and were made more likely due to global heating), although his home in Brentwood was spared destruction, unlike those of many other celebrities.

Rising global temperatures are wreaking havoc beyond spectacular disasters such as Hurricane Melissa and the LA fires, too, with a major study this week finding that excess heat is now killing one person a minute around the world.

“I knew it was coming, I have been preaching this stuff for 30 years,” Ford said of these climate-fueled disasters. “Everything we’ve said about climate change has come true. Why is that not sufficient that it alarms people that they change behaviors? Because of the entrenched status quo.”

However, the world is increasingly embracing cleaner forms of energy, albeit at a slower pace than required to stave off escalating climate impacts, and Ford said he was hopeful that Trump’s fossil fuel-dominated vision would not prevail.

“He’s losing ground because everything he says is a lie,” Ford said. “I’m confident we can mitigate against [climate change], that we can buy time to change behaviors, to create new technologies, to concentrate more fully on implementation of those policies.

“But we have to develop the political will and intellectual sophistication to realize that we human beings are capable of change. We are incredibly adaptive, we are incredibly inventive. If we concentrate on a problem we can fix it most times.”

Ford spoke to the Guardian shortly before he was given a conservation leadership award at a ceremony at Chicago’s Field Museum on Wednesday evening. The award was bestowed by the foundation of the late biologist EO Wilson, who coined the term “biodiversity”. Wilson, a myrmecologist, became friends with Ford after they worked on conservation campaigns together and named a species of ant after the actor.

Wilson proposed that half of the planet be protected for nature, to stem ruinous losses to species and ecosystems, an initiative that his foundation, and Ford, continue to support. Worldwide, more than 100 countries have pledged a more modest 30% of land and seas to be preserved by 2030, and although progress has been made in the past year, barely half of this goal has been met, a new report by Wilson’s foundation shows.

“We are teetering on the edge,” Ford said of the ongoing loss of nature via deforestation, pollution and other human-caused destruction.

“Indigenous people are the stewards of much of the remaining standing forests and contain the hope that these precious places can be preserved. The science has proved the value in their preservation but that does not keep them from encroachment, and the protection they are granted is tenuous in some of the countries these assets exist in.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f7055f9ed67a49980b6d16efaeac22ccc96fc9e/506_0_4995_3996/master/4995.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fead72b279b092ff94022d0bf103e683",N,,2025-10-31 13:10:25.792408

Alliant Energy supports the proposal and will provide renewable energy to help power the data center campus.

Data center operator QTS is proposing a multi-billion dollar development in Dane County, and provide a $50 million fund to support Madison Area Technical College and other local institutions.

The company plans to submit a zoning application to the DeForest Village Board in November, according to its Oct. 30 announcement.

Sterling, Virginia-based QTS wants to develop up to five buildings over time − although its plans could change depending on the village approval process. The company has purchase agreements for the project site which are contingent on its rezoning.

QTS will pay for the project's infrastructure if it receives approval, said Tag Greason, co-CEO. Those costs are often paid with property tax revenue generated by new developments.

“We will then also invest in new, renewable energy generation which I think will be a benefit to the community as well,"" Greason told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Greason said QTS will hire area construction firms and workers for the development.

“When we say ‘It’s a project for Dane County,’ it’s about employment opportunities for those who live in and around the region,"" he said.

The data centers would operate with hundreds of workers, Greason said.

QTS, like other data center operators, has a closed-loop liquid cooling system that doesn't require a lot of water for the facilities, Greason said.

""We're not tone deaf to what it means to put a data center in a community,"" Greason said.

Greason said QTS has about 1,200 clients, including large technology companies.

If approved, QTS is also planning on starting a $50 million fund to support local institutions.

Those include scholarships and workforce partnerships with Madison Area Technical College and research partnerships with the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

""My expectation is that we will be successful in our rezoning,"" Greason said.

Alliant Energy on board with proposal

QTS has the support of Alliant Energy with the two companies agreeing on a purchase of 750 megawatts of renewable energy credits to help reduce the impact on Alliant customers.

There's a significant amount of grid capacity in the location where QTS plans to build, said Raja Sundararajan, Alliant executive vice president for strategy and customer solutions

“You won’t see a massive amount of transmission upgrades being built, “ Sundararajan said. “And the local community impact, as a result of new grid upgrades, will be minimum. That’s what made this location so attractive.”

Renewable energy provided by Alliant would help power the data center campus.

""We have an obligation to make sure existing customers are not harmed as a result of QTS coming in,"" Sundararajan said.

Gibson graduated as the valedictorian of her class at Carvers Bay High School.
But a high school accounting class introduced her to the field and to a retired partner at accounting firm Ernst & Young.
“I am a first-generation college student, but there was never an option that I wasn’t going to go to college,” Thomas says.
And she has some advice for employers looking to recruit and hire job candidates looking for their first job: Choose first-generation college graduates.","First-generation college students come from all sorts of backgrounds and bring myriad perspectives to the University of South Carolina campus.

At USC, about one-fifth of the student population — more than 7,000 — are considered first-generation, meaning their parents did not complete a bachelor’s degree. Across the country, nearly 5 million undergraduate students identified as first-gen in 2020, one in every three students.

“First-generation students are trailblazers and their willingness to be ‘first’ demonstrates their belief in the transformative power of higher education,” says Althea D. Counts, executive director of TRIO Programs at USC. “There are first-generation students in leadership roles on campus and in our classrooms, bringing diverse lived experiences that are essential and enrich our campus environment.”

As the university marks the celebration of First-Gen College Celebration Week Nov. 3-7, we caught up with first-generation students, alumni, faculty and staff who are thriving in the classroom and beyond.

Faces of first-gen

Karra McCray Gibson grew up in the tiny South Carolina community of Dunbar in rural Georgetown County, where her childhood days started with some rules set down by her mother.

“Before we could go outside in the summer, we had to read books. My mom would quiz us and make sure that we could identify the setting and the main characters in the story before going outside. And we had to write,” Gibson says. “I hated it at the time, but I'm so grateful now.”

The commitment to education Gibson's mother stressed in their home served her daughter well. Gibson graduated as the valedictorian of her class at Carvers Bay High School. She had plenty of college options but decided to stay in-state where she received scholarships and the support of programs like the Opportunity Scholars at USC.

“I knew ever since I was a young girl I wanted to go to college,” she says. “It just made the most sense for me to come here. And I was able to graduate undergrad debt-free. So that was a really good decision.”

She was a member of the TRIO program at USC, which helped her adjust from life in a small town to navigating a large campus.

“I remember feeling very overwhelmed but also excited at the same time,” she says. “Being first-gen, in addition to the culture shock, I didn’t really know what I could ask or should ask. I was grateful for opportunities like the TRIO program, because not only were there resources and faculty and staff there who understood, I think it actually provided me with confidence that I could compete and excel academically and socially, even on a large campus.”

Once on campus, she jumped into activities — including being president of Alpha Lambda Delta honor society, pledging Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and holding down a part-time job. She also landed a job with her state representative — who asked her at her high school graduation if she was interested in working for him as a legislative aide at his office in Columbia.

Her original plan was to attend law school, until former TRIO director Paul Beasley suggested she apply for the Ronald McNair Scholars summer program, established to prepare participants for graduate school through research and other scholarly activities. She participated in the program the summer before her senior year, and she says it changed the trajectory of her life.

“Being from a small town, and also first-gen, I didn't necessarily see a professor as a career path. I didn't know that was possible. I didn't know what it would entail. I didn't know the benefits,” she says. “And so it was truly that program and being able to work on an independent research project, where I end up winning an award at the annual conference, that truly ignited my passion and showed me that this was something that I could do, but also that I could be good at it if I worked hard enough.”

After graduating with degrees in political science and English, she went to Howard University for her master’s in Black politics and American politics before heading to the Ivy League where she earned her doctorate from Brown University. She defended her dissertation in June and came home to USC this fall as an assistant professor of political science.

“It’s such a full circle moment that I could not have imagined when I left almost 10 years ago,” she says. “But it’s so rewarding to be back.”

And, now at the front of the classroom, she says she starts each course with an introduction that includes more than just listing her degrees.

“I tell them where I'm from and show it on a map. I say that I'm first-gen. I want all students who come to my class to know that if someone like me could do it, anyone else could.”

Austin LaForest recalls the questions he asked himself during his freshman year as a first-generation college student at Ohio University.

“Do I belong here? Am I going to be found out that I’m not smart enough?” he says. “I hadn’t traveled much outside my area, and there are people here from all over the world and people who have traveled the world. So, I definitely felt out of place. And I struggled academically.”

He remembers the feeling — and he uses it now to counsel and relate to students in his job as director of student care and case management at USC.

After all, it was mentors, faculty and administrators who inspired him as an undergraduate and helped him find his path.

LaForest grew up in Galion, Ohio, a town of about 10,000 people surrounded by cornfields between Cleveland and Columbus. His father worked in the steel mill and his mother held a variety of jobs — from working in a photo lab to a bank.

He credits his mom with pushing him to attend college. She had worked full time while she was in high school and wasn’t able to make her dream of going to the local community college a reality.

“Growing up, her message to me was, ‘I don't care. You are going to work hard in high school. You are going to college. That’s going to be your No. 1 priority.’ So that was a consistent message growing up. I would have been terrified to tell my mom I wasn’t going to college.”

In high school, he had the opportunity to be a part of a first-generation college student program called Seniors to Sophomores. As a senior, he took classes at a community college about 20 minutes from home, earning a full year of college credit by the time he finished high school.

He enrolled at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio as a physics major, switching his second quarter to political science. By the end of his freshman year, he switched to education, and graduated with a degree to teach social studies.

But it was the relationships he built with student affairs administrators as an undergraduate that helped steer his career.

“They were really instrumental in helping me understand what I could do, what my potential was. They made me feel like I belonged,” he says. “Meeting people and getting involved was really life-changing for me.”

By his senior year, he decided to go to graduate school for higher education student affairs.

“And that started my journey of working on college campuses and really being passionate about being a resource for students the way that so many people were for me.”

He arrived at USC in 2018, and now oversees the care and outreach team in Student Affairs. His journey as a first-generation student influences his job now, he says, by making him realize that every student comes to college with different experiences.

“I try not to go into a conversation with assumptions and try to be curious about the student that I'm sitting with. And, especially for students who may feel more like nontraditional students, I share with them that there are many students walking on campus who are also feeling the same way, asking ‘Do I belong here? Do I fit in?’”

He says his job is to reassure them of their place and their value as part of the USC community.

“One first-gen student’s experience can look totally different from another first-gen student. So, it’s not that we necessarily share every single lived experience. It's more about that shared connection of like, ‘Hey, I’m the first person who’s doing this. And I'm proud of overcoming some obstacles and some hurdles.’ That’s a really great connection point that I can make with the students.”

Kelvin Pearson always knew he would attend college. At career day in elementary school, he announced he would be a lawyer, and he hasn’t strayed from that path.

He was a high achiever, always in gifted and talented classes in school. “When I made one C in high school, I almost cried,” he says. “So, yeah, I expected to come to college.”

He graduated at the top of his high school class in Manning, South Carolina, and earned a full ride to USC, where he is a sophomore majoring in political science. And he still has his eyes set on law school.

He also understands the significance of being the first member of his extended family to attend college, and he feels a responsibility to his hometown and his community. The role of “role model” is one he embraces.

“To me, I am very proud to be a first-generation student. It means I’m breaking the stereotypes,” Pearson says. “A lot of people wouldn't have expected someone from my community to come to college. I was the only Black male in the top 20 of our high school class. For someone like me, to do that and break those barriers, it shows not only that we are capable, but it also shows that others like me at my high school can do that as well.

“And I just like being that role model for other people.”

He credits TRIO for helping him find a home — along with friends and mentors — at USC.

“TRIO has meant everything to me. They gave me mentors. They always stayed on me and made sure I got my assignments done. And when I just needed someone to talk to, I had someone to talk to,” he says. “I went through a period when my great-grandmother died, and I just really felt at my lowest. I still had my mentor there to help me. It was like comforting me, make sure I was straight, but also make sure my coursework was still getting done. Because this is still school and life happens, and we do need to grieve but also push past it.”

TRIO also allowed him to have a place to go during his free time where he could meet new people and find friends with similar backgrounds. The tutoring center at TRIO helped him both academically and socially, with tutors becoming friends.

He was named Mr. Freshman by the Association for African American Students and was selected to be a summer orientation leader, helping new freshmen find their paths at USC. And he became more involved in TRIO, serving as co-chair of the student lead team, which advocates for students.

“I can help incoming freshmen by pushing past some of those barriers that I saw myself during my freshman year. As a first-generation student, yes, you’re the first to do what you've done, but you also need to make sure you’re not the last. Continue to help the people that came after you; help them break the barriers that you broke.”

Ashley Thomas saw firsthand what TRIO could do for first-generation students on the USC campus. It made such an impact on her that she worked to implement some of the benefits of the program in her accounting career.

Thomas grew up in Myrtle Beach, thinking she would become an architect. But a high school accounting class introduced her to the field and to a retired partner at accounting firm Ernst & Young. She changed her career sights and made the decision to be a Gamecock.

“I am a first-generation college student, but there was never an option that I wasn’t going to go to college,” Thomas says. “Neither one of my parents went and none of my grandparents went, but I don’t remember a time growing up that it wasn’t like ‘You’re going to college.’”

At USC, she qualified for the Pell Grant, and the TRIO office offered her a scholarship.

“Both my parents were (living) paycheck to paycheck, so I was going for every scholarship I could get,” she says. “So when they reached out and I met them, I got really excited about it.”

She majored in accounting, but taking a class with English professor Ruth Strickland led her to add a minor in English and learn a skillset that she didn’t even know she wanted — the ability to write clear, argumentative papers. Thomas earned her undergraduate degree in accounting in 2006 and stayed on as Strickland’s graduate assistant while she earned her master of accountancy the following year.

As her accounting career took off, she worked for Thermo Fisher Scientific, a massive firm that provides a range of products and services for scientific research, diagnostics and manufacturing. During the summer of 2020, when protests surrounding the death of George Floyd filled the news, Thomas said the company took an active role in reaching out to different groups of people. Thomas became part of the team trying to figure out ways to reach college age students,

“The idea was to get people of color to be scientists or accountants or whatever. So I said, ‘I know this great organization. It’s TRIO.’ We ended up basically creating a partnership between Thermo Fisher and TRIO.”

Thomas said the idea was basic — putting together presentations for first- and second-year college students to teach budgeting skills along with exposing them to types of careers that are possible at Thermo Fisher.

“It was to offer a service to be like, ‘Hey, we’re kind of nerdy accountants. But we can tell you a few things that hopefully can give you some value as college students.’ Some of it was things I wish I would have heard as a freshman, like not to take out that credit card. But we were doing it with students that probably wouldn't know anything about Thermo Fisher because their parents weren't in the scientific research world.”

She says the program reached about 500 students across the country.

“I found so much value in TRIO and what it's doing for students that I continue to want to be involved wherever I can. And a lot of that's because of (USC TRIO director Althea) Counts and the teachers. But it’s also because, while I still would have gone to school without TRIO, I know there are other students that wouldn’t. It’s such a critical organization.”

Thomas has moved to a new job as the global controller for Bioventus, a medical device company. She is based near Chapel Hill, North Carolina. And she says she hopes her new firm will eventually forge a connection with TRIO.

And she has some advice for employers looking to recruit and hire job candidates looking for their first job: Choose first-generation college graduates.

“I guarantee you that person had to work harder,” she says. “And they will work much harder as an employee. I know what they’ve been through. To me, that person is going to be a much more dedicated employee than the person that had their parents pay for their school 100 percent.”

Nobody in Grace Ware’s family expected her to go to college.

An Army brat, she was born in California and grew up on military bases in New York, Arizona and Georgia. She graduated from high school in Myrtle Beach.

Her father was insistent on her joining the military as her older brothers had done. Her mother told her she wasn’t smart enough to go to college, and she would have to get a full ride to attend.

But Ware knew she didn’t want to enter the military. She wanted to go to a research university and look at a career in research or medicine. USC fit the bill. She earned scholarships and qualified for the TRIO program.

She is now a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering and is a teaching assistant in Physics 211.

It hasn’t been the easiest road. Ware says she was a rebellious teen — her mother kicked her out of their house when she turned 18. She stayed at a friend’s house in the months before she moved to Columbia to attend USC.

“It sounds kind of rebellious, but it kind of just proves to me that I can do really difficult stuff just on my own, and I don't necessarily have to rely on others,” she says. “I have the work ethic and dedication to push through and do something myself and figure out the hard stuff.”

Once she arrived at USC, she found TRIO on campus. While her classes and research have taught and challenged her, TRIO has given her community.

“It was like a support group, almost. If I needed someone to hang out with, I had TRIO,” she says. “I could hang out in the lounge or go and study in the lounge. And they had all the tutoring and mentoring programs.”

She says she initially came to the university interested in working with nerve generation and prosthetics, after seeing veterans, including her father, deal with the effects of injuries. Now she is interested in working with stem cells and organoids, three-dimensional, miniature versions of organs that provide an accurate model of real human organs.

“I joined a research lab at the medical school, and they do cell biology with organoids, testing CGRP peptides. And then they use that to study how it stimulates regeneration in other tissues,” she says. “And I just thought that was so cool. So, I’ve kind of shifted from wanting to do prosthetics to wanting to do cell and biomaterials/biophysics with organoids specifically.”",https://www.sc.edu/uofsc/images/twitter_images/2025/11-twitter-first-gen-stories.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 13:10:16.011282

With this increasing demand, utility stocks like GE Vernova GEV and Enphase Energy ENPH are becoming attractive investment options.

The swift expansion of extensive artificial intelligence-driven data centers is leading to a substantial rise in energy usage, as these operations need considerable electricity to run servers and cooling systems around the clock. Increasing global temperatures are exacerbating electricity requirements, particularly for air conditioning and cooling mechanisms, while the growing use of electric vehicles (EVs) is generating new, ongoing demands for electricity.

Government decarbonization targets and clean energy mandates are also pushing utilities and corporations to transition toward renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Grid modernization initiatives are also gaining momentum, aimed at integrating intermittent renewables and improving reliability and resilience.

Furthermore, the increasing demand for effective energy storage technologies, which are essential for maintaining supply and demand balance, underlines the strategic significance of businesses positioned as integrators of sustainable energy. Together, these patterns support the long-term growth prospects of companies engaged in energy storage, smart grid technologies, and renewable energy production.

GE Vernova benefits from its diversified business across Power, Wind, and Electrification, which allows it to provide customers with a full suite of solutions, from gas and nuclear to wind energy and grid technology. Because of its flexibility, the business appeals to a broad range of customers and remains resilient to market changes.

The company's strategy includes developing sustainable products, modernizing existing power plants, and investing in research and innovation to accelerate the transition to a more reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy future. During the third quarter of 2025, GEV’s Power unit signed over 12 gigawatts (GW) of new gas equipment contracts, including 12 GW of slot reservation agreements and 1 GW of orders. It converted 7 GW of existing slot reservation agreements to orders and shipped 4 GW of equipment. Its Wind unit secured 0.3 GW of onshore wind repowering orders, with 0.6 GW booked year to date.

The Standpoint of ENPH

Enphase Energy is a pioneer in energy storage, household energy management, and solar microinverter systems. ENPH is a solid investment in the decentralized clean energy future due to its advancements in distributed energy resources and its global presence in residential solar installations. Under each solar panel, ENPH's microinverters transform DC power into AC power individually. This method improves system reliability as well as effectiveness over conventional string inverters.

In October 2025, ENPH announced expanded support for virtual power plants (VPP) across Europe. Its products now enable advanced energy market steering and smart grid features, such as one-minute data streaming, instant alerts for VPP events and system maintenance, and home solar curtailment to support grid constraints. Additionally, the company is extending its ties with top energy providers to support regulating EV chargers and heat pumps.

Let's compare the two stocks' fundamentals to determine which one is a better investment option at present.

Initially, Duke's proposal suggested the Cayuga station's aging coal plants would be shut down.
Per the final ruling from the IURC on October 29, 2025, Duke will retain clean energy financial incentives while building the new natural gas units.
During testimony, one estimate projected Duke customers will pay an addition $29 a month by the time the two natural gas units are up and running.
Both natural gas and coal plants emit carbon dioxide, which blankets the earth's atmosphere and is the leading contributor to global warming.","Duke Energy Indiana has received approval for two new natural gas units at Cayuga Station in Vermillion County, Indiana, after about six months of sparring with opponents before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC).

One recurring sticking point: Would Duke have a financial incentive to embark on clean energy projects to replace coal plants? Initially, Duke's proposal suggested the Cayuga station's aging coal plants would be shut down.

But after pushback and then a settlement with the coal trade association Reliable Energy Inc. (REI) in June, Duke will now investigate the feasibility of keeping the coal plants online to be sold to a third party.

Per the final ruling from the IURC on October 29, 2025, Duke will retain clean energy financial incentives while building the new natural gas units. Alongside them, the coal plants might continue running.

The clean energy incentive, called Construction Work in Progress, allows Duke to charge ratepayers for the project while the plant is being constructed, which reduces financing costs for the utility. Angeline Protogere, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy Indiana, said this kind of financing will save customers more than $800 million over the life of the new plant.

That's still too much for consumer advocates. During testimony, one estimate projected Duke customers will pay an addition $29 a month by the time the two natural gas units are up and running.

""Bills are going to go up — dramatically,"" said Kerwin Olson, the executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group that intervened on the case. Ratepayers ""can't afford to pay what they're paying today. And disappointingly, the commission somehow justified that this proposal satisfies the affordability pillar of state policy.""

A strained grid

Duke contends that the project is necessary given the pressure on Indiana's electric grid and the utility's service area. Duke has added about 126,000 new customers since 2013, and the coal plants at Cayuga Station are nearly 60 years old.

Duke has already felt the effects of the squeeze: in advance of the summer of 2025, the utility had to purchase 470 megawatts of power to satisfy regional reliability requirements.

""It's our responsibility to constantly evaluate the demand for power on our system, and to make sure that we meet that demand,"" Protogere said.

The two natural gas units at Cayuga are designed to bridge the gap, adding 1,476 megawatts to the grid — 470 megawatts of capacity more than what the site's coal units currently offer.

Big bills, more emissions

Opponents to the project expressed frustration that financial incentives for clean energy are being used to fund fossil fuel projects without retiring coal plants as the original bill intended. Both natural gas and coal plants emit carbon dioxide, which blankets the earth's atmosphere and is the leading contributor to global warming.

Duke ""got everything they wanted,"" Olson said. ""It's just really, really disheartening and disappointing.""

The Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the state agency tasked to advocate for ratepayers, recommended that the state deny the utility's petition on the grounds of affordability. In addition, multiple advocacy groups testified against Duke's petition over the past several months.

But IURC's final ruling found that Duke's proposal satisfied Indiana's five pillars of energy policy: reliability, resilience, stability, affordability, and environmental sustainability. Olson, however, does not think Duke's approach to affordability and environmental sustainability is a good one.

""This is going to increase fossil fuel use in Indiana, carbon emissions, exacerbate public health problems, the climate crisis. There's that aspect of this order, which is really, really frustrating and sad,"" he said. ""But there's also the significant economic aspect of this order, which means higher prices on monthly utility bills, hitting Duke rate payers, and it's just — whatever sort of adjective you want to put in there — it's just really frustrating.""

""This HoA represents another key step in building the mine-to-oxide pathway between allied nations,"" stated Pat Ryan, P.Eng., Ucore's Chairman and CEO. ""By partnering with Wyloo and Hastings, we are securing potential feedstock for our Louisiana SMC and exploring U.S. Hydromet options that add flexibility and scale to our DoD-backed RapidSX™ separation program.""

Chief Executive Officer, Mr Vince Catania said: ""We are delighted to partner with Ucore on this strategically significant HoA. This agreement represents a major step forward in de-risking the Yangibana Project by securing a pathway to a long-term offtake partner in the key North American market. More importantly, the joint evaluation of a downstream Hyrdromet plant in the US demonstrates the efforts by Wyloo, Ucore and Hastings to access the financing and commercial opportunities arising from the recently announced rare earth deal by the US and Australian governments to jointly support ""ready to go"" projects.""

Geoff Atkins, VP Business Development at Ucore, added: ""Yangibana is one of the world's most advanced, shovel-ready rare earth projects, with amongst the highest distributions of NdPr of any known deposit. This agreement is an important step in Ucore securing a fully aligned mine-to-oxide supply chain across trusted jurisdictions.""

Expanded Details on the HoA

Under the HoA, Wyloo and Hastings (through their 60:40 Yangibana Joint Venture) and Ucore will work collaboratively to advance a potential long-term offtake and Hydromet partnership.

Feedstock Framework: The HoA contemplates up to 37,000 tonnes per annum of Yangibana rare earth concentrate, sourced from the Stage 1 mine and beneficiation circuit of the Yangibana Project. Pricing is to be based on a per-DMT formula or fixed structure to be defined in the definitive offtake agreement.

U.S. Hydromet Evaluation: The parties will jointly complete a Gap Analysis and techno-economic assessment of a new Hydromet facility in Louisiana, or a qualified third-party U.S. facility, to convert concentrate into mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) suitable for downstream separation at Ucore's SMC.

Strategic Alignment: The project supports the United States-Australia Framework for Securing of Supply in the Mining and Processing of Critical Minerals and Rare Earths (""U.S.-Australia Framework"") announced on October 20, 2025, which aims to build integrated supply chains across allied jurisdictions. The HoA directly responds to this initiative by linking Australian concentrate production with U.S. mid-stream processing and separation.

Timeline and Governance: The HoA is non-binding (except for clauses related to confidentiality and governing law, which is Australian), has a 24-month term, and may be extended by mutual consent.

Strategic Benefits

For Ucore: Anchors an allied feedstock source for Ucore's DoD-funded Louisiana SMC, supporting commissioning in H2-2026 and establishing one of the first U.S. facilities capable of producing separated rare earth oxides at commercial scale.

For Wyloo and Hastings: Opens a U.S. downstream channel into the magnet materials market through a government-supported separation platform, strengthening financing and offtake options during the Yangibana Project's ramp-up.

Virginia’s largest energy utility also has linked potential future rate increases to inflation and other costs.
Clean Virginia, a clean energy advocacy group that targets utility corruption, has backed all three Democratic candidates for statewide office in Virginia — a first for the organization.
To further complicate an already complex issue: Virginia has passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which calls for utilities to sunset carbon energy production methods by 2045.","If there’s agreement on anything in the two states with governor’s races this year, it’s that utility bills are a growing concern among voters.

One Virginia voter, Kim Wilson, lamented at a town hall recently that her electricity bill seems to go up every month, no matter how much she tries to mitigate the costs. She was drawn to the event in part by its title: “The energy bills are too damn high.”

“It’s way too high,” Wilson readily agreed.

In New Jersey, Herb Michitsch of Kenilworth said his electric bill has climbed to nearly $400 a month, or more than four times what it was when he and his wife moved into their home half a century ago.

“Something really has to be done,” Michitsch said.

That something must be done is pretty much where the agreement ends. It’s what must be done that splits politicians back into rival camps.

Democratic candidates in the two states are far more likely to embrace clean energy options like wind and solar than their Republican opponents. The two states’ Republican nominees are more closely aligned with the policies of President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a “con job” and promotes more traditional energy sources like gas and coal. New Jersey Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli has acknowledged that human-caused climate change is occurring, but he says Democrats have driven up costs with their clean energy push.

Which side voters land on in the off-year elections will give both parties plenty to consider in what feels destined to be an emerging economic issue heading into next year’s midterm elections.

At a recent rally in New Jersey, Democratic state Sen. Vin Gopal made clear that he stood with Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill in support of her plans to lower costs. But Gopal acknowledged that the outcome could signal whether voters are ready to embrace the president’s approach or have simply grown weary of national politics.

“The whole country is watching what happens,” he said.

Technology drives up costs

The debate comes as people in the two states grapple with double-digit percentage increases in monthly electricity bills. The exploding costs are driven by soaring demand, particularly from data centers, and by the rapid onset of energy-intensive artificial intelligence technology. Virginia’s largest energy utility also has linked potential future rate increases to inflation and other costs.

In Virginia’s open race to succeed a term-limited GOP incumbent, Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears are at odds over the development of renewable energy sources.

Spanberger has laid out a plan to expand solar and wind production in underused locations, praising a wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach. In a debate against her opponent, she also said she would “ensure that data centers pay their fair share” as costs rise. The state is home to the world’s largest data center market,

Republican Winsome Earle-Sears wasn’t having it.

“That’s all she wants, is solar and wind,” Earle-Sears said of Spanberger at the debate. “Well, if you look outside, the sun isn’t shining and the breeze isn’t blowing, and then what, Abigail, what will you do?”

In New Jersey, where Ciattarelli’s endorsement by Trump included recent social media posts praising his energy affordability plans, the GOP nominee blames rising costs on eight years of Democratic control of state government.

Ciattarelli says he would pull New Jersey out of a regional greenhouse gas trading bloc, which Democratic incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy reentered when he first took office in 2018.

“It’s been a failure,” Ciattarelli said at the final debate of the campaign. “Electricity is at an all-time high.”

He’s also come out as a strident opponent of wind energy off the state’s coast, an effort Democrats spearheaded under Murphy. A major offshore wind project ground to a halt when the Danish company overseeing it scrapped projects, citing supply chain problems and high interest rates.

At the center of Sherrill’s campaign promise on the issue is an executive order to freeze rates and build cheaper and cleaner power generation.

“I know my opponent laughs at it,” Sherrill said recently.

A growing concern among voters

The candidates’ focus on affordability and utility rates reflects an unease among voters. A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults, at a time when data center development for AI could further strain the power grid.

Perhaps that’s why the statewide races have become something of an energy proxy battle in Virginia. Clean Virginia, a clean energy advocacy group that targets utility corruption, has backed all three Democratic candidates for statewide office in Virginia — a first for the organization. GOP statewide candidates, meanwhile, have accepted money from Dominion Energy, the largest electric utility in Virginia.

To further complicate an already complex issue: Virginia has passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which calls for utilities to sunset carbon energy production methods by 2045.

Republican House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, who represents the southwest edge of Virginia, had failed to alter part of the state’s Clean Economy Act earlier this year. Kilgore, whose top donor is Dominion Energy, said in February: “If their bills go any higher, there are folks in my region that are not able to pay them now, they’re definitely not going to be able to pay them in the future.”

Evan Vaughn, executive director of MAREC Action, a group of Mid-Atlantic renewable energy developers, said candidates from both parties are in a tough spot because bringing down prices quickly will be difficult given broader market dynamics.

“Voters should look to which candidate they think can do the best to stabilize prices by bringing more generation online,” he said. “That’s really going to be the key to affordability.”

Michitsch, who’s backing Sherrill in the governor’s race and said he would campaign for her, said her proposal shows she’s willing to do something to address spiraling costs.

“We need to change,” he said. “And I think she is here to change things.”

The US and China are forecast to both see massive increase in power demand from AI data centres, in particular, as the two countries compete to dominate in the technology.
A report yesterday from Wood Mackenzie said that the growth of AI data centre demand is a barrier to reaching global net zero and meeting the Paris Climate Agreement global warming commitments.
Analysis from the firm said the surge in AI data centre demand “threatens electricity crises and higher tariffs while derailing 2030 clean power commitments”.
Data centre demand may more than double between now and 2030, potentially reaching up to 1,000TWh annually.","Both projects are aiming to come online in Q3 2027 and will deliver power to the Louisiana grid, which is split between the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Southwest Power Pool (SPP) Independent System Operators. Through funding the sites, Meta will put the environmental attributes, like renewable energy credits, towards its decarbonisation statistics.

“When we announced our AI data centre in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year, we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid—and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that, while also helping match our operations with clean energy,” said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta.

So-called “hyperscalers”—tech firms like Meta, which operate global data centre networks—could theoretically meet their growing US demand by financing residential rooftop solar and energy storage installations, according to research by the US electrification non-profit, Rewiring America.

These firms could “more than meet” their electricity needs by paying for residential solar and energy storage systems across the US, the report said, by reducing demand and load on the grid, particularly at peak times, and simultaneously reducing energy bills for consumers.

This type of demand destruction would undermine the integrity of the RFS.” ACE emphasized that history has shown how harmful SREs can be to ethanol demand.
“EPA must reallocate 100% of the 2023 through 2025 exempted RVOs – an estimated 2.18 billion gallons – to the final Set 2 rule.
Finally, ACE pressed EPA to act swiftly.
“It is imperative to finalize this rulemaking before the end of the 2025 calendar year to get the RFS back on track and provide certainty to all parties,” Jennings concluded.","Sioux Falls, SD – The American Coalition for Ethanol (ACE) submitted comments today to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in response to the Agency’s supplemental proposed rule for the “Set 2” Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program covering 2026 and 2027, urging the Agency to fully reallocate the impacts of Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) and finalize the rule before year-end.

“We appreciate the important step EPA is taking with this supplemental proposal to rectify and reallocate the impacts of SREs issued for the 2023 and 2024 RFS compliance years, as well as reallocation for SREs anticipated for 2025,” said ACE CEO Brian Jennings in written comments. “If the volumes of renewable fuel represented by the SREs are not reallocated, obligated parties could use the oversupply of low-priced RINs to satisfy future renewable volume obligations instead of buying and blending physical gallons of ethanol and other renewable fuel. This type of demand destruction would undermine the integrity of the RFS.”

ACE emphasized that history has shown how harmful SREs can be to ethanol demand. “SRE-induced demand destruction occurred in 2018 and 2019 when D6 RIN values cratered from $1.00 per gallon to $0.20 or less following EPA’s decision to grant 85 SREs covering the 2016 through 2018 compliance years,” Jennings noted. “More than 4 billion gallons of blending obligations were effectively erased for refiners through EPA’s action at that time, discouraging refiners from blending ethanol above E10 and restraining sales of E15, E30, and E85.”

Jennings said EPA has an opportunity to prevent that from happening again. “EPA must reallocate 100% of the 2023 through 2025 exempted RVOs – an estimated 2.18 billion gallons – to the final Set 2 rule. The 100% full reallocation approach is the only way to ensure blending obligations remain whole for 2026 and 2027.”

Beyond reallocation, ACE reiterated support for EPA’s proposal to set record-high renewable fuel volumes and encouraged EPA to consider conventional biofuel levels exceeding 15 billion gallons to offset potential export market losses and ensure conventional ethanol maintains its role in the fuel supply.

ACE’s comments also backed EPA’s proposal to reduce RIN generation for imported fuels and foreign feedstocks and called for improvements to the Agency’s lifecycle modeling for biofuels. “We encourage EPA to modify its methodology to align with real-world observations and actions taken by Congress, including use of GREET and GTAP-BIO modeling approaches,” Jennings said.

Finally, ACE pressed EPA to act swiftly. “It is imperative to finalize this rulemaking before the end of the 2025 calendar year to get the RFS back on track and provide certainty to all parties,” Jennings concluded.",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2470/2023/09/20221806/Untitled-1021-x-640-px-9-898x563.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 14:07:15.714145

This is how we protect Illinoisans from bill spikes and grow Illinois’ clean energy economy.","The Illinois Senate passed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act, also known as SB25, on Thursday. The bill passed the House on Wednesday, so it's now headed to the governor's desk. It's a move that's getting mixed reactions.

State Senator Jil Tracy (R-Quincy) issued a statement criticizing the passage of the ""so-called 'Energy Omnibus Bill.'""

“Democratic policies have created a mess for Illinois families, and this latest energy bill only digs the hole deeper,"" Senator Tracy said. ""Just when we thought things couldn’t get more chaotic after the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), this proposal removes crucial protections, hands unelected bureaucrats unchecked power to raise utility rates, and risks closing reliable local power plants while subsidizing unreliable energy. The result? Families face skyrocketing bills while billions flow to special interest groups and not to the people who actually pay the bills. Illinoisans deserve affordable, reliable energy, not this mess.”

The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition says the bill protects consumers from energy price spikes and safeguards Illinois’ climate commitments made in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.

“With the passage of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, Illinois is standing up to President Trump’s dismantling of the clean energy economy and boldly leading the way forward. At a time when utility bills are rising due to unprecedented demand for energy, largely driven by data centers, Illinois is taking decisive action to mitigate rising costs while solidifying our clean energy economy for generations to come,"" the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition said in a statement Thursday night.

“The CRGA Act makes transformative investments in the most cost-effective, reliable resources needed to meet growing demand: battery storage, energy efficiency, and wind and solar. This is how we protect Illinoisans from bill spikes and grow Illinois’ clean energy economy. It is also how we step away from the status quo of Illinois families paying too much to prop up expensive dirty energy plants that pad the profits of out of state fossil fuel corporations instead of building cost-effective, new clean energy resources that are better for consumers and boost economic development. We applaud the General Assembly for taking action.

“As Illinois steps forward to responsibly tackle our energy and affordability challenges, this victory must be followed by legislative action in the spring 2026 session to ensure that Big Tech and data centers, the primary driver of rising utility bills, join the solution instead of continuing to be the problem. Illinois has proven that it can tackle complex energy policy issues while keeping equity, consumers, and worker protections at the forefront, and the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition looks forward to working with stakeholders next spring to build on that progress.”

The Illinois Manufacturers’ Association says the sweeping energy proposal doesn't go far enough to address the underlying issues. The association said in a statement Thursday night the bill will result in massive electric rate hikes on businesses and consumers.

“Manufacturers need reliable and affordable energy to produce the goods consumers rely on, including food, pharmaceuticals, machinery and household products. Unfortunately, this proposal repeats mistakes of the past, raising costs on manufacturers and working families without addressing underlying capacity and supply issues that are projected to lead to energy shortfalls,” said Mark Denzler, President and CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. “While there are some provisions of this legislation we support, including lifting the moratorium on nuclear facilities, more work needs to be done to strengthen our state’s energy marketplace, protect consumers and encourage long-term economic investment. We remain committed to offering workable solutions, including advocating for an all-of-the-above approach that includes renewables, maintains operations at current baseload plants, adds new power generation, and invests in more transmission lines and affordable technologies.”",https://foxillinois.com/resources/media/a01141ed-4601-4554-ad4d-320d65970e2a-IMG_0532.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 13:08:55.433894

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.
Texas Resiliency Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.
“I think that these technologies—wind, solar, storage, demand response—they’re not experiments anymore,” Boms said.
“They’re the backbone of the Texas grid and the economy.”","Texas’ efforts to maintain a resilient power grid in the face of rising demand and storm threats are being tested by the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy.

The Lone Star state is unique compared to others because it allowed the market to determine what resources to invest in, leading to extensive transmission lines transporting solar and wind energy. Those renewables are particularly abundant due to Texas’ extensive and sunny landscape, and have been supported by the state’s growth of battery storage.

“Texas is number one in wind and solar not by accident, but because we have the resources, the infrastructure, and the market design to make it happen,” said Matthew Boms, executive director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance under Advanced Energy United.

All of that is strained by President Donald Trump demanding the end of clean energy subsidies and restricting federal funding for renewables programs, provoking one Texas county to fight back in the courts.

“Infrastructure has been a big part of Texas’ success story in renewables,” said Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association. “A lot of this progress in Texas is under threat from recent acts in Congress and by the administration.”

“The challenge right now is from the federal government” which has “reduced and curtailed tax credits available to the solar and storage industries” and is “likely to decrease the amount of supply that comes online,” Gallagher said.

New Energy Landscape

Renewables helped make Texas’ grid more stable in the summer, but there’s still concern for the winter because “the Trump administration has responded by just completely making it so difficult to add more energy to the grid,” saidHannah Malus, vice president of strategy and advocacy at Clean Energy for America.

“The lives and livelihoods of Texans are just collateral damage resulting from this administration picking winners and losers and energy sources instead of just letting the market decide,” Malus said.

Wind and solar generation have been the fastest-growing sources of electricity in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas system—which maintains the state’s electric grid—since 2023 and are increasingly meeting rising demand, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

For example, from June 1 to Aug. 31, solar met 15.2% of all demand in the ERCOT system, according to the council’s data.

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.

Harris County—Texas’ largest county and home to Houston—in October sued the Environmental Protection Agency for canceling $250 million it was awarded to fund solar energy infrastructure in low-income communities. Other states and organizations have also filed challenges over the Solar For All program.

“The whole purpose of the grant is to lower skyrocketing energy costs, to create clean energy jobs, to improve community health safety and resilience, and, of course, to support domestic manufacturing,” said Christian Menefee, Harris County’s chief civil lawyer.

The county on Oct. 24 moved for a preliminary injunction to stop the EPA from implementing the cancellation of the program. The section of the July tax and spending bill that rescinds “unobligated balances” violates the Administrative Procedure Act and US Constitution, the motion said.

“I agree with the overall sentiment that this sector is poised to continue growing, but I think you’d have to be a bit foolish to think that that growth won’t be slowed or stunted because of the actions of the Trump administration,” Menefee said.

The EPA said it doesn’t comment on pending litigation since Solar For All is the subject of different lawsuits. The Energy Department and ERCOT didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

ERCOT’s CEO, Pablo Vegas, testified before Congress in March about the grid.

“A reliable grid must have a balanced mix of generation resources, especially with the ‘all of the above’ approach” found in Texas, he said.

Texas Resiliency

Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.

“ERCOT is mostly isolated from other grids in the country, and that means that Texas has more autonomy on how the market is designed and operated,” Boms said. This allows the state to avoid lengthy oversight processes from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the interstate transmission of gas and electricity.

The state’s infrastructure also plays a big role.

“There was a really important transmission build out that happened about 20 years ago to connect remote wind and solar projects to the urban hubs in Texas,” Boms said. That “allowed billions of dollars in private investment to flow into Texas because the transmission was in place.”

“Federal policies will have an impact, but generally speaking, the industry is here to stay, and it’s really up to state leadership,” he said.

There have been recent attempts in the state legislature to pass bills that would add obstacles for renewables, but they didn’t go far.

One Republican-led bill, SB 819, would have added new permit requirements on wind and solar generating facilities, according to law firm K&L Gates.

Another, SB 715—also led by state Republicans—would have moved up the effective dates of new generation reliability requirements, according to S&P Global.

“There have been threats over the last few legislative sessions and some anti-renewable proposals, but luckily, none of those have passed,” Boms said.

Texas also invested in stronger weatherization following Winter Storm Uri in 2021, which left about 4.5 million Texans without electricity during extremely low temperatures.

FERC and the North American Electric Reliability Corp. released a report the same year finding that natural gas-fired units represented 58% of all generating units experiencing unplanned outages and other issues at that time. Wind made up 27%, coal made up 6%, and solar made up 2%.

“I think that these technologies—wind, solar, storage, demand response—they’re not experiments anymore,” Boms said. “They’re the backbone of the Texas grid and the economy.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/ad4fbd2/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2d%2F63%2F179975d947c3bd49ff759c5d1216%2Fgettyimages-1303397752.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 13:09:01.119136

This sustainable solution is called Soleolico, which is the world’s first hybrid generator that is responsible for producing wind and solar power while absorbing CO₂ at the same time. According to Carlos Serrada, president and founder of Soleolico, the wind turbine that absorbs CO₂ was the result of many people working and researching together.

A combination of wind and solar power in an absorbing gadget

Soleolico is a vertical-axis turbine that operates silently at seven revolutions per minute. This wind and solar solution is a wildlife-friendly design that is meant to reduce noise pollution. The Soleolico can be installed in all areas, including heavily populated areas.

Wind can be captured from all directions as the turbine has a magnetic blade guidance system. The good news is that this turbine can result in 25% higher performance when compared to the more traditional turbines. While harnessing the power of the wind, solar integration ensures constant power generation.

During the day, the embedded solar cells are able to gain energy directly from the sun, and the wind turbine aspect ensures that power is generated at night and when the sun doesn’t shine. The system is thus able to generate power 24/7 with further support from advanced battery storage.

A generator that works to absorb CO₂ from the air, too

While Soleolico is well known for its 7,5 kW capacity that enables the generator to power homes, offices, and the community at large, the best feature of the Soleolico is that it features an air-purifying surface. The tower and the sails are coated with 3-D printed material that absorbs CO₂ and transforms it into harmless byproducts.

The 3-D printed material was developed by LaMáquina using Pure. Tech technology to absorb the CO₂. As has been said by the director of Pure. Tech, installing 1,000 units of Soleolico would result in the absorption of as much CO₂ as 287 trees in just a year. The design can be customized by 3-D printing so as to effortlessly blend into an environment.

Soleolico called the first-ever technological tree

Soleolico achieved quite a name for itself, being called the first-ever technological tree. In fact, the term “technological tree” was given by Serrada. The feat for Serrada is that the Soleolico can even work in the park, producing clean air whilst ridding the Earth of CO₂. While vertical wind turbines are always set to beat solar panels, the Soleolico ensures that a wind generator can work alongside solar panels.

One of the reasons why Soleolico is so valued is that it can coexist in all settings. Soleolico’s versatility is another reason why it is such an impressive generator.

Stepping closer to a cleaner power future

Serrada’s company has a goal to capture 1% of the global renewable energy market over the next decade. To reach this ambitious goal, the company will have to produce 3 million Soleolico units while generating over €100 billion in revenue. To achieve this goal, Soleolico will build its first manufacturing facility in Spain while expanding on partnerships in all regions.

Production capacity is set to exceed 25,000 units per month, with the company planning for the generator to be located all over cities. Soleolico has come in at the right time, offering some hope for a cleaner planet. This combination of wind, sun, and technology is reimagining what renewable power could mean for us. When wind meets solar in a wild fusion, the results are quite amazing, and Soleolico proves this.

However, that reality may be coming to an end soon, as the Baltic Industrial Group, a Polish manufacturer of onshore wind towers, has recently announced a strategic partnership with Vensys Energy, a German wind tower component manufacturing company, to supply onshore wind towers in a new pan-European contract that not only boosts the wind power sector, but also enables Europe to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuel energy generation towards the renewable energy sector.

Under the new partnership, the Baltic Industrial Group will supply wind towers to several European nations

For far too long, the world has stagnated in its embrace of the wind power sector while solar and nuclear hold the torch for the renewable energy industry. The global community has been contemplating the best form of energy production that does not harm the environment. Our continued reliance on fossil fuels has devastated the world and resulted in significant climate change.

The new strategic partnership between two of the world’s leading wind power companies will supply essential components for wind tower manufacturing across several European nations.

The Baltic Industrial Group will manufacture five towers for a new wind power project in the United Kingdom, along with seven towers headed for new wind projects in France, Poland, and Germany.

The group will also supply essential components for a project in Portugal

The group has also noted that it will supply five ESC sections for a new wind power project in Portugal. These exemplify the group’s expertise in the wind manufacturing sector, as these components are exceedingly complicated and require expert levels of engineering ability.

“For us, the cooperation with VENSYS is not only a new contract, but also a strategic step towards further development in the renewable energy sector. Our goal is for the towers built in Gdańsk to operate throughout Europe – from the Atlantic coast to the southern regions of the continent. This proves that the Baltic Industrial Group is ready to implement the most demanding projects in the renewable energy sector.” – Remigiusz Paszkiewicz, President of the Management Board of the Baltic Industrial Group

Europe’s cooperative dialogue between companies has boosted the appeal of the wind power sector

With the exceedingly cold European winter approaching, many European nations are turning to the renewable energy sector to increase energy supply to alleviate concerns over increasing demand.

The strategic partnership between the Baltic Industrial Group and VENSYS, which should be noted, is based in Germany but owned by China, and will complete the delivery in several phases. The new partnership covers the entire process, from designing the wind towers with a specialized team from VENSYS, manufacturing of said wind towers, and developing efficient transport logistics.

The wind power sector has seen tremendous growth in Europe as of late, with MingYang, a Chinese wind turbine manufacturer, unveiling its plans to enter the European wind energy sector in the next few years. This points to a new future where wind will be embraced by the powers that be on the continent.

Suddenly, automakers do not have to manufacture electric vehicles, which they have struggled to make profitably.
Those policy changes are slowing the transition to electric vehicles.
But executives are also consistently saying they still plan to invest in electric vehicles.
Partly, that's because of competitive pressure, as Chinese automakers make increasingly attractive and affordable electric vehicles.","Automakers have been footing a hefty tariff bill — to the tune of $30 billion across the industry this year, according to a recent analysis from Moody's.

The industry is also grappling with a shortage of semiconductors, leaving them without the chips they need to build some vehicles, as well as a fire at an aluminum plant that's hurting the supply chain for Ford and Stellantis.

Despite those headwinds, quarterly earnings reports from automakers are so far showing resilience. General Motors reported $3.4 billion in profits last quarter and Ford brought in $2.6 billion, both beating expectations. Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, increased its revenues by 13% year over year. Hyundai, despite seeing a 29% decline in profits compared to the same quarter last year, still plans to meet its targets for the year.

Volkswagen Group, on the other hand, reported a more than billion-dollar loss, as it faced the combined costs of tariffs and Porsche's pivot from electric vehicles back to gasoline.

Part of the reason for automakers' positive reports is that Trump lowered tariffs on goods from Japan and Europe from 25% to 15%, and just recently announced a similar deal with Korea. While a 15% tariff is still substantial, the changes were welcomed by automakers.

Meanwhile, a recent policy change eased the burden of tariffs on imported parts that go into U.S.-built cars.

Automakers' bottom lines are also getting a boost from rising car prices. Companies have been cautious about passing tariff costs along to consumers, in part because cars are already so expensive — over $50,000 on average, according to Kelley Blue Book. There are real questions about how much more consumers are willing or able to pay. But gradual increases are now visible. Across the industry, prices are up about .5% this year, Ford says.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration's rollback of environmental rules is benefitting some automakers substantially — in particular, changes to emissions requirements that used to penalize automakers if they made too many high-polluting vehicles.

Suddenly, automakers do not have to manufacture electric vehicles, which they have struggled to make profitably. And they can build as many large pickup trucks as they can sell — which are both more polluting and more profitable. That's been a boost to companies like GM, Stellantis and Ford, offsetting the costs of tariffs.

Of course, that same policy change is a setback for all-electric automakers like Tesla and Rivian. Under the previous rules, automakers that wanted to make gas guzzlers could pay EV manufacturers for ""regulatory credits,"" allowing them to borrow their rivals' green halos — and comply with federal rules. Now, that revenue stream for EV makers is being eliminated.

Tesla had strong sales last quarter, helped by the rush to buy EVs as consumers tried to take advantage of the now-eliminated consumer EV tax credit. But profits fell. (On Tesla's quarterly call with investors, Musk, as usual, was less interested in talking about those EV sales and much more interested in talking about the humanoid robots that he plans to sell.) Rivian is expected to report earnings next week.

Those policy changes are slowing the transition to electric vehicles. GM is ending production of its electric commercial van, and Stellantis is leaning heavily into inefficient Hemi engines, as a new CEO pivots away from a previous focus on electrification.

But executives are also consistently saying they still plan to invest in electric vehicles. ""EVs remain our North Star,"" said Mary Barra, explaining that GM will continue to work on improved EV batteries.

Partly, that's because of competitive pressure, as Chinese automakers make increasingly attractive and affordable electric vehicles. But automakers also know that just as the Trump administration did a U-turn on EVs, a future administration might once again make climate change and air pollution major priorities.

""We expect adoption will increase over time and the market [will] continue to evolve — and maybe even regulations evolve,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley told investors.

So Ford still plans to move forward with a $30,000 electric pickup, despite the lack of federal tax credits or regulations that would encourage it. ""We think this product is literally at the center of the future of the EV market in the U.S.,"" Farley said.

Their goal is to power the entire farmers market, and eventually, Purdue, with sustainable energy.
“If the roof of every building on Purdue campus is covered with solar panels, we can produce most of the energy, if not all, to run the campus,” Kudinov said.
“I wish people knew how feasible (sustainable energy) is,” said Eddie Petrenko, the operations manager for the club.
The SEC welcomes people from every field to learn more about sustainable energy and get hands-on with the processes.","Thursday marked the end of the West Lafayette Farmers Market for the season, but for the Sustainability Energy Club at Purdue, the day was just a beginning for a more sustainable future.

Founded last spring semester, the SEC is a club made up of mostly freshmen, but the spirit of its members more than makes up for their lack of experience. Being the only club at Purdue advocating for sustainable energy, their mission is to educate people and to make a bigger push for sustainable energy at Purdue.

The SEC set up eight pairs of solar panels central to the farmers market, each one generating power for one tent at the market: KNOW Eatery, a vegan restaurant with an emphasis on sustainability consciousness.

But KNOW Eatery is only the start for the SEC. Their goal is to power the entire farmers market, and eventually, Purdue, with sustainable energy.

Andrei Kudinov, a junior in mechanical engineering, is co-president of the club.

“If the roof of every building on Purdue campus is covered with solar panels, we can produce most of the energy, if not all, to run the campus,” Kudinov said. “With just this array, in one hour, we'll probably save six pounds of carbon emissions.”

While the goal of a fully sustainable energy-run campus is far away, the members of the SEC work on smaller projects that make a big impact around campus.

The SEC is planning on implementing wind turbines on campus during the winter months, a time when it’s not as sunny for solar panels to be effective. The SEC also does research with Hydroponics, plants that are grown without soil, as research for plant growth in space.

Another project that the SEC is working on is a DC house, or a house that is run completely off of solar power. The DC house, located near Armstrong, will help the club research energy savings with their own data and observations.

“We're starting off small, but it's the first step in creating bigger projects that help the community,” said Alexis Fornero, a member of the SEC’s fundamentals branch and a sophomore in civil engineering. “Even just powering one booth at the farmers market is taking that first step.”

One of the SEC’s goals is to educate people on how simple and accessible sustainable energy can be.

“I wish people knew how feasible (sustainable energy) is,” said Eddie Petrenko, the operations manager for the club. “Everything we got here was ordered off Amazon. The solar panels are $60, and we trained a bunch of freshmen to set them up in a few weeks.”

In educating people about sustainable energy, the SEC combats stigmas that many people hold towards clean energy, which especially affects nuclear energy.

The SEC also works to influence Purdue’s plan, or lack thereof, for sustainability.

“Our poly branch is working on a climate action plan for Purdue, because we're the only Big 10 school that doesn't have one,” said Abhitej Kanuri, the SEC secretary. “That’s one of the big focuses right now.”

But the main focus of the SEC rests in the future.

“There's a huge cultural and business shift right now,” Kanuri said. “Sustainable and renewable energy is going to be the future. When technology is at the point where sustainable energy is the most important form of energy, Purdue needs to have systems in place to produce engineers who know how to work with that kind of energy.”

The impending shift towards sustainable energy has piqued the interest of many students at Purdue, which is something that excites the members of the SEC. The SEC welcomes people from every field to learn more about sustainable energy and get hands-on with the processes.

“Anybody can join, you don't have to know anything,” said Sammie Van Hoose, an FYE student and outreach coordinator for SEC. “You don't need any experience; you can learn something and help out the community. It’s simpler than it looks.”

The enthusiasm of the members themselves also acts as a motivator for the club to continue its hard work and dedication to implementing sustainable energy at Purdue.

“It's easy to stay positive when we are seeing so much of a positive impact from our work,” Van Hoose said. “We have a lot of people that, because of their hard work, we're able to see our impact firsthand, and we get a lot of positive results. A lot of our members are very passionate about this.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/purdueexponent.org/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/09/409bdcac-f4f5-4166-9373-47eaf9e3190d/6904c819b1c60.preview.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-31 11:26:43.884181
,Indiana and Evs,2025-10-31 14:51:15+00:00,The Daily Reporter - Greenfield Indiana,"Fast chargers are expanding quickly, but American EV drivers still fear running out of juice",The Associated Press,,,,,https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/2025/10/31/fast-chargers-are-expanding-quickly-but-american-ev-drivers-still-fear-running-out-of-juice/,"KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle.
Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply.
But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.","KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn’t buy an EV. That’s significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That’s a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans’ anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that’s long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut’s state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He’s taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

LAS VEGAS (Oct. 31, 2025) – Pushing the limits of electric vehicle performance, Toyota will debut its first-ever battery-electric SEMA concept build with the bZ Time Attack Concept at the 2025 SEMA Show—a purpose-built, BEV machine engineered to take on both time attack circuits and hill climbs.

Designed to explore the performance potential of Toyota’s BEV technology, this vehicle showcases competition aerodynamics, motorsports-grade suspension and engineering, and a significant increase in all-electric horsepower over stock.

The concept begins with a strong foundation: the 26MY AWD bZ, which already delivers 338 horsepower and a 0–60 mph time of just 4.9 seconds in showroom form. Looking ahead, Toyota is also expanding its all-electric lineup with an all-new bZ model arriving for the 2026 model year, bringing improved range, power, and charging capabilities. In addition, Toyota will introduce two all-new BEVs in 2026—the bZ Woodland and the C-HR—further broadening customer choice and underscoring the company’s commitment to electrified performance and innovation.

“This year at SEMA, we wanted to push ourselves into unexplored territory,” said Marty Schwerter, lead builder and director of operations at Toyota’s Motorsports Technical Center. “It’s a chance to explore, learn, and create something that shows just how much potential exists within Toyota’s BEV platforms.”

Schwerter and his Toyota Motorsports Garage team have collaborated on standout Toyota SEMA builds for more than two decades. Still, the bZ Time Attack Concept presented several unique challenges, from balancing battery performance with weight distribution to designing an aggressive widebody and aero package suited for motorsports. Unlike conventional builds, the team had to rethink how aerodynamics and fitment could be achieved on an EV platform, while helping to provide safety and durability under extreme conditions.

“The goal wasn’t to simply create a showpiece—It was to see how far the new bZ platform could be pushed in a motorsport setting,” said Schwerter. “And that meant that we had to tackle the two biggest hurdles for any electric competition car: battery performance and aerodynamic integration.”

Packaging a widebody and full aero suite onto an EV chassis presented challenges not found in conventional builds, driving the team to rethink everything from airflow management to cooling strategies.

The solution came through a hybridized approach to fabrication. Toyota R&D, TRD, and a network of advanced suppliers combined laser scanning, CAD development, and large-scale 3D printing to bring the design to life. Fender arches were digitally modeled, printed at full scale, then hand-finished for strength and precision. Key to this process was Toyota’s Add Lab in Georgetown, Kentucky— led by Sr. Engineering Manager Greg Stewart and Additive Manufacturing Engineer Dallas Martin— whose rapid prototyping capabilities gave R&D the flexibility to hit tight deadlines. This method drastically cut prototyping time, allowing for rapid iterations of the one-off widebody and aero system.

The result: a car lowered a whopping six inches from stock ride height, with massive six-inch track increase and a fully integrated aero package including rear wing, side skirts, front splitter, and rear diffuser.

Under the skin, the bZ Time Attack Concept starts with a 2026 Toyota bZ AWD platform. Power delivery to all four wheels comes from Toyota R&D-tuned electric motors delivering over 300 kW (400+ hp), managed through bespoke ECU calibration. TEIN coilovers and springs suspend the chassis, while drastically improved braking performance comes by way of an Alcon system with Hawk pads adapted from Toyota’s 86 Cup and Corolla TC race programs. A full FIA-spec 4130 chromoly cage stiffens the chassis, while the interior is fitted with OMP HTE-R racing seats and OMP harnesses. The chassis rolls on 19×11-inch BBS Unlimited wheels shod with huge 305/30ZR19 XL Continental Extreme Contact Sport 02 tires, adding substantial mechanical grip to go along with the impressive aerodynamic downforce.

Every aspect of the build reflects Toyota’s willingness to experiment with nontraditional fabrication methods. The bodywork, finished in a custom PPG pearl/metallic white, metallic black, and red tri-color scheme, demonstrates what happens when additive manufacturing and traditional race-car craftsmanship intersect. From CAD modeling at Dark Matter Laser Works to the 3D-printed components produced by Toyota’s Add Lab, the project embodies a new way of thinking about concept-to-competition builds. For Toyota, the bZ Time Attack Concept isn’t just a concept car—it’s a rolling test bed for the next generation of EV motorsport development.

“Every SEMA build challenges Toyota’s engineering and design teams to outdo themselves from the year before,” said Mike Tripp, group vice president, Toyota Marketing. “With the bZ Time Attack Concept, the challenge was greater than ever: transforming an all-electric Toyota vehicle into motorsport reality. The bZ Time Attack Concept is not only a striking visual concept but also a serious performance contender.”

The bZ Time Attack Concept will be on display at the 2025 SEMA Show from November 4-7 at the Las Vegas Convention Center in the Toyota booth (Central Hall, Booth 22200). The concept is just one of over two dozen displays in support of this year’s display theme: Powered by Possibility, where Toyota celebrates innovation with a build for every powertrain, including gasoline internal combustion (ICE), BEV, hybrid (HEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and Fuel Cell Electric (FCEV). Attendees are invited to visit Toyota’s booth to experience this innovative concept build up close and discover how Toyota continues to imagine what could come next.

The utility plans to replace two aging coal-fired units with a pair of advanced combined-cycle natural gas units. The proposed investment is approximately US $3.3 billion, plus financing and contingency costs. Construction is slated for completion of the first gas unit by 2029 and the second by 2030, enabling retirement of the coal units thereafter. The move addresses growing electricity demand in the region and aligns with regulatory filings citing generation shortfall risks.

Project Factsheet

Utility: Duke Energy Indiana

Location: Cayuga Generating Station, Vermillion County, Indiana

Investment: $3.3 billion (plus financing costs)

New capacity: Adds ~470 MW to existing ~1,005 MW at the facility

Future of coal units: Study on third-party operation; retirement scheduled 2029–2030

Ratepayer impact: First tracker adds ~$1.87/month; watchdog predicts up to ~$19.37 /month

Significance of the Project

From a construction-industry perspective, this conversion offers a vast and complex project pipeline: demolition of coal-steam infrastructure, heavy civil works for new foundations, erection of combustion turbines, installation of heat-recovery steam generators, and integration of modern utility systems. Similarly, the Samsung Engineering America low-carbon ammonia plant in Indiana, reflects growing investment in clean-energy and decarbonization projects that demand advanced engineering and construction expertise. According to project documents, the capacity increase is about 471 MW over the retiring units, meaning large structural, mechanical and electrical scopes. Moreover, the project’s regulatory context introduces cost-recovery mechanisms such as construction-work-in-progress ratemaking, which has implications for contractor project-phasing and financing.

The settlement with coal-industry stakeholders has also required a feasibility study for third-party operation of existing coal units, a novel approach that underscores the layered planning and stakeholder-management complexity. Finally, the heavy-industry nature of the work (power-plant scale) elevates opportunities for mechanical contractors, heavy-lift logistics firms, structural steel fabricators and specialist trade subcontractors, particularly those capable of working in large-site, high-specification energy-transition projects.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Project-16.avif,N,,2025-10-31 16:05:10.808616

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour.
Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the United States.
Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield, Conn., resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.","Kent, Conn. — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn't buy an EV. That's significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That's a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans' anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Worries remain on charging

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the United States.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that's long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut's state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Car price still top barrier

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield, Conn., resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He's taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile range per charge, on a 400-mile trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time, I just drove normally and had no problem.”

The bill that cleared the General Assembly Thursday funds energy storage systems through a new charge to Illinois electric customers that will take effect in 2030. The bill also lifts a longtime ban on new nuclear power developments and gives new authority to state utility regulators.

Proponents say the bill will lower costs for utility customers, but critics worry that a lack of cost-control measures will increase electricity prices for Illinois residents.

“Here’s the bottom line in my view: this package is about making energy more affordable for ratepayers in years ahead. We’re getting more energy on the grid,” bill sponsor Sen. Steve Stadelman, D-Rockford, said Thursday. “If we do nothing… the rates are going to continue to go up.”

The Illinois Senate approved Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — Thursday evening, 37-22. That follows the House of Representatives approving it Wednesday night, 70-37.

It next heads to Gov. JB Pritzker, who pledged to sign the bill Thursday, noting that “what we’re trying to do is lower electricity costs.”

Pritzker’s office was heavily involved in negotiations around the bill throughout its tumultuous legislative history.

Versions of the bill date back to negotiations in 2024, with initial talks of an energy package cropping up in the weeks ahead of a January 2025 lame duck session. Drafts of the bill circulated throughout the spring legislative session before ultimately being abandoned.

Renewable industry, environmentalists celebrate

A cadre of advocacy groups, renewable industry associations and lawmakers praised the bill’s passage.

The governor said the bill was a positive step toward affordability at a time when renewable energy faces expensive headwinds across the U.S.

“For far too long, private grid operators have been hiking up rates that are making it harder for Illinois families to pay their utility bills,” Pritzker said in a statement. “At the same time, the Trump Administration has been blocking the ability to bring lower-cost energy options online.”

President Donald Trump’s domestic policy package, passed earlier this summer, sent shockwaves through the renewable industry as it ended subsidies and incentives for electric vehicles, wind power projects, solar installation and other policies key to funding renewable development.

David Braun, head of sales and marketing for the Illinois-based renewable tech company Intelligent Generation, said that law caused “a lot of shock and uncertainty” but that the industry was “figuring it out.”

Illinois’ bill, according to Braun, signals that the future is bright for renewables.

“It’s good news for the industry, and I think it’s good news for the state of Illinois and for ratepayers,” Braun said.

The bill incentivizes new storage projects, which state officials at the Illinois Power Agency found will suppress electricity prices in an analysis they provided to lawmakers. It also mandates new programs to decrease strain on the grid, like energy efficiency programs.

Amy Heart, senior vice president for policy at the California-based solar company Sunrun, said the bill’s “virtual power plant” program will allow utilities to aggregate resources like residential solar and storage installations and coordinate them.

“The idea of utilizing electrons that are already stored in the batteries that are in houses and businesses — but adding them all up and dispatching them at times we need them the most in Illinois — reduces the amount of energy that ComEd or Ameren has to go to the wholesale market and buy from other states,” Heart said.

Environmental groups also praised the bill, with representatives of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and others saying the policy was a major step in keeping prices low.

“The legislation bolsters tools and programs the state needs to achieve its clean energy goals and rebukes recent federal efforts to undermine abundant, cost-effective wind and solar power,” James Gignac, Midwest policy director for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement.

After a prolonged negotiation, labor groups also signed on to support the bill. They held out full support until lawmakers moved to close a loophole that allowed community solar developers to avoid using project labor agreements. Joe Duffy, head of the labor-affiliated Climate Jobs Illinois, lauded the bill’s passage. He noted that it “ensures the clean energy transition delivers good-paying, local union jobs.”

Criticism from Republicans, business groups

While affordability was at the center of proponents’ commendations of the policy, it was also central to critics’ attacks. The bill’s energy storage funding mechanism will put a guaranteed increase to Illinois consumers’ utility bills, which sparked significant opposition from Republicans, business groups and some Democrats.

Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, broke with his party as one of three Senate Democrats to vote against the bill. Sen. Michael Hastings, D-Frankfort, and Sen. Patrick Joyce, D-Essex, also voted no.

“This is about standing for integrity, for people who do not have armies of lobbyists down here giving talking points to people to justify raising their bills when they’re already struggling,” Preston said. “I have to vote no.”

Preston had advocated for an alternative funding mechanism — one that used state-backed loans and not an increase to ratepayers — in the months leading up to the bill’s passage.

Groups representing large businesses cited similar concerns. Illinois Industrial Electric Consumers Chair Phillip Golden said the bill’s funding “makes no sense, especially when the same objectives are achievable without forcing more costs on ratepayers.”

Business groups and Republicans also raised concerns over a provision that grants the Illinois Commerce Commission, which regulates utilities, the authority to create long-term “integrated resource plans.” These plans could include goals for the supply of electricity and managing demand.

By giving the ICC that authority, according to critics, the General Assembly is ceding too much authority to the executive branch.

“This is a huge overreach by the governor’s administration,” Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, said. “In this bill, he just gave all of the power for energy making decisions to the ICC — five unelected officials that he appoints.”

Rezin, a long-time advocate for allowing more nuclear construction in the state, said the bill’s elimination of the state’s nuclear moratorium might not mean more nuclear power because of the authority granted to the governor’s appointees.

“Do you think they’re going to bring nuclear online? In the past, they’ve shown they don’t support it,” Rezin said. “They’re going to go towards wind, solar, battery and transmission.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-10/251030-solar-aa.jpg?h=0caf38e4&itok=bD7VSwKJ,N,,2025-10-31 12:09:24.698660

The gasifier will use coal and petroleum coke — an oil refining byproduct — as feedstock, according to a project summary.

The DOE’s loan was for $1.559 billion.

A panoply of political and business leaders celebrated the announcement, including Indiana Gov. Mike Braun.

“Wabash Valley Resources is putting America first — transforming an idle fossil energy plant into a fertilizer engine that strengthens our farmers, bolsters energy independence, and revitalizes coal country,” he said. “This is the kind of vision and leadership we need to compete globally.”

The company’s CEO, Dan Williams, called the project “more than an investment.”

“It’s a new chapter for a world-class facility and the community that built it,” he said. The project is “restoring good-paying jobs and proving that rural Indiana can help lead America’s clean energy future.”

Williams also praised organized labor, “whose skill and professionalism will bring this vision to life.”

But groups of Hoosier landowners and other opponents denounced the project as a “scam.”

“It is shameful that this administration would hand out $1.5 billion to a privately owned, Korean-backed corporation during a shutdown when everyday people can’t receive basic government services and government employees go unpaid. That is not the American way,” Janet Cianteo, a member of the Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources and Indiana Action Team.

Korean firms Hanwha Asset Management and Korea Investment Real Asset Management have invested in Wabash Valley Resources, and the Korean government has also been involved, according to the company’s news release.

“This company and its foreign partners will be hard pressed to ever have majority support in our community,” Cianteo said. “We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting Hoosier land and lives from this dangerous scheme.”

The Indiana Action Team is part of the Nebraska-based Bold Alliance, best known for its opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline extension.

“It is disgraceful that this project is being foisted on Hoosiers with the backing of our government and our public money,” said Emma Schmit, the Bold Alliance’s pipeline fighters director. “Enough is enough. We should not have to sacrifice our property rights or take on the risks of a proven-to-fail technology so Wabash Valley Resources’ investors can afford another private island.”

But it’s one thing to complain about costs. What can candidates actually do to rein in electricity prices once they’re in a position to govern? A new study from the state’s utilities commission offers a road map for Virginia officials post-election.

Polls generally show Democrats poised to win a trifecta in Richmond, with former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D) favored to replace Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), who is limited to one term, and Democrats likely to retain a majority in the House of Delegates. The party already narrowly controls the state’s upper chamber, where senators are on a four-year cycle that ends in 2027.

Still, the new analysis suggests that winning could be the easy part for whoever prevails Nov. 4. Tamping down electricity prices and decarbonizing in the face of unprecedented demand growth in the world’s data-center capital will be a much more complicated task.

“An affordability challenge is building”

Mandated by a 2024 bipartisan resolution from the General Assembly, the 93-page document was commissioned by utility regulators and conducted by consultants Great Plains Institute and Current Energy Group.

“Although Virginia electricity rates have historically been competitive and relatively low,” the authors write, ​“an affordability challenge is building and looms larger in the years ahead.” Virginians served by the state’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, may be hit particularly hard: the company predicts expenditures to grow a whopping 68% before decade’s end.

“Additional factors will determine the ultimate rates and total bills paid by customers,” the report says, ​“but in general, the forecasted increase in capital expenditures will be directly borne by customers as a commensurate increase to their electricity bill.”

The problem isn’t so much the so-called ​“base rates,” the core per-kilowatt-hour charges that are heavily scrutinized by the utilities commission in exhaustive proceedings, the researchers suggest. Those are mostly stable for now and expected to creep up modestly.

Instead, the analysis shows bills are spiking largely because of a host of add-ons for natural-gas fuel and other expenses. These ​“riders” typically aren’t subjected to the same dissection from regulators and now make up more than half of the monthly electric costs for the average residential utility consumer.

Utilities often tout their relatively low base rates, said Kendl Kobbervig, advocacy and communications director for the nonprofit Clean Virginia. ​“But average customers do not pay rates. They pay bills — that’s what they’re getting in the mail every month.”

In Dominion territory in northern and eastern Virginia, rider prices jumped 27% between 2021 and 2024, according to the report. In the state’s southwest corner, Appalachian Power customers saw even steeper hikes of 63% in the same period, including an eye-popping doubling of fuel charges.

“Weekly, I hear from constituents about $250, $500, $1000, even $2000 monthly energy bills,” Delegate Sam Rasoul, a Democrat running for reelection in Roanoke, part of Appalachian Power territory, wrote on social media. ​“This is a nonpartisan issue — lower the damn bills!”

Indeed, Republican Delegate Jason Ballard, who represents a New River Valley district to the west, also cited the high cost of Appalachian Power bills online, writing, ​“Energy costs are one of the biggest burdens on Virginia families and we’ve been working hard to bring relief.”

Ballard touted an announcement from Appalachian Power that it will lower fuel costs by almost a quarter starting Nov. 1 — undoubted relief for customers who pay 100% of the utility’s expenses for coal, natural gas, and the like.

But analysts propose to change the rate rollercoaster for consumers by requiring Appalachian Power and Dominion to take on some portion of those fuel costs.

Under the current regime, ​“the utility doesn’t have an incentive to responsibly manage fuel — there’s no incentive for efficiency,” Kobbervig said. ​“It also means the utility doesn’t have an incentive to transition away from fuel-based resources to things like solar and wind.”

Like many of the proposals in the report, fuel-cost sharing would need a green light from the General Assembly to move forward. Promoting it is a key legislative priority for Clean Virginia.

“That is directly at the nexus of clean energy and affordability policy,” Kobbervig said.

“A strong path to pursue immediately”

Fuel costs aren’t the only pass-throughs that researchers recommend constraining. Other riders, aka rate-adjustment clauses, are getting out of hand, the authors say, especially for Dominion Energy. And unlike fuel costs, utilities tend to earn a profit on these rider expenses, such as the cost of building renewable energy to comply with the state’s 2020 decarbonization law.

“This creates a ​‘best of both worlds’ scenario for utility cost recovery and earning,” the analysis says, in which utilities can pass on expenses with less regulatory examination and still earn a profit on them.

While the legislature reduced the number of rate-adjustment clauses in 2023, the study concludes that further refinement is needed. ​“Significant improvement opportunities remain,” the authors write.

To restrain costs in the face of unprecedented demand growth, analysts also suggest a new paradigm for building power plants. Currently, the process is utility-led and technology specific: Dominion proposes set amounts of gas-fired plants, solar farms, and other energy sources to supply electricity to data centers and other customers in its long-term plans, followed up by permit applications for certain plants.

For instance, the report notes, in Dominion’s bid to build the controversial Chesterfield gas complex outside of Richmond, it expressly stated that ​“solar wind, and energy storage resources will not be considered.”

In the proposed paradigm, called ​“all-source competitive procurement,” the utility would ask for bids from a variety of different power producers to fulfill a specific need, then select the cheapest proposal that also ensures reliability.

“Virginia will likely need to add significant new generation and capacity in the years ahead to address growing load forecasts and support economic development in the state,” the report says. ​“Such resource additions, however, should not come at the expense of ratepayer affordability.”

“Utilities are not always incentivized to prioritize operational solutions like energy efficiency or cheaper energy alternatives,” said Kajsa Foskey, director of the Virginia Energy Consumer Alliance. ​“The recommendations around competitive all-source procurement would be a strong path to pursue immediately” in the General Assembly, she said.

A one-time legislative aide in the House of Delegates, Foskey believes the new blueprint will be vital in educating part-time lawmakers who meet for only two months next year, starting in mid-January, so that they can hit the ground running. The document was vetted by a host of stakeholders, including many of the alliance’s consumer, environmental, and justice-oriented member groups.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1187455283.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=3f5d87b45de19f0958a3719ef1c417f7,N,,2025-10-31 15:19:26.153119

Politicians and members of the community gathered for the ceremony at the site of the data center, on the Energy Way Industrial Park.

The cloud and e-commerce giant announced its plan for a $10 billion investment in digital infrastructure in North Carolina earlier this year, without going into specifics of the project.

It is expected that the data center campus will feature up to 20 buildings at full build-out, each of which is likely to span more than 200,000 sq ft (18,580 sqm).

The data center will be located near the Sherwood H Smith Jr energy complex, a power plant operated by Duke Energy producing more than 2.24GW of output via natural gas turbines. It has not been revealed how the data center will be powered, what its eventual capacity will be, or when it might open.

Amazon has promised the development will create 500 permanent jobs. The company could receive tax breaks from Richmond County in the form of a 50 percent property tax reduction and a 65 percent personal property tax relief over a 20-year period, but has not received any state incentives from North Carolina.

(AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle.
Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply.
But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.","KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn’t buy an EV. That’s significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That’s a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans’ anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that’s long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut’s state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He’s taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

The places that were vulnerable to begin with, of course, are going to be even more vulnerable from the threats of climate change…. So the vulnerability is not accidental. It’s just like what we found in toxic waste and race. It is by design. And if you want to unpack that, if you want to make communities safer, you’ve got to go back to the source. And the source is residential segregation.”

Abre’ Conner: “What the future of this work needs to look like is having folks who are doing work in policy, advocacy, mobilization, research in academia, or traditional organizers and activists…. Communications, for sure, has been a major factor in how we’ve been able to shift the narrative…by highlighting this in the media and shaming a lot of these tech companies for what they’re doing, but [we need] to have all of those components working together in an intersectional way to amplify that we’re going to put up a united front.”",https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/2025-10/OHO_Environmental_Justice_Initiative_Launch_02.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 10:59:58.978646

,Texas American Energy ,2025-10-31 14:10:55+00:00,www.enlit.world,What Spain's blackout means for the US grid and its energy storage future | Enlit World,Not Available,,,,,https://www.enlit.world/library/what-spains-blackout-means-for-the-us-grid-and-its-energy-storage-future,"Distributed energy storage systems emerge as a critical solution in this strategy.
Long duration storage Spain’s blackout exposed a critical gap: even fast-response storage and renewable generation can’t maintain grid stability over prolonged disruption.
Instead, traditional energy storage systems are stepping up, delivering real, high-impact resilience across US grids right now.
Charting a resilient energy future The Iberian blackout serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in modern power grids.
This transformation requires a diversified approach that builds on proven technologies like battery energy storage systems and taps into underutilised assets like hydropower to provide dependable, dispatchable support.","On April 28, 2025, the sudden and massive blackout that plunged Spain and Portugal into darkness disrupted daily life across the Iberian Peninsula, as within five seconds, the region lost approximately 15GW of power, accounting for about 60% of its electricity supply.

This rapid cascade was triggered by voltage surges and inadequate grid planning, leading to a chain reaction of disconnections that overwhelmed its systems. The April 28 blackout across Spain and Portugal sent more than just homes into darkness; it sent a warning to grid operators around the world.

As electricity demand spikes and renewable integration accelerates, the risks of poorly coordinated infrastructure grow. For the US, this wasn’t just someone else’s crisis: it was a glimpse into what could happen without more agile, flexible and resilient grid solutions. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the liabilities inherent in modern power grids, especially as nations accelerate the integration of various energy sources and energy demand skyrockets. This was a clear signal: waiting until the lights go out isn’t a plan.

While growing energy demand affects both the US and European power grids, their underlying structures highlight important differences. In the European Union, grids like those in Spain and Portugal are centrally managed by national operators and aligned under EU-wide standards. This coordination helps with planning but can also create shared vulnerabilities, as seen in the Iberian blackout.

The stark contrast between Europe’s centralised grid and America’s patchwork of regional systems isn’t just a policy quirk—it’s the difference between a blackout that cascades across nations and one that’s isolated to a single state.

The US, by contrast, runs a patchwork of three major interconnections - Eastern, Western and Texas (ERCOT) - each with distinct rules and authorities. While this fragmentation can prevent one region’s failure from toppling another, it also makes coordination harder.

The stark contrast between Europe’s centralised grid and America’s patchwork of regional systems isn’t just a policy quirk: it’s the difference between a blackout that cascades across nations and one that’s isolated to a single state. Spain’s recent grid failure showed how rapidly disruption can spread when systems lack flexibility and rapid-response tools.

In the US, we face a different risk: fragmentation that slows coordination and modernization. Here we’ll explore what the Iberian blackout revealed about grid resilience and make the case for why the US must double down on technologies and planning strategies that respond faster, recover smarter and prevent small disruptions from becoming national crises.

Foundation for resilience

Spain’s blackout revealed how quickly a highly centralised grid can spiral out of control. When one part fails, the rest often follows. In contrast, the US grid, divided into those three interconnections, limits that kind of cascading failure. But it brings its own challenges.

Regionalisation gives US regions autonomy and room to innovate, yet it also leads to fragmented oversight, inconsistent investment and slower modernisation. No single authority manages national planning, which makes coordinating upgrades and integrating renewables harder. Texas, in particular, with its famously independent grid, remains largely cut off from other states. As Winter Storm Uri proved in 2021, this isolation can be devastating when local generation falters.

Ultimately, neither model offers a perfect blueprint. Europe’s centralised approach enables more seamless renewable integration and cross-border coordination but amplifies the risk of widespread disruption. The US, while insulated from cascading failures, faces persistent challenges due to its distributed planning and regulatory landscape.

Strengthening grid resilience will require a hybrid approach—one that enhances coordination and planning across regions without undermining the flexibility and innovation that decentralised systems can provide.

Harnessing technology

The Iberian and Winter Storm Uri blackouts serve as cautionary tales, highlighting the need for proactive measures to enhance grid resilience. In the US, addressing similar vulnerabilities requires a multifaceted approach that leverages advanced technologies to manage increasing energy demands and the integration of renewable sources.

Distributed energy storage systems emerge as a critical solution in this strategy. By providing rapid-response capabilities, these systems can effectively balance supply and demand fluctuations, mitigating the risk of widespread outages. These systems are particularly adept at addressing the intermittency of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which can cause sudden drops in power generation.

Deployed at the front-of-the-meter, these systems also deliver fast frequency response, responding within milliseconds to seconds to arrest frequency deviations during potential disturbances. Put simply, storage brings persistency to intermittent power sources.

Complementing storage, AI offers transformative potential in grid operations. AI-driven predictive dispatch strategies enable more accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply, facilitating real-time adjustments to maintain grid stability. For instance, AI algorithms can analyse vast datasets, including weather patterns and consumption trends, to optimise minute-to-minute energy distribution and preemptively address potential disruptions.

This proactive approach enhances the grid’s adaptability to dynamic conditions, reducing the likelihood of failures akin to the Iberian blackout. These tools are already being piloted in US markets, helping grid operators monitor real-time supply and demand balances and isolate faults faster than human teams ever could on their own.

These systems aren’t just about energy arbitrage; they promise to deliver the sustained support that renewables alone can’t provide during prolonged lulls or cascading failures.

Yet, even as AI and fast-response systems tighten grid operations by the minute, significant gaps remain in bridging extended periods of low renewable output. A key part of the solution lies not just in technology deployment, but in accelerating deployment pathways.

Project delays driven by congested interconnection queues mean storage and energy projects sit idle for years, wasting both time and grid resilience benefits. Yet real momentum is emerging. Recently, Google and PJM announced that they are deploying AI-enhanced planning tools to streamline PJM’s interconnection process and cut completion times for new service requests.

AI scaling already helped PJM process 140GW of applications and aims to shrink interconnection timelines from over 40 months down to just 1–2 years by 2026. That matters because every month shaved off the queue means faster dispatch of batteries and renewables, improved outage prevention and real-world resilience instead of theory.

By pairing rapid-acting storage and smart dispatch with faster interconnection pathways, operators can ensure resilience is not only possible but deployable when and where it’s needed.

Long duration storage

Spain’s blackout exposed a critical gap: even fast-response storage and renewable generation can’t maintain grid stability over prolonged disruption. Long-duration energy Storage (LDES) systems, capable of 10+ hour discharge, could potentially address that gap. These systems aren’t just about energy arbitrage; they promise to deliver the sustained support that renewables alone can’t provide during prolonged lulls or cascading failures. These are often touted as a linchpin for deep renewable integration. But the realities of the landscape require adjustments to policies and timelines.

While LDES technologies are demonstrably viable, market and economic signals lag behind. First, most US wholesale and capacity markets only reward storage that lasts a few hours, not days. This leaves LDES undercompensated for the developers who would otherwise build them, despite the technology’s ability to bridge prolonged renewable gaps.

Second, the lack of steady, duration-based revenue means that LDES often sits idle unless governments incentivise it or markets are reformed. Third, CapEx is high and financing is complex. These systems often require specific siting or geological conditions and are significantly costlier compared to the more common short-duration battery storage assets in operation today.

Instead, traditional energy storage systems are stepping up, delivering real, high-impact resilience across US grids right now. These systems are scaling fast: utility-scale battery storage saw a record 10.3 GW added in 2024 and is on track for an even bigger leap of 18.2 GW in 2025 and is projected to reach up to a total of 65 GW by the end of 2026. This surge signals a new era of fast-acting resilience and trust that storage systems can deploy quickly, shore up grid stability under pressure and unlock tangible value across energy markets.

But batteries can only go so far. When disruptions stretch longer or inertia is needed to arrest frequency swings, hydropower can step in.

Hydropower for resilience

Hydropower’s enduring reliability is why it remains a vital complement to storage-based resilience tools. For decades, hydropower has quietly anchored power grids, offering reliable, stable generation and fast-response flexibility crucial for preventing blackouts. Its spinning generators supply mechanical inertia that helps maintain grid frequency during disturbances and can ramp output in seconds to minutes, much like distributed energy storage systems, making it a powerful tool for restoring balance when other sources are unable.

Recent analysis underscores why this matters: during the Iberian blackout, hydropower plants’ self-start capability and rapid output ramping enabled system operators to restore power to the grid, a real-world demonstration of hydropower’s crisis resilience.

In the US, hydropower projects remain vital resilience tools. Reservoir-based operators can sustain full output for hours or even weeks, aiding long-duration grid balancing during low-renewable periods. As the grid weathers more heatwaves, storms and variable renewable patterns, hydropower’s controllable output and long operational life make it a natural complement to solar and battery energy storage, offering reliability and stability. Growing international investment in modernising hydropower through AI incorporation, retrofits and small modular systems further highlights its evolving role in next-generation grid architecture.

Charting a resilient energy future

The Iberian blackout serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in modern power grids. For the United States, this event underscores the urgency of reimagining grid infrastructure to enhance resilience, flexibility and real-time adaptability.

This transformation requires a diversified approach that builds on proven technologies like battery energy storage systems and taps into underutilised assets like hydropower to provide dependable, dispatchable support. As more renewable energy comes online, grid operators and developers will need to look beyond capacity alone, prioritising systems that can react, recover and stabilize under pressure.

By learning from global grid failures and embracing a layered mix of technologies, the US can build a future-ready grid that’s not just about storing electrons but about supplying uninterrupted, system-wide stability whenever and wherever it is needed.

Wabash Valley Resources intends to pipe and inject 1.67 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface as part of its plan to produce “low-carbon-intensity” anhydrous ammonia fertilizer at a former coal gasification plant.

The gasifier will use coal and petroleum coke — an oil refining byproduct — as feedstock, according to a project summary.

The DOE’s loan was for $1.559 billion.

A panoply of political and business leaders celebrated the announcement, including Indiana Gov. Mike Braun.

“Wabash Valley Resources is putting America first — transforming an idle fossil energy plant into a fertilizer engine that strengthens our farmers, bolsters energy independence, and revitalizes coal country,” he said. “This is the kind of vision and leadership we need to compete globally.”

The company’s CEO, Dan Williams, called the project “more than an investment.”

“It’s a new chapter for a world-class facility and the community that built it,” he said. The project is “restoring good-paying jobs and proving that rural Indiana can help lead America’s clean energy future.”

Williams also praised organized labor, “whose skill and professionalism will bring this vision to life.”

But groups of Hoosier landowners and other opponents denounced the project as a “scam.”

“It is shameful that this administration would hand out $1.5 billion to a privately owned, Korean-backed corporation during a shutdown when everyday people can’t receive basic government services and government employees go unpaid. That is not the American way,” Janet Cianteo, a member of the Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources and Indiana Action Team.

Korean firms Hanwha Asset Management and Korea Investment Real Asset Management have invested in Wabash Valley Resources, and the Korean government has also been involved, according to the company’s news release.

“This company and its foreign partners will be hard pressed to ever have majority support in our community,” Cianteo said. “We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting Hoosier land and lives from this dangerous scheme.”

The Indiana Action Team is part of the Nebraska-based Bold Alliance, best known for its opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline extension.

“It is disgraceful that this project is being foisted on Hoosiers with the backing of our government and our public money,” said Emma Schmit, the Bold Alliance’s pipeline fighters director. “Enough is enough. We should not have to sacrifice our property rights or take on the risks of a proven-to-fail technology so Wabash Valley Resources’ investors can afford another private island.”

Ohioans and Environmental Organizations File Lawsuit Challenging Constitutionality of Air Pollution Amendment in State Budget

Columbus, OH — On Thursday, October 30th, the Ohio Environmental Council, Sierra Club, SOBE Concerned Citizens, Donna Ballinger, and the Freshwater Accountability Project filed a lawsuit against the State of Ohio and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Their complaint alleges that select sections of H.B. 96, Ohio’s state budget passed this summer, violate the One-Subject Rule of the Ohio Constitution.

The Ohio General Assembly snuck anti-environment provisions into H.B. 96 at the last minute that removed important protections for Ohioans who want to file complaints against polluters while taking away Ohioans’ ability to protect themselves using community air monitoring data. These statutory changes have no relationship to Ohio’s budget and thus violate the Ohio Constitution’s requirement that all legislation include only one subject.

Key Facts about the Unconstitutional Provisions

H.B. 96 created R.C. 3704.0310, which requires the Ohio EPA to repeal the Air Nuisance Rule provisions of its Clean Air Act State Implementation Plan.

The Air Nuisance Rule has historically provided an enforcement mechanism for Ohioans to hold polluters accountable for their nuisance pollution impacting fenceline communities.

H.B. 96 also amended R.C. 3704.01, among other provisions, prohibiting the Ohio EPA from relying on “community air monitoring,” data collected by community members using community air monitors installed throughout their community to protect them from air pollution.

Together, these provisions form the Air Pollution Amendment to H.B. 96, which does not include any appropriations or language relevant to Ohio’s state budget.

Counsel from the Case Western Reserve University Environmental Law Clinic, AltmanNewman, Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services, and the Ohio Environmental Council represent the parties.

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Neil Waggoner, Midwest Beyond Coal Campaign Manager for the Sierra Club:

“Ohio’s Air Nuisance Rule has been a critical tool for the public to hold polluters accountable for decades. There has been strong opposition to efforts to roll this rule back for years, which might be part of the reason why the legislature snuck it into the budget bill and conducted no public debate on their scheme. The legislature’s action was not just a violation of the single subject rule; it’s a violation of the public trust and seeks to further violate our rights to take action to protect our communities from polluters.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services:

“At Fair Shake, we believe that everyone should have the right to make decisions about the air, water, and land where they live. This unconstitutional attack attempts to strip Ohioans of their ability to hold polluters accountable through public monitoring and the courts. That is why we are proud to join this lawsuit alongside the Case Western Environmental Law Clinic, the Ohio Environmental Council, and Altman Newman.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Leatra Harper on behalf of Freshwater Accountability:

“At the behest of industry, the Ohio legislature took away the Air Nuisance Rule that has been available for over fifty years to residents seeking protection from harmful air pollution. The people need this rule, and its removal harms the ability of everyday Ohioans to protect themselves from toxic air pollution. This is another example of some legislators in Ohio caring more about protecting polluters than protecting Ohioans.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Lynn Anderson on behalf of SOBE Concerned Citizens:

“The Ohio legislature needs to provide stronger protections for the citizens of Ohio against toxic air pollution in the form of stricter regulation, monitoring, and remediation. By taking away the Air Nuisance Rule and community monitoring provisions, however, they are weakening our existing protections and leaving Ohio communities harmed by toxic air pollution behind.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Dave Altman of AltmanNewman Co. LPA:

“If this illegal action by the State is not corrected, you will still be free to defend your property with firearms, but not with air monitors.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Chris Tavenor, General Counsel for the Ohio Environmental Council (OEC):

“The Ohio General Assembly has once again violated the Ohio Constitution by slipping substantive provisions into its budget bill that have nothing to do with the state budget. This action, on its own, needs to be called out as unconstitutional. But the impact it has on Ohioans seeking to protect their communities from air pollution is just as harmful. The General Assembly should be applauding Ohioans who gather data about air pollution and use it to hold polluters accountable, rather than punishing them.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Miranda Leppla, Director of Case Western Reserve University Environmental Law Clinic:

“Everyday Ohioans merely trying to protect themselves and their loved ones from dangerous air pollution have been robbed of the ability to do so through a violation of a basic tenant of Ohio’s Constitution—that Ohioans should be able to advocate for or against legislation that they care about. These Plaintiffs aim to restore Ohioans’ ability to remedy air pollution impacting their families and to remind the Ohio Legislature that they serve the people, not polluters.”

As world leaders prepare to convene at next month’s COP30 climate summit, the solar power industry has surged far beyond expectations, offering a rare note of progress amid persistent political rifts and uneven commitments to carbon reduction.

According to multiple analyses, there is now four times more installed solar capacity worldwide than experts in 2010 had projected for 2035. This unprecedented expansion has helped temper earlier fears of runaway global warming: temperature rise predictions once as high as 4°C by century’s end have now been revised down to around 2.6°C, driven in large part by renewable energy adoption and declining reliance on fossil fuels.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) describes this transformation as “the fastest energy technology deployment in history.” Once seen as an expensive alternative, solar is now the cheapest form of electricity in most parts of the world, spurring investment, reshaping power markets, and altering the geopolitical balance of energy dependence.

Yet even as the global picture brightens, momentum remains uneven. Nowhere is this contrast clearer than in the United States, where President Donald Trump’s administration has dismantled clean energy incentives, slashed subsidies, and tightened permitting rules, stalling the very progress that once positioned America at the forefront of the renewable revolution.

While US states such as California and Texas continue to see strong private-sector investment, national policy has turned sharply inward. Trump’s rollback of federal clean energy tax credits, combined with his administration’s expansion of oil and gas drilling, has left the country lagging behind China, the European Union, and India in new solar installations.

A backdrop of progress ahead of COP30

Next month, delegates will gather for the COP30 climate conference amid both hope and uncertainty. The boom in renewable energy particularly solar, provides a strong counterpoint to fears of climate inaction. Yet, even as countries like China, Britain and Australia announce ambitious climate targets, the European Union remains divided on its 2040 emission goals.

According to EU documents seen by Reuters, bloc members have failed to reach consensus on cutting emissions by 90% by 2040, with final negotiations expected just days before the summit. “We are walking a knife’s edge,” one EU diplomat said, warning that failure could weaken the EU’s climate leadership at COP30.

Europe’s divisions cloud its leadership claim

The EU’s inability to finalise its climate target highlights the growing tension between ambition and economic reality. Wealthier members such as Sweden and Spain back aggressive emission cuts, while others, notably Poland and Italy have voiced concerns that rapid decarbonisation could harm domestic industries.

A particularly divisive issue is the use of foreign carbon credits. France has proposed that countries be allowed to offset up to 5% of emissions using credits from developing nations, while Germany supports a stricter 3% cap. Poland has pushed for an even higher threshold, citing industrial competitiveness. A French proposal to include an “emergency brake”, allowing countries to ease their targets if forest carbon absorption underperforms has also divided opinion.

Global solar power gains but uneven momentum

Even as Europe wrestles with internal disagreements, solar power’s rise has tempered global pessimism on climate goals. According to WebProNews, solar capacity worldwide is expanding at a pace far beyond earlier expectations driven by lower costs, mass manufacturing in Asia, and breakthroughs in storage technologies.

However, this progress is uneven across regions. China leads the charge, accounting for more than half of global solar additions, followed by rapid growth in India, the EU, and parts of Latin America. By contrast, the United States has seen momentum stall sharply amid policy reversals under the Trump administration.

Trump’s rollback slows US transition

US support for solar has collapsed following President Donald Trump’s decision to scrap subsidies and roll back renewable energy incentives. New permitting rules have further complicated project approvals, creating uncertainty for investors. Analysts warn that this policy reversal could make the US one of the few major economies to fall short of its renewable capacity targets by 2030.

While states like California and New York continue to push aggressive clean energy mandates, the lack of federal coordination has left America lagging behind global peers. Industry experts say this slowdown threatens not just climate commitments but also energy security, as the world moves towards decentralised, renewable-driven grids.

Outlook: optimism, tempered by politics

The solar boom demonstrates what coordinated investment and innovation can achieve in a relatively short span. But political divisions, both within the EU and the US threaten to blunt the full potential of this transformation.

As COP30 approaches, the world faces a paradox: technological progress has outstripped expectations, yet political will remains fragmented. Whether the coming decade delivers on the promise of a renewable revolution may depend less on engineering breakthroughs and more on governments finding consensus to sustain the momentum already underway.

(AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn't buy an EV. That's significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That's a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans' anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that's long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut's state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He's taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

Fifty members of Congress, led by Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-IA), sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin Thursday to express strong support for the reallocation of 100% of the waived gallons from any granted SREs, and to urge the EPA to finalize the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) “Set 2” rule as quickly as possible.

“President Trump and his administration have done great work to lower prices at the pump for American families. A final, timely Set 2 rule that includes strong RVOs and necessary reallocation represents the most meaningful commitment to farmers and rural communities, homegrown American energy, and affordability for consumers,” said Rep. Feenstra.

The Renewable Fuels Association submitted comments today strongly urged EPA to reallocate 100 percent of exempted renewable fuel volumes, given the agency’s statutory obligation to ensure that finalized blending requirements are met. Additionally, RFA reiterated its position that EPA must prospectively reallocate exempted volumes anticipated for 2026 and 2027.

RFA expressed serious concern with the agency’s continued reliance on an outdated and flawed Department of Energy study to evaluate petitions for small refinery exemption, and emphasized that EPA should modernize its evaluation process for exemption petitions by using current market data, transparent metrics, and rigorous economic analysis when determining claims of “disproportionate economic hardship.” According to the association, doing so would help ensure a more level playing field across the refining sector and protect the integrity of the RFS program.

In its comments to EPA Friday, Clean Fuels Alliance America also urged the agency to adopt supplemental “SRE reallocation volumes” and updated estimates of exempted volumes for 2026 and 2027 representing 100% of all granted, pending, and expected exemptions for the 2023 – 2025 compliance years. Clean Fuels also asked the agency to be judicious in granting exemptions.

Published 7:20 am Friday, October 31, 2025

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

It’s impossible to ignore the headlines announcing another major company relocating to Texas or the census data showing a historic influx of new residents. This isn’t a fleeting trend; it’s a foundational economic shift drawing the nation’s center of gravity toward the Lone Star State. What are the underlying conditions causing this remarkable growth?

Think of it as diagnosing a thriving patient. You can see the outward signs of health, but to understand the prognosis, you must examine the vital systems working in concert. We need to look past the surface to see the anatomy of this business powerhouse.

What is Fueling This Unprecedented Growth Spurt?

Texas’s appeal stems from the “Texas Model,” a strategy built on low taxes, no state income tax, and simple regulations. This approach minimizes business friction, enabling reinvestment and innovation across sectors like energy, technology, manufacturing, and life sciences—attracting major companies such as Oracle and Tesla.

Why is the Texas Economy More Resilient Than People Think?

Today, technology, professional services, manufacturing, and healthcare contribute enormously to the state’s GDP, creating a well-diversified economic base. This strength is reinforced by targeted workforce initiatives. According to a study by UpperCutSEO, an Austin SEO company, one such program offers up to $1,800 per trainee to assist Texas public community and technical colleges to finance customized job training for local businesses.

Texas’s diversified economy acts like a balanced diet when one sector slows, others sustain growth, ensuring long-term economic stability and investor confidence.

How Does the State’s Infrastructure Support This Expansion?

A healthy body needs a strong skeleton and circulatory system to support its growth. Similarly, Texas’s economic vitality depends on its robust physical and human infrastructure. Here are the core components that enable this rapid expansion:

The Role of Logistics and Transportation

Texas’s central location gives businesses a powerful logistical edge. With highways, railways, airports, and major ports like Houston, companies can manage supply chains efficiently, cutting costs and shortening delivery times nationwide.

The Energy Sector’s Modern Evolution

Texas is not just an oil and gas titan; it’s also the nation’s leader in wind power generation. This dual-strength energy profile provides businesses with reliable, abundant, and increasingly sustainable power options. This versatility ensures operational stability and helps companies meet modern environmental standards.

Where are the Primary Hubs of Innovation Emerging?

Texas’s growth centers on the “Texas Triangle”: Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio, each with unique strengths. DFW thrives in finance, Houston in energy and medicine, and Austin, known as “Silicon Hills,” drives global tech and venture capital expansion through its hyper-competitive digital market.

What Practical Steps Should Businesses Consider Before Relocating?

Expanding into Texas demands precision and planning. Each region offers distinct advantages, so assess which city’s talent, supply chain, and customer base align with your goals. While costs are lower, competition for specialized talent is fierce. Understanding wage trends and offering competitive packages ensures sustainable success.

Plan for a Pro-Growth Regulatory Environment

Take the time to understand local zoning laws, permitting processes, and tax incentive programs to ensure a smooth launch and capitalize on the opportunities available from day one. One such opportunity is the Texas Small Business Credit Initiative (TSBCI), which allocates $472 million to strengthen the state’s small business ecosystem. The State of Texas is actively monitoring updates from the U.S. Department of the Treasury to ensure optimal implementation of this initiative.

What Does the Future Hold for the Lone Star State?

Texas’s outlook remains strong, with major investments in future industries like aerospace, biotech, and life sciences shaping lasting growth. Yet challenges persist—power grid strain, congestion, and housing costs. How effectively Texas manages these pressures will define its next stage of sustainable development.

Frequently Asked Questions

Is the Texas economy still too dependent on oil prices?

No. While the energy sector remains important, technology, manufacturing, and professional services are now massive contributors to the state’s GDP. This diversification makes it far more stable and resilient to fluctuations in oil prices than in the past.

What is the biggest challenge for businesses moving to Texas?

The primary challenge is often the intense competition for talent in high-growth metro areas like Austin and Dallas. While the overall workforce is large, securing specialized skills requires a strong recruitment strategy and competitive compensation packages.

Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.","KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn't buy an EV. That's significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That's a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans' anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that's long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut's state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He's taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

In comments to EPA on Friday, Clean Fuels Alliance America also called on the agency to reallocate 100% of SRE gallons.
Accounting for 100% of the exemptions granted and expected is the only way to ensure that robust 2026 and 2027 RFS volumes will be met.""
The National Oilseed Processors Association called on the EPA to finalize the 2026-2027 volumes proposal.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- Forty-nine members of Congress asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to reallocate 100% of biofuels gallons exempted from 2023-2025 to small-refinery exemptions from the Renewable Fuel Standard, as the public comment period on the agency's proposal ends on Friday.

In September the Trump administration launched the public comment period on a proposal to reallocate SRE gallons at a rate from zero, to 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%.

Biofuels groups in the past month have expressed support for reallocating all those gallons, estimated at around 2 billion gallons.

In a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, a group of 49 representatives and senators put their weight behind 100% reallocation and finalize the rule as ""quickly"" as possible.

""At a time when farm families and rural communities face tough markets and economic uncertainty, we appreciate EPA's recognition of the vital role American biofuels and agriculture play in lowering fuel prices and

advancing American energy dominance,"" the letter said.

""The proposed volumes in the Set 2 rule represent a meaningful commitment to supporting cheaper homegrown fuels, farm income and rural economies. These volumes matter not just to biofuel producers, but to the farmers who grow the corn, soybeans and other feedstocks that power this economy and to every American who enjoys lower prices at the pump because of biofuels. A strong RVO means stronger commodity prices, more stable markets and greater opportunity for rural America.""

The letter signed by 49 federal lawmakers was led by Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, who was joined by Reps. Nikki Budzinski, D-Ill.; Brad Finstad, R-Minn., and Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Mich.; along with and Sens. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; and Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.

""As EPA considers its supplemental proposal, we urge the agency to fully reallocate 100% of the waived gallons for compliance years 2023-2025,"" the lawmakers said.

""Without full restoration the benefits of the original proposal won't reach the farm gate or lower prices at the pump. Farmers and rural businesses will ultimately bear the brunt of weakened demand and lower prices. Congress created the RFS to boost biofuel use for the benefit of American families, the economy and our energy security. It is critical that the EPA follow the directive outlined in the RFS to issue timely and reflective RVOs. Every day the rule remains unfinished means uncertainty for producers and missed opportunities for rural communities.""

In comments to EPA on Friday, Clean Fuels Alliance America also called on the agency to reallocate 100% of SRE gallons.

""Clean Fuels appreciates EPA's acknowledgement that small-refinery exemptions will destroy demand for biomass-based diesel over the next several years by enabling refiners to avoid RFS obligations,"" Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels' vice president of federal affairs, said in a statement.

""Small-refinery exemptions should not come at the expense of clean fuel producers and farmers. Accounting for 100% of the exemptions granted and expected is the only way to ensure that robust 2026 and 2027 RFS volumes will be met.""

The Renewable Fuels Association also called for complete reallocation and expressed concern about the data used by EPA when considering SRE petitions.

""RFA appreciates EPA's recognition that a strong RFS is crucially important to rural America and we applaud the decision to return expired RINs to exempted refiners for RFS compliance years that are already closed,"" RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper said in a statement.

""However, it is critically important that EPA reallocate 100% of exempted volumes for compliance years that are still open and for future years and we remain deeply concerned about EPA's reliance on a 14-year-old department of energy study that no longer reflects the realities of today's energy and fuels markets. If EPA returns 'live' RINs to small refiners for their 2023-2025 exemptions and then fails to reallocate those volumes, the effects on RIN values and biofuel marketplace could be catastrophic.""

The National Oilseed Processors Association called on the EPA to finalize the 2026-2027 volumes proposal.

The group said in a news release that in a ""break from tradition"" NOPA submitted a single-page comment, a ""deliberate choice to emphasize that the time for further deliberation has passed and that swift action is urgently needed"" to provide market certainty for America's farmers, oilseed processors and renewable fuel producers.

""Our message to EPA is simple: finalize the rule now,"" said Devin Mogler, president and CEO of NOPA.

""Every day of delay adds more uncertainty for farmers and processors -- the EPA has already done an excellent job with a proposal that includes BBD volumes reflective of the industry's capacity and a half-RIN provision that prioritizes domestic feedstocks.""

Climate First President: 'These Notes provide the capital and flexibility to continue to invest in America's renewable energy independence'

Climate First Bancorp, the holding company for Climate First Bank and OneEthos, today announced it had completed a $30 million private placement offering of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes. Climate First Bancorp will use the net proceeds from the offering to continue the company's rapid national growth, especially in its residential solar financing business.

Piper Sandler & Co. served as sole placement agent for the Notes, which bear a fixed-rate interest of eight percent for the first five years and mature on November 1, 2035. Jack Greeley of Smith Mackinnon PA served as legal counsel to Climate First Bancorp and Alston & Bird, LLP served as placement agent's counsel to Piper Sandler & Co. EJF Capital, a global institutional alternative asset management firm, is a lead investor.

The new Notes come as Climate First Bank, the world's first FDIC-insured, values-based, digital-forward community bank founded to combat the climate crisis, announced that it had financed more than $60 million in residential solar deals in October alone - powered by its fintech arm OneEthos. October's total marked the bank's largest solar financing month ever, nearly double the amount financed in September.

The strong demand comes as the latest tax and spend package by Congress sunset residential solar tax credits at the end of the year.

'The strong demand for these Notes makes it clear that investments into America's renewable energy infrastructure - from residential and commercial solar and wind farms to battery energy storage - are only just beginning,' said Ken LaRoe, CEO of Climate First Bancorp. 'By fighting climate change, we aren't just on the right side of climate history moving forward, we are on the right side of the consumer and capital markets today.'

'With the Federal solar tax credits coming to an end, homeowners and installers across the country are racing to finalize deals. These Notes will not only help us support their work, but provide us with the capital and flexibility to invest in America's renewable energy independence,' said Lex Ford, President of Climate First Bancorp.

'Together, Climate First Bank and OneEthos offer the best, easiest-to-use solar platform on the market today - both for installers and homeowners,' said Marcio deOliveira, CEO of OneEthos. 'While other providers have stepped away from the industry, we are doubling down, investing in the people and technology that will make us a market leader for the next generation. That's critical in our fight against climate change.'

Additional Background on Climate First Bancorp's $30 Million Subordinated Notes

The Notes will initially bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 8.00% for the first five years, payable semi-annually in arrears, to be excluding November 1, 2030, at which time the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual floating rate equal to the then current three-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 472 basis points, with interest during this period payable quarterly in arrears.

Climate First Bancorp may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after November 1, 2030, or at any time, in whole but not in part, upon other specified events.

The Notes have been structured to qualify for Tier 2 capital for Climate First Bancorp for regulatory capital purposes.

Climate First Bancorp, the holding company for Climate First Bank and OneEthos, today announced it had completed a $30 million private placement offering of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes. Climate First Bancorp will use the net proceeds from the offering to continue the company's rapid national growth, especially in its residential solar financing business.

Piper Sandler & Co. served as sole placement agent for the Notes, which bear a fixed-rate interest of eight percent for the first five years and mature on November 1, 2035. Jack Greeley of Smith Mackinnon PA served as legal counsel to Climate First Bancorp and Alston & Bird, LLP served as placement agent's counsel to Piper Sandler & Co. EJF Capital, a global institutional alternative asset management firm, is a lead investor.

The new Notes come as Climate First Bank, the world's first FDIC-insured, values-based, digital-forward community bank founded to combat the climate crisis, announced that it had financed more than $60 million in residential solar deals in October alone - powered by its fintech arm OneEthos. October's total marked the bank's largest solar financing month ever, nearly double the amount financed in September.

The strong demand comes as the latest tax and spend package by Congress sunset residential solar tax credits at the end of the year.

'The strong demand for these Notes makes it clear that investments into America's renewable energy infrastructure - from residential and commercial solar and wind farms to battery energy storage - are only just beginning,' said Ken LaRoe, CEO of Climate First Bancorp. 'By fighting climate change, we aren't just on the right side of climate history moving forward, we are on the right side of the consumer and capital markets today.'

'With the Federal solar tax credits coming to an end, homeowners and installers across the country are racing to finalize deals. These Notes will not only help us support their work, but provide us with the capital and flexibility to invest in America's renewable energy independence,' said Lex Ford, President of Climate First Bancorp.

'Together, Climate First Bank and OneEthos offer the best, easiest-to-use solar platform on the market today - both for installers and homeowners,' said Marcio deOliveira, CEO of OneEthos. 'While other providers have stepped away from the industry, we are doubling down, investing in the people and technology that will make us a market leader for the next generation. That's critical in our fight against climate change.'

Additional Background on Climate First Bancorp's $30 Million Subordinated Notes

The Notes will initially bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 8.00% for the first five years, payable semi-annually in arrears, to be excluding November 1, 2030, at which time the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual floating rate equal to the then current three-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 472 basis points, with interest during this period payable quarterly in arrears.

Climate First Bancorp may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after November 1, 2030, or at any time, in whole but not in part, upon other specified events.

The Notes have been structured to qualify for Tier 2 capital for Climate First Bancorp for regulatory capital purposes.

For the 2023-2025 compliance years, however, the association strongly urged EPA to reallocate 100 percent of exempted renewable fuel volumes, given the agency’s statutory obligation to ensure that finalized blending requirements are met.
Additionally, RFA reiterated its position that EPA must prospectively reallocate exempted volumes anticipated for 2026 and 2027.

If EPA returns ‘live’ RINs to small refiners for their 2023-2025 exemptions and then fails to reallocate those volumes, the effects on RIN values and the biofuel marketplace could be catastrophic.","The Renewable Fuels Association today submitted comments to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in response to its supplemental proposal addressing reallocation of biofuel blending volumes lost to small refinery exemptions under the Renewable Fuel Standard.

RFA praised EPA for taking steps to protect market integrity by returning expired renewable identification numbers (RINs) to refiners that were granted exemptions for 2016-2022, years for which compliance is now closed. For the 2023-2025 compliance years, however, the association strongly urged EPA to reallocate 100 percent of exempted renewable fuel volumes, given the agency’s statutory obligation to ensure that finalized blending requirements are met. Additionally, RFA reiterated its position that EPA must prospectively reallocate exempted volumes anticipated for 2026 and 2027.

At the same time, RFA expressed serious concern with the agency’s continued reliance on an outdated and flawed Department of Energy study to evaluate petitions for small refinery exemption, and the association urged EPA to take a more modern, transparent, and data-driven approach going forward.

“RFA appreciates EPA’s recognition that a strong RFS is crucially important to rural America, and we applaud the decision to return expired RINs to exempted refiners for RFS compliance years that are already closed,” said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper. “However, it is critically important that EPA reallocate 100% of exempted volumes for compliance years that are still open and for future years, and we remain deeply concerned about EPA’s reliance on a 14-year-old Department of Energy study that no longer reflects the realities of today’s energy and fuels markets. If EPA returns ‘live’ RINs to small refiners for their 2023-2025 exemptions and then fails to reallocate those volumes, the effects on RIN values and the biofuel marketplace could be catastrophic. Some refiners have shown over and over again that they will comply with the RFS by turning in cheap RINs rather than blending physical volumes of renewable fuel.”

RFA emphasized that EPA should modernize its evaluation process for exemption petitions by using current market data, transparent metrics, and rigorous economic analysis when determining claims of “disproportionate economic hardship.” According to the association, doing so would help ensure a more level playing field across the refining sector and protect the integrity of the RFS program.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/796/1000/EPA-Offices.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 11:27:43.970681

“This HoA represents another key step in building the mine-to-oxide pathway between allied nations,” stated Pat Ryan, P.Eng., Ucore’s Chairman and CEO. “By partnering with Wyloo and Hastings, we are securing potential feedstock for our Louisiana SMC and exploring U.S. Hydromet options that add flexibility and scale to our DoD-backed RapidSX™ separation program.“

Chief Executive Officer, Mr Vince Catania said: “We are delighted to partner with Ucore on this strategically significant HoA. This agreement represents a major step forward in de-risking the Yangibana Project by securing a pathway to a long-term offtake partner in the key North American market. More importantly, the joint evaluation of a downstream Hyrdromet plant in the US demonstrates the efforts by Wyloo, Ucore and Hastings to access the financing and commercial opportunities arising from the recently announced rare earth deal by the US and Australian governments to jointly support “ready to go” projects.“

Geoff Atkins, VP Business Development at Ucore, added: “Yangibana is one of the world’s most advanced, shovel-ready rare earth projects, with amongst the highest distributions of NdPr of any known deposit. This agreement is an important step in Ucore securing a fully aligned mine-to-oxide supply chain across trusted jurisdictions.”

Expanded Details on the HoA

Under the HoA, Wyloo and Hastings (through their 60:40 Yangibana Joint Venture) and Ucore will work collaboratively to advance a potential long-term offtake and Hydromet partnership.

Feedstock Framework: The HoA contemplates up to 37,000 tonnes per annum of Yangibana rare earth concentrate, sourced from the Stage 1 mine and beneficiation circuit of the Yangibana Project. Pricing is to be based on a per-DMT formula or fixed structure to be defined in the definitive offtake agreement.

U.S. Hydromet Evaluation: The parties will jointly complete a Gap Analysis and techno-economic assessment of a new Hydromet facility in Louisiana, or a qualified third-party U.S. facility, to convert concentrate into mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) suitable for downstream separation at Ucore’s SMC.

Strategic Alignment: The project supports the United States-Australia Framework for Securing of Supply in the Mining and Processing of Critical Minerals and Rare Earths (“U.S.-Australia Framework”) announced on October 20, 2025, which aims to build integrated supply chains across allied jurisdictions. The HoA directly responds to this initiative by linking Australian concentrate production with U.S. mid-stream processing and separation.

Timeline and Governance: The HoA is non-binding (except for clauses related to confidentiality and governing law, which is Australian), has a 24-month term, and may be extended by mutual consent.

Strategic Benefits

For Ucore: Anchors an allied feedstock source for Ucore’s DoD-funded Louisiana SMC, supporting commissioning in H2-2026 and establishing one of the first U.S. facilities capable of producing separated rare earth oxides at commercial scale.

For Wyloo and Hastings: Opens a U.S. downstream channel into the magnet materials market through a government-supported separation platform, strengthening financing and offtake options during the Yangibana Project’s ramp-up.

For Allied supply chains: Reinforces U.S.-Australia cooperation on critical minerals and expands ex-China sources of NdPr, Sm, Gd, Dy, and Tb, key to defense, EV, and clean energy manufacturing.

For Policy Makers: Demonstrates practical progress under the U.S.-Australia Framework through a tangible mine-to-oxide collaboration designed to deliver diversified, secure, and transparent rare earth supply chains.

“Oracle is excited for Michigan to be the next site for our Stargate project with OpenAI.
Founded in 1972, privately-owned Related Companies has more than $70 billion in assets owned or under development.
The company launched its data center arm, Related Digital, earlier this year.
""Today, we won the largest economic project in Michigan history,"" said Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.","It will be part of Stargate, OpenAI's sprawling project to invest $500bn in digital infrastructure over the next four years to support the firm's compute needs.

“We are proud to be developing this critical project exclusively for Oracle and contributing to keeping our nation competitive in the global AI race,” said Jeff T. Blau, CEO of Related Companies and chairman of Related Digital. “This historic, multi-billion-dollar investment will ensure that Michigan plays a leading role in developing the digital infrastructure American companies need.”

The 250-acre site – known as The Barn – will consist of three 550,000 sq ft (51,097 sqm) single-story buildings, and reportedly use a closed-loop cooling system to reduce water use.

Pending approval by the Michigan Public Service Commission, construction is set to start in early 2026. Walbridge is to serve as the general contractor on the project.

DTE Energy is supplying 100 percent of the power to the project using existing resources augmented by a new battery storage investment – financed entirely by the project.

Related first pitched plans for a large-scale data center campus in Saline Township back in August. At the time, the company was pitching a 575-acre project totaling 2.2 million sq ft (204,385 sqm) floorspace across five buildings. The company filed a lawsuit against the township after a rezoning request for the project was refused, which was settled earlier this month.

“This project will help ensure Michigan is a key part of building the AI infrastructure that will power the next generation of American innovation,” said Peter Hoeschele, OpenAI’s vice president of industrial compute. “By expanding Stargate to Michigan, we can strengthen domestic supply chains, create good jobs, and help more communities share in the economic opportunities AI is creating. We’re proud to work with Oracle, Related Digital, DTE Energy, and other partners to bring this project to life in a way that benefits the local community.”

The companies noted the project is part of OpenAI and Oracle’s previously announced partnership to deliver 4.5GW of additional Stargate capacity.

“Oracle is excited for Michigan to be the next site for our Stargate project with OpenAI. Historically, Michigan has been at the forefront of innovation and industry in America, and this strong legacy will continue as we work with Related Digital to rapidly expand our cloud capacity to meet the unprecedented demand for AI,” said Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “Oracle’s highly performant, secure, and cost-effective AI infrastructure is powering advanced AI systems to help ensure the US maintains its leadership in technology innovation for generations to come.”

Stargate was launched by OpenAI in January, in partnership with SoftBank, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi's MGX. As well as the now-live project in Abilene, Texas, Stargate campuses are in development across the US in Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and Port Washington, Wisconsin. Internationally, OpenAI has projects in the works across South Korea, Canada, the UK, Germany, Norway, and Argentina – with rumored projects possibly coming to Canada and India.

Founded in 1972, privately-owned Related Companies has more than $70 billion in assets owned or under development. Its investments include mixed-use, residential, retail, office, and hospitality developments. The company launched its data center arm, Related Digital, earlier this year.

As well as a 64MW project in Ontario, Canada, the company said its pipeline includes a 1GW 400-acre campus in Chicago, Illinois; a 500-acre, 1GW campus in Illinois; a 600-acre, 1.2GW site in Missouri; and a 115-acre, 250MW campus in Wyoming.

Saline Township, located outside Saline city, is located some 45 miles (72km) west of downtown Detroit. Despite not being a traditional data center hotspot, demand for data centers has pushed operators into the area. This includes Thor Equities, which has faced pushback from local officials after seeking to develop an 800-acre campus in Washtenaw County’s Augusta Township. Operators around Detroit include EdgeConneX, US Signal, Cogent, 365, Lumen, Verizon, and several local providers.

""Today, we won the largest economic project in Michigan history,"" said Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. “I’m grateful to these cutting-edge companies for betting on Michigan, building on our work to compete for and win big projects in next-generation industries from cars and clean energy to semiconductors and batteries. This investment from Oracle and Related Digital sends a simple message to anyone who wants to build the future—you can build it in Michigan.”",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/Related_Digital.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.png,N,,2025-10-31 12:08:22.731617

Fortunately, Long Island elected officials in both parties have stepped up.
Not to mention, Long Islanders had ample opportunity to weigh in on the energy planning process, a clear understanding that local control is sacred to us on Long Island.
Republican representatives Andrew Garbarino and Nick Lalota have remained steadfast in their support for offshore wind at a time when it could have been politically convenient to abandon ship.
It is a practical bridge that ensures our communities have reliable, lower-carbon energy while offshore wind, community solar and utility scale battery energy storage scale up.","Long Island sits at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean; beautiful, vulnerable and exposed. We are in the heart of storm season, and do not have to dig deep to recall Superstorm Sandy, Tropical Storm Isaias and countless nor’easters that have ripped apart our shorelines, flooded basements and disrupted our lives. And yet, working people remain caught in the crossfire of political gamesmanship. How we power our economy is constantly presented as a choice between a clean environment and a strong economy. The reality is that we can and must have both.

Fortunately, Long Island elected officials in both parties have stepped up. Dan Panico, the Republican Brookhaven town supervisor, and Kathee Burke-Gonzalez the Democratic East Hampton town supervisor have allowed facts and information to guide their respective town’s policy making. They have done the hard work of connecting with residents, and holding education forums with independent experts to alleviate residents’ concerns. Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine, a Republican, has continued to champion green initiatives such as Solar Up Suffolk, as well as offshore wind—both as supervisor and county executive—despite the political headwinds.

New York State recently held a series of public hearings on a draft energy plan put forward by Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, which creates a path forward for an all-of-the-above energy strategy that combats climate change and creates good union jobs. Not to mention, Long Islanders had ample opportunity to weigh in on the energy planning process, a clear understanding that local control is sacred to us on Long Island. Republican representatives Andrew Garbarino and Nick Lalota have remained steadfast in their support for offshore wind at a time when it could have been politically convenient to abandon ship. Their advocacy undoubtedly protected projects that have created millions of work hours with good union wages, for Long Islanders across the region.

Therefore, we must not let bad faith actors reframe the energy discussion as a zero-sum game. We have clear evidence of a bipartisan understanding that Long Island’s energy system must withstand extreme weather, rising seas and arguably the most dangerous threat of our time, political chaos.

The Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) project fits squarely within that vision. It is a practical bridge that ensures our communities have reliable, lower-carbon energy while offshore wind, community solar and utility scale battery energy storage scale up. Natural gas delivered through modern infrastructure significantly reduces carbon emissions when compared with heating oil and coal, which still power too many older buildings and backup generators across Long Island and New York City.

Concurrently, NESE will create good-paying, union construction jobs with healthcare, apprenticeship training and the economic stability that lifts whole communities. These types of investments sustain local economies, support small businesses and allow workers to raise families. They also protect existing union jobs in industries that depend on safe, reliable energy delivery; from the proud members of IBEW Local 1049 who maintain the grid, to manufacturing and food-service employees who rely on stable heating and power to support their industries. Every step toward modernizing our energy network is a step toward securing those livelihoods and a cleaner future.

Critics sometimes suggest that supporting a project like NESE contradicts New York’s climate leadership. That is simply not true. We cannot power hospitals, schools and subways by limiting our generation options. The bridge to a clean-energy future must be built, literally, by working people. On Long Island, that means a need for massive infrastructure investment in transmission lines, offshore wind, utility scale battery energy storage, and yes, modern gas infrastructure that keeps homes warm and lights on while we lean in on proven utility scale renewable energy technologies.

Long Island’s labor movement is ready to lead. Our true north star must be the economic security of working families. Without them, there is no just transition and no sustainable future. We can confront climate change, strengthen our economy, and put people to work, all at once. The Northeast Supply Enhancement Project is not the end of our journey toward a cleaner world; it’s one necessary step on the way.",https://libn.com/files/2025/03/John-Durso2.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 11:27:28.843190

(AP) — If there's agreement on anything in the two states with governor's races this year, it's that utility bills are a growing concern among voters.

One Virginia voter, Kim Wilson, lamented at a town hall recently that her electricity bill seems to go up every month, no matter how much she tries to mitigate the costs. She was drawn to the event in part by its title: “The energy bills are too damn high.”

“It’s way too high,” Wilson readily agreed.

In New Jersey, Herb Michitsch of Kenilworth said his electric bill has climbed to nearly $400 a month, or more than four times what it was when he and his wife moved into their home half a century ago.

“Something really has to be done,” Michitsch said.

That something must be done is pretty much where the agreement ends. It's what must be done that splits politicians back into rival camps.

Democratic candidates in the two states are far more likely to embrace clean energy options like wind and solar than their Republican opponents. The two states’ Republican nominees are more closely aligned with the policies of President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a “con job” and promotes more traditional energy sources like gas and coal. New Jersey Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli has acknowledged that human-caused climate change is occurring, but he says Democrats have driven up costs with their clean energy push.

Which side voters land on in the off-year elections will give both parties plenty to consider in what feels destined to be an emerging economic issue heading into next year's midterm elections.

At a recent rally in New Jersey, Democratic state Sen. Vin Gopal made clear that he stood with Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill in support of her plans to lower costs. But Gopal acknowledged that the outcome could signal whether voters are ready to embrace the president’s approach or have simply grown weary of national politics.

“The whole country is watching what happens,” he said.

Technology drives up costs

The debate comes as people in the two states grapple with double-digit percentage increases in monthly electricity bills. The exploding costs are driven by soaring demand, particularly from data centers, and by the rapid onset of energy-intensive artificial intelligence technology.

In Virginia’s open race to succeed a term-limited GOP incumbent, Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears are at odds over the development of renewable energy sources.

Spanberger has laid out a plan to expand solar and wind production in underused locations, praising a wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach. In a debate against her opponent, she also said she would “ensure that data centers pay their fair share” as costs rise. The state is home to the world’s largest data center market,

Republican Winsome Earle-Sears wasn't having it.

“That’s all she wants, is solar and wind,” Earle-Sears said of Spanberger at the debate. “Well, if you look outside, the sun isn’t shining and the breeze isn’t blowing, and then what, Abigail, what will you do?”

In New Jersey, where Ciattarelli's endorsement by Trump included recent social media posts praising his energy affordability plans, the GOP nominee blames rising costs on eight years of Democratic control of state government.

Ciattarelli says he would pull New Jersey out of a regional greenhouse gas trading bloc, which Democratic incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy reentered when he first took office in 2018.

“It’s been a failure,” Ciattarelli said at the final debate of the campaign. “Electricity is at an all-time high.”

He’s also come out as a strident opponent of wind energy off the state’s coast, an effort Democrats spearheaded under Murphy. A major offshore wind project ground to a halt when the Danish company overseeing it scrapped projects, citing supply chain problems and high interest rates.

At the center of Sherrill’s campaign promise on the issue is an executive order to freeze rates and build cheaper and cleaner power generation.

“I know my opponent laughs at it,” Sherrill said recently.

A growing concern among voters

The candidates’ focus on affordability and utility rates reflects an unease among voters. A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found electricity bills are a ""major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults, at a time when data center development for AI could further strain the power grid.

Perhaps that's why the statewide races have become something of an energy proxy battle in Virginia. Clean Virginia, a clean energy advocacy group that targets utility corruption, has backed all three Democratic candidates for statewide office in Virginia — a first for the organization. GOP statewide candidates, meanwhile, have accepted money from Dominion Energy, the largest electric utility in Virginia.

To further complicate an already complex issue: Virginia has passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which calls for utilities to sunset carbon energy production methods by 2045.

Republican House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, who represents the southwest edge of Virginia, had failed to alter part of the state's Clean Economy Act earlier this year. Kilgore, whose top donor is Dominion Energy, said in February: “If their bills go any higher, there are folks in my region that are not able to pay them now, they’re definitely not going to be able to pay them in the future.”

Evan Vaughn, executive director of MAREC Action, a group of Mid-Atlantic renewable energy developers, said candidates from both parties are in a tough spot because bringing down prices quickly will be difficult given broader market dynamics.

“Voters should look to which candidate they think can do the best to stabilize prices by bringing more generation online,” he said. “That’s really going to be the key to affordability.”

Michitsch, who’s backing Sherrill in the governor's race and said he would campaign for her, said her proposal shows she's willing to do something to address spiraling costs.

“We need to change,” he said. “And I think she is here to change things.”",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/8d24ea2/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F3a%2Fd059c444ac4c48c2e9045196280b7e%2F2d1e242fffbd4d74ab663c4369c7de7dElection_2026_Redistricting_37610.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 11:01:12.621854

PROPOSED WORK and PURPOSE: The applicant requests authorization to perform new (deepening and berth extension) and maintenance (future) dredging of the Metro Machine Corp-Nassco Norfolk-Harper berthing areas (Pier 1 North and South, Pier 2 North and South) and the widener (total dredge area: 1,045,350 SF/24.00 acres) to the maximum depths ranging from -27 ft MLLW (widener) to -38 ft MLLW (Piers 1 & 2). The proposed dredging would remove approximately 213,775 cy (and approximately 100,000 cy every 5 years) and would be either hydraulically dredged and pumped directly to CIDDMA, or mechanically dredged and barged to the Rehandling Basin, Shirley Plantation, and/or Dominion.

AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION: The applicant has provided the following information in support of efforts to avoid and/or minimize impacts to the aquatic environment: The existing berth areas in the vicinity of Pier 1 and Pier 2 are currently permitted to -36 ft MLW, which means that they can only dredge to ~-34.0 ft to avoid overdepth violations. Due to the expansion projects in the federal channel, larger ships are calling at the facility and NASSCO Harper requires a minimum depth of -36 ft and larger berths in order to stay competitive in the ship repair industry. In order to reach a design depth of -36 ft – the permitted depth needs to be two feet deeper to avoid a dredging violation. There is also a small widener associated with the northern most berth at Pier 1. Originally the design included the widener to a depth of -38 ft as well – but since that area will primarily be used as a tug shelf and to allow a little more flexibility in maneuvering ships into the slip, the depth was reduced to -27 ft. When practicable, turbidity curtains and an environmental or enclosed bucket will be used during dredge to reduce turbidity and benthic impacts.

A copy of the joint permit application can be found on the Virginia Marine Resources Commission’s website (hyperlink).

COMPENSATORY MITIGATION:

The applicant has provided the following explanation why compensatory mitigation should not be required: Mitigation is not offered for this project, other than the dredging royalties to VMRC. There are no impacts to non-vegetated or vegetated wetlands, shellfish, shellfish leases, subaquatic vegetation or shallow water habitat.

Buu Nygren, the leader of the Navajo Nation, posted a selfie on Facebook, beaming as he stood shoulder to shoulder with President Trump at the White House.

The U.S. president had just signed executive orders to promote coal production, and Mr. Nygren was thrilled: “The harmful policies of the past have unfairly targeted coal, but those tides are turning,” he wrote.

The angry Facebook comments rolled in: Mr. Nygren had betrayed his people and his support of coal would lead to the degradation of the land and water, they said.

But other voices surfaced, too. Stop complaining, they said. Coal meant jobs.

For decades, coal has been a divisive subject in the Navajo Nation, which spans portions of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. As an economic engine for the region, it provides well-paid jobs on the reservation, where nearly 40 percent of the residents live in poverty. But it has also used up water, polluted the air and raised health concerns.

As elsewhere, coal production and coal power generation has slowed over the years on the reservation, as companies pivoted to cheaper forms of energy, like natural gas, and Biden-era policies sought to elevate greener forms of energy, like wind and solar.

With Mr. Trump’s re-election, however, and his exhortations to “drill, baby, drill,” along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s calls to “mine, baby, mine,” coal supporters, including Mr. Nygren, see the potential to boost coal jobs — or at least slow their departure.

This growth is expected to be driven by jobs in solar, energy storage systems and low-carbon electricity imports as

Singapore commits to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050

.

The nation’s power sector accounts for about 40 per cent of emissions and efforts are under way to reduce the carbon footprint of this sector, such as by increasing solar capacity and importing clean electricity, among other things.

Speaking on the final day of the Singapore International Energy Week conference, Ms Gan said the power sector is expected to continue expanding and hiring in the coming decade.

“We are pivoting towards cleaner energy sources and we will need more people with new skills.”

This includes jobs such as solar panel design and asset performance engineers, and specialists working on the design, operation and maintenance of subsea interconnectors.

Nascent areas such as carbon capture and storage will present more opportunities, she said.

The data came from manpower and workforce planning surveys commissioned by the Energy Market Authority (EMA).

Currently, Singapore’s power sector is dependent largely on natural gas, a fossil fuel, which is mainly piped in from its neighbours or imported from all over the world in liquified form.

As work is under way to explore cleaner energy forms, the Government has said that natural gas will continue to be a core part of Singapore’s energy mix.

EMA said in a statement on Oct 31 that the traditional power and gas workforce is expected to grow by about 13 per cent, or 800 workers, in the next 10 years.

This is driven by workforce growth in the electricity transmission and distribution, power generation and gas sub-sectors.

From 2022 to 2024, the power sector’s workforce grew by 4 per cent, or 310 workers, said Ms Gan. Professionals with technical expertise were especially in demand, she added, pointing to an increase of 180 engineers and 110 skilled technical officers among the number .

EMA said it will continue to collaborate with institutes of higher learning and industry partners to develop a skilled and future-ready workforce to drive the energy transition.

For example, the authority has partnered Ngee Ann Polytechnic on a revised curriculum for a diploma in electrical engineering. Separately, the Institute of Technical Education has introduced a new technical engineer diploma in electrical engineering.

EMA said it has refreshed its resources to highlight emerging trends, jobs and skill sets in demand across the energy sector. Such resources can help Singaporeans make more informed decisions on working in the sector .

Firms are also taking steps to strengthen its workforce by investing in them, Ms Gan noted.

For instance, Sembcorp Solar Singapore is partnering Singapore Polytechnic to upgrade the skill sets in the solar industry, with a goal to train up to 100 professionals by 2027.

Areas of focus include digital system design tools and the use of artificial intelligence-assisted remotely operated vehicles to inspect specific parts of floating solar farms.

At the same time, companies like SP Group is looking to maintain its underground electricity network through robotics and digitalisation, said Ms Gan.

Its maintenance team is training a robotic dog, which is equipped with video and thermal cameras, to make routine inspections safer and more efficient.

“We use robotics to help us in a safer and more sustainable way. It improves productivity as well and frees up the maintenance team so that humans can focus on higher-value work,” she said.

Mr Greg Brittian, director for Asia-Pacific at sustainability recruitment firm Acre, said that clean energy sector jobs will not only require technical expertise, but also people with the skills to be able to bridge technology, finance and strategy.

Besides rising demand for jobs like solar and grid engineers, carbon management specialists and energy data analysts, he said that there will also be a strong need for project managers and regional integration experts.

These roles can help advance cross-border grid connectivity across Asean as energy systems become increasingly interlinked, he said.

One challenge is for the workforce to keep pace as clean energy technologies evolve rapidly. Said Mr Brittian: “Singapore’s opportunity lies in its proven ability to respond quickly through collaboration between government, academia and industry.”

It will also be vital to retrain workers, especially those from adjacent sectors such as oil and gas, infrastructure or digital technology, and leverage their transferable skills for the clean energy sector, he added.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/892a103d26a20c31bdc64b9c6f50dee871ca929fb890645ce1e13ca1140d310f,N,,2025-10-31 08:18:32.662975

These units are portable, reliable and will secure consistent and affordable energy production in even the most remote corners of the U.P.”","(The Center Square) – The Republican-led Michigan House has passed a bipartisan bill package looking to encourage the use of nuclear energy in the state.

This will be done largely via tax incentives and taxpayer-funded grants.

The plan was first proposed by State Rep. Jamie Thompson, R-Brownstown. She hailed its passage as a great victory for Michigan and its citizens.

“Our state has long had significant manufacturing prowess, and these bills would create jobs and opportunity in the energy sector,” Bierlein said. “As this evolving technology continues to come online, job providers are going to be looking to states that have the proper foundation in place – with operational know-how, a workforce and adequate facilities – to accommodate production. Through these bills, we can assemble that foundation.”

House Bills 4124-29 lay out a number of different corporate tax credits –specifically for small modular nuclear reactors – education grant programs and employment incentives.

House Democrats have also expressed support for the plan, with some even sponsoring or joining as co-sponsors. They argued its passage will establish Michigan as a leader in “clean, reliable energy technology.”

“This package will help advance nuclear technology and build the talent pipeline that will power Michigan’s energy future,” said state Rep. Joey Andrews, D-St. Joseph. Andrews sponsored one of the bills. “By creating educational opportunities in the nuclear and hydrogen energy fields and providing pathways for students to stay, grow and build their careers right here at home, we’re positioning Michigan at the forefront of energy innovation and workforce development, securing a prosperous future for our state.”

According to fiscal analyses conducted by the state in the spring, the bills would cost the taxpayers an estimated:

• House Bill 4124: A drop in state revenue by about $2.5 million annually starting in 2026.

• House Bill 4125: Unclear “increased costs” for the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity.

• House Bill 4126: Creation of the Nuclear and Hydrogen Education Grant Program Fund with unspecified associated costs or a revenue source.

• House Bill 4127: No fiscal impact.

• House Bill 4128: An “indeterminate” loss in state revenue. The bill would prohibit a taxpayer from claiming a credit for more than 10 years and limit the total credit claimed for an individual taxpayer to $10 million.

• House Bill 4129: Unclear “increased costs” for the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity. Creation of the Nuclear and Hydrogen Graduate Attraction and Retention Program Fund with unspecified associated costs or a revenue source.

This is the second time the six-bill package was introduced, after it stalled in the legislature last year.

This time, the bills passed out of the House Energy Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. On Tuesday, they also passed the House. They have now been referred to the Senate for consideration in its Energy and Environment Committee.

Multiple environmental groups have expressed concern with the bills. The Michigan Chapter of the Sierra Club is one of those. It submitted testimony in March expressing its opposition to the bill package.

“While proponents claim small modular nuclear reactors are a clean and innovative energy solution, the reality is that they are an expensive, unproven technology that diverts critical public funds away from more cost-effective and immediately available renewable energy options,” said Tim Minotas, Sierra deputy legislative and political director. “Rather than subsidizing an industry with an uncertain future, our state should invest in proven, rapidly deployable clean energy sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, and battery storage.”

Supporters of the legislation said that these incentives will help advance nuclear and hydrogen energy as the next generation of energy for Michigan. Some even say it could be Michigan’s “only” energy option moving forward.

“In the U.P., small modular reactors are our most likely pathway forward,” said state Rep. Dave Prestin, R-Cedar River. “With the ridiculous new green energy mandates—which will never work—being forced here in Michigan, paired with the unreliability and astronomical expenses associated with wind and solar energy production, unique production methods like SMRs will be our only option.

Introduction

When I joined the hydropower community five years ago, the conversation around clean energy was very different. The focus was on how quickly renewables could grow to deliver net zero. Now, as the International Hydropower Association (IHA) marks its 30th anniversary, the focus is about how we keep energy systems secure, reliable and resilient as they transform.

Two recent publications have captured that shift for me: the IEA’s Renewables 2025 report and with that, their Executive Director, Fatih Birol’s renewed call for the world to stop treating hydropower as 'the forgotten giant of electricity.' Both point to the same reality: the clean-energy transition is accelerating - but speed alone is not enough. Only hydropower provides security and stability at scale.

From growth to security

The IEA Renewables 2025 report marks a turning point. It shows that global renewable capacity is set to nearly double between 2023 and 2028, meeting over 95% of power expansion worldwide. An expansion at this speed and scale raises the critical question: can power systems built for stability adapt to rapid change?

Hydropower, the established, stable and proven technology, doesn’t just generate clean, green electricity; it underpins energy security. It provides long-duration storage and grid stability through inertia, voltage control and black-start capability. It’s also largely a domestic resource built to last for generations and one of the few clean technologies that strengthens energy security on every front.

Most importantly, it will continue to do so in the future. The 2025 World Hydropower Outlook shows that in 2024, global hydropower generation rose 10% to 4,578 TWh, despite droughts in several regions. Installed capacity reached 1,443 GW, including 189 GW of pumped storage — more than 90% of the world’s energy storage. And another 600 GW of pumped storage is in development.

In other words, the backbone of the renewable grid already exists. The challenge now is to strengthen it.

Modernising the foundation

As Fatih Birol reminds us, hydropower provides a tried and tested foundation for the energy transition. We must cherish it.

Cherishing has practical implications because around 40% of the world’s hydropower plants are now over 40 years old. To turn 40 years assets into even more productive forever assets, they need reinvestment and modernisation, to support the variable renewable energies that are coming online rapidly.

Resilience in action

What is needed is a change in how we collectively look at grids. We need to reframe our focus from generation output to flexible systems that tolerate intermittent influxes. Hydropower can provide this security.

Solar and wind power provide essential energy, but they depend on the weather. Batteries can bridge short gaps but are measured in hours. Hydropower, by contrast, can respond instantly, sustain that response for weeks, and store energy across seasons. It is the technology that keeps renewable systems stable and keeps our lights on.

Furthermore, it is not reliant on long, complicated supply chains. Water and elevation is available in almost every country. Concrete is easy to produce and the turbine market buoyant.

Energy security for people

In many regions, decentralised hydropower remains one of the most practical ways to provide clean, reliable power to off-grid communities.

When done sustainably, hydropower of any scale builds jobs, skills and local resilience. That is why at IHA we always go back to the San José Declaration on Sustainable Hydropower: “sustainable hydropower is a clean, green, modern and affordable solution to climate change. Going forward, the only acceptable hydropower is sustainable hydropower”. For us, energy security and sustainability are inseparable.

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.
Texas Resiliency Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.
“I think that these technologies—wind, solar, storage, demand response—they’re not experiments anymore,” Boms said.
“They’re the backbone of the Texas grid and the economy.”","Texas’ efforts to maintain a resilient power grid in the face of rising demand and storm threats are being tested by the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy.

The Lone Star state is unique compared to others because it allowed the market to determine what resources to invest in, leading to extensive transmission lines transporting solar and wind energy. Those renewables are particularly abundant due to Texas’ extensive and sunny landscape, and have been supported by the state’s growth of battery storage.

“Texas is number one in wind and solar not by accident, but because we have the resources, the infrastructure, and the market design to make it happen,” said Matthew Boms, executive director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance under Advanced Energy United.

All of that is strained by President Donald Trump demanding the end of clean energy subsidies and restricting federal funding for renewables programs, provoking one Texas county to fight back in the courts.

“Infrastructure has been a big part of Texas’ success story in renewables,” said Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association. “A lot of this progress in Texas is under threat from recent acts in Congress and by the administration.”

“The challenge right now is from the federal government” which has “reduced and curtailed tax credits available to the solar and storage industries” and is “likely to decrease the amount of supply that comes online,” Gallagher said.

New Energy Landscape

Renewables helped make Texas’ grid more stable in the summer, but there’s still concern for the winter because “the Trump administration has responded by just completely making it so difficult to add more energy to the grid,” saidHannah Malus, vice president of strategy and advocacy at Clean Energy for America.

“The lives and livelihoods of Texans are just collateral damage resulting from this administration picking winners and losers and energy sources instead of just letting the market decide,” Malus said.

Wind and solar generation have been the fastest-growing sources of electricity in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas system—which maintains the state’s electric grid—since 2023 and are increasingly meeting rising demand, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

For example, from June 1 to Aug. 31, solar met 15.2% of all demand in the ERCOT system, according to the council’s data.

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.

Harris County—Texas’ largest county and home to Houston—in October sued the Environmental Protection Agency for canceling $250 million it was awarded to fund solar energy infrastructure in low-income communities. Other states and organizations have also filed challenges over the Solar For All program.

“The whole purpose of the grant is to lower skyrocketing energy costs, to create clean energy jobs, to improve community health safety and resilience, and, of course, to support domestic manufacturing,” said Christian Menefee, Harris County’s chief civil lawyer.

The county on Oct. 24 moved for a preliminary injunction to stop the EPA from implementing the cancellation of the program. The section of the July tax and spending bill that rescinds “unobligated balances” violates the Administrative Procedure Act and US Constitution, the motion said.

“I agree with the overall sentiment that this sector is poised to continue growing, but I think you’d have to be a bit foolish to think that that growth won’t be slowed or stunted because of the actions of the Trump administration,” Menefee said.

The EPA said it doesn’t comment on pending litigation since Solar For All is the subject of different lawsuits. The Energy Department and ERCOT didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

ERCOT’s CEO, Pablo Vegas, testified before Congress in March about the grid.

“A reliable grid must have a balanced mix of generation resources, especially with the ‘all of the above’ approach” found in Texas, he said.

Texas Resiliency

Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.

“ERCOT is mostly isolated from other grids in the country, and that means that Texas has more autonomy on how the market is designed and operated,” Boms said. This allows the state to avoid lengthy oversight processes from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the interstate transmission of gas and electricity.

The state’s infrastructure also plays a big role.

“There was a really important transmission build out that happened about 20 years ago to connect remote wind and solar projects to the urban hubs in Texas,” Boms said. That “allowed billions of dollars in private investment to flow into Texas because the transmission was in place.”

“Federal policies will have an impact, but generally speaking, the industry is here to stay, and it’s really up to state leadership,” he said.

There have been recent attempts in the state legislature to pass bills that would add obstacles for renewables, but they didn’t go far.

One Republican-led bill, SB 819, would have added new permit requirements on wind and solar generating facilities, according to law firm K&L Gates.

Another, SB 715—also led by state Republicans—would have moved up the effective dates of new generation reliability requirements, according to S&P Global.

“There have been threats over the last few legislative sessions and some anti-renewable proposals, but luckily, none of those have passed,” Boms said.

Texas also invested in stronger weatherization following Winter Storm Uri in 2021, which left about 4.5 million Texans without electricity during extremely low temperatures.

FERC and the North American Electric Reliability Corp. released a report the same year finding that natural gas-fired units represented 58% of all generating units experiencing unplanned outages and other issues at that time. Wind made up 27%, coal made up 6%, and solar made up 2%.

“I think that these technologies—wind, solar, storage, demand response—they’re not experiments anymore,” Boms said. “They’re the backbone of the Texas grid and the economy.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/ad4fbd2/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2d%2F63%2F179975d947c3bd49ff759c5d1216%2Fgettyimages-1303397752.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 10:18:05.917282

The bill now awaits the signature of Governor JB Pritzker, a supporter of the legislation. The energy omnibus is expected to deliver billions of dollars in energy savings to businesses and residents alike in Illinois. Businesses leaders from across the state have shown their support for CRGA Act and the role it will play in solidifying Illinois’ clean energy economy.

“In light of federal rollbacks of clean energy tax credits and environmental protections, it is more important than ever that Illinois remains steadfast in its commitment to creating a clean energy economy. Businesses will feel the effects of CRGA thanks to a more reliable grid in all conditions and an environment more conducive to quickly building clean energy,” said Micaela Preskill, State Advocacy Director at E2, the nonpartisan business group.

Earlier this month, E2 released its Clean Jobs Midwest report for Illinois which highlights the state as the region’s clean energy jobs leader. According to E2’s Clean Jobs America report – released in September – Illinois boasts the fifth most clean energy jobs in the country, trailing only California, Texas, Florida, and New York.

The following are statements from two clean energy business leaders in Illinois:

“This is a huge win for Illinois businesses and families alike. By investing in energy efficiency, battery storage, and a stronger grid, lawmakers have given companies like mine the certainty we need to keep hiring and growing in Illinois. This forward-looking policy will lower costs, create jobs, and ensure reliable power for everyone,” said Jamie Johnson, Founder of Verde Energy Efficiency. Energy efficiency comprises about two-thirds of Illinois’s clean energy jobs.

“Passage of the CRGA Act is a victory for clean energy, affordability, and Illinois workers. This bill gives our industry the stability to invest, expand, and create good jobs across the state. It’s exactly the kind of leadership we need to keep Illinois at the forefront of the clean-energy economy,” said Michelle Knox, Founder of WindSolarUSA.

New research shows a continuous pattern of air pollution violations from liquified natural gas export facilities in Southwest Louisiana.

Three LNG export facilities in Cameron Parish are featured in a report from the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit research organization.

Sourced from federal and state data, the report documents federal Clean Air Act infractions for each of the past 12 quarters – spanning three years – at Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass LNG terminal and Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal. The Cameron LNG export terminal in Hackberry has been out of compliance with the Clean Air Act for 11 of the past 12 quarters.

Report author and Environmental Integrity Project research manager Alexandra Shaykevich spoke at a press event about the “terrible compliance record” for the LNG industry, noting that Southwest Louisiana facilities in particular have been in “nearly continuous” violation of the Clean Air Act for the past three years.

Venture Global and Cameron LNG did not respond to requests for comment on the report. Cheniere Energy had no comment.

Cameron Parish resident John Allaire lives within 30 miles of the three LNG facilities highlighted in the report – and six more that are planned or under construction.

“I live in the eye of this LNG hurricane,” Allaire said at a news conference this week announcing the report’s release.

Allaire’s home sits close enough to the Venture Global facility for him to see fiery plumes of methane flares from his patio. The Commonwealth LNG facility is planned 750 feet away from his property line, he said.

“I’m surrounded on all sides,” he said. “It’s not the same coastal wetland estuary that it used to be.”

While each terminal provided varying explanations for its violations, Shaykevich said, common ones include:

failure to report excess emissions and permit deviations to state regulators;

exceeding allowed pollution limits for contaminants such as nitrous oxide, volatile organic compounds and sulphur dioxide; and

failure to properly operate equipment meant to control pollution levels.

Cameron LNG’s Clean Air Act violations included at least 89 instances of excess pollution that released thousands of pounds of benzine, a known carcinogen, from the facility into the surrounding environment, according to the report’s analysis of Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality records.

“We need these companies to actually be good neighbors and not to continue causing suffering in the communities in which they operate,” said James Hiatt, director of local nonprofit For a Better Bayou at the news conference.

Each of the three facilities had only two air enforcement actions opened from LDEQ, according to the report. Cheniere Energy had paid $225,000 in fines as of July 29, when state records were analyzed, for air quality violations. Financial penalties hadn’t yet been finalized for the other two facilities before the Environmental Integrity Project published its report.

The report also included tallies of Clean Water Act violations for LNG terminals in Southwest Louisiana. Sabine Pass was out of compliance with the act’s standards for 8 of the past 12 quarters. Cameron LNG had violations in seven quarters, and Calcasieu had just one quarter with water-related infractions.

Cameron LNG had 27 effluent violations from July 2020 through June 2025. Sabine Pass had nine and Calcasieu Pass recorded one over the same period, according to the report’s analysis. The violations at Cameron LNG and Sabine Pass involved fecal coliform and suspended solids, such as algae, bacteria and industrial particles. The lone issue at Calcalsieu Pass involved only suspended solids.

Shaykevich said the pattern of permit violations for existing facilities should be a factor in approving new facilities as the LNG industry continues its rapid expansion.

The initiative, led by Wabash Valley Resources (WVR), aims to bolster domestic fertilizer supply while cutting emissions at scale.

WVR recently secured a $1.559 billion US Department of Energy (DOE) loan, part of a federal effort to strengthen US energy independence by modernizing legacy industrial assets. The funding will support the restart and expansion of a former gasification plant in West Terre Haute, transforming it into a major producer of hydrogen-derived anhydrous ammonia.

At full capacity, the facility is expected to generate 500,000 metric tons of ammonia per year, helping meet agricultural demand across the Midwest. WVR projects the plant could replace half of current fertilizer imports for farmers in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and surrounding states, potentially easing price volatility in the region.

Large-Scale Carbon Capture for US Agriculture

Central to the project is Honeywell’s Advanced Solvent Carbon Capture (ASCC) technology, which will enable the facility to capture and permanently store nearly 1.65 million tons of CO2 annually.

According to Honeywell, that volume of CO2 is equivalent to the carbon absorbed by 1.65 million acres of US forest in a single year.

“As energy demand increases, Honeywell’s carbon capture technologies help customers like Wabash Valley Resources optimize operations and reduce emissions to help boost the domestic production of important inputs like ammonia to support American agriculture,” said Ken West, president and CEO of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions.

The center indicated that if Project 2025 were implemented, West Virginia residents would eventually:

Experience a tax increase of $2,185 for the average West Virginia family. People exceeding an annual income of $10 million would get a cut of $1.5 million.

Back then, President Donald Trump claimed he knew nothing about it. Yes, Trump never read it. However, he appointed Russell Vought — the mastermind behind Project 2025 — to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Post election, Trump stated he would be meeting with “Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.”

In his second term, Trump has been following Project 2025 right down to the smallest details.

For example:

— Under Project 2025, the Affordable Care Act (p 468) was to be gutted. Medicaid expansion would be limited by adding bureaucratic, unenforceable “work requirements.” Mission accomplished and numerous West Virginia residents will suffer.

— Project 2025 politicizes health care, stating, “Cultural institutions like public libraries and public health agencies are only as ‘independent’ from public accountability as elected officials and voters permit.” Classifying public health departments as “cultural” versus health care provisions opens public health up to politics. Thus, it opens the way for a lawyer like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to be undercutting science and redefining the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccines policy. Mission accomplished.

— The conservative plan advocated doing away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (p 869) which it incorrectly classifies “as a shakedown mechanism to provide unaccountable funding to leftist nonprofits politically aligned with those who spearheaded its creation.” The Trump administration is vocally advocating for this approach and is well on its way to succeeding. Thus, consumers will again be left with no advocate for their interests while big business (Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, etc.) contributes money to the MAGA cause.

— Project 2025 (p 693) advocates “legislation that would ‘effectively abolish’ the Federal Reserve and replace it with ‘free banking,’ whereby ‘neither interest rates nor the supply of money’ would be ‘controlled by government.’” Trump’s moves to gain control of the Fed are the first step towards accomplishing this goal. Such a move would have disastrous economic consequences, leading to another Great Depression.

— Project 2025’s plan is to slash the size of the federal workforce (p 20), politicizing it while hindering its ability to function. This is based on the radical right assumption that there exists a “largely underworked, over-compensated, and unaccountable federal civilian workforce.” Along the same lines, the Trump administration is advised to “fill its ranks with political appointees” who would “overcome the federal government’s obstructionist Human Resources departments.” Mission accomplished.

— The federal Department of Education (c11, p365) would be abolished, and student aid slashed under Project 2025(c11, p385). Our public education system (c11, p390) would be undercut in favor of a stronger private sector presence. Trump is implementing these policies.

— Project 2025 slashes environmental regulations on businesses (c13, p440) while gutting Environmental Protection Agency regulations as well (p425/p 450). The strange rationale given is that the EPA is a “breeding ground for expansion of federal government influence” and that Democrats have a “global climate themed agenda.” Clearly, the authors want to ignore the severe climate threat facing the world.

— Energy production via fossil fuels would be increased on federal lands (c16, p600) while federal funding for renewable energy projects would be cut (c12, p405). “A new Administration must immediately roll back Biden’s orders, reinstate the Trump-era Energy Dominance Agenda” (p 521). The Trump administration is implementing these policies while the environmental impact of these changes is ignored.

The bill that cleared the General Assembly Thursday funds energy storage systems through a new charge to Illinois electric customers that will take effect in 2030. The bill also lifts a longtime ban on new nuclear power developments and gives new authority to state utility regulators.

Proponents say the bill will lower costs for utility customers, but critics worry that a lack of cost-control measures will increase electricity prices for Illinois residents.

“Here’s the bottom line in my view: this package is about making energy more affordable for ratepayers in years ahead. We’re getting more energy on the grid,” bill sponsor Sen. Steve Stadelman, D-Rockford, said Thursday. “If we do nothing… the rates are going to continue to go up.”

The Illinois Senate approved Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — Thursday evening, 37-22. That follows the House of Representatives approving it Wednesday night, 70-37.

It next heads to Gov. JB Pritzker, who pledged to sign the bill Thursday, noting that “what we’re trying to do is lower electricity costs.”

Pritzker’s office was heavily involved in negotiations around the bill throughout its tumultuous legislative history.

Versions of the bill date back to negotiations in 2024, with initial talks of an energy package cropping up in the weeks ahead of a January 2025 lame duck session. Drafts of the bill circulated throughout the spring legislative session before ultimately being abandoned.

What’s in the bill?

Senate Bill 25 — which supporters call the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — is the largest change to Illinois’ energy policy in at least four years. Among its core policies:

Battery storage. The core of the bill is a new incentive structure for energy storage projects. The incentives are broadly similar to how the state funds renewable developments like wind and solar power. They will result in new charges to ratepayers, although proponents say that savings from more storage on the grid will offset costs.

Energy efficiency. The bill adds new requirements for energy efficiency programs at natural gas and electric utilities. These are aimed at reducing energy demand and proponents of the measure say they will lower prices for consumers.

Nuclear power. The bill lifts a longstanding moratorium on large-scale nuclear power plants, but it also hikes fees for nuclear plant operators.

New authority for regulators. The Illinois Commerce Commission, the state’s utility regulator, would gain new authority for “integrated resource planning,” a way of setting long-term plans to control both supply-side issues, like plans for electric generation, as well as managing demand.

Labor protections. New requirements for community solar projects would close a loophole that some developers were using to avoid hiring union labor. This was a major priority for organized labor groups during negotiations.

Data centers air regulations. The bill places new requirements on the backup generators used by data centers, which require always-on power to operate.

Virtual power plants and time-of-use. The bill requires large utilities to create “virtual power plant” programs and time-of-use rate plans. This allows utilities to use small-scale residential solar and battery projects to deliver energy throughout the day.

Geothermal energy. The bill outlines a program to fund geothermal heating, a technology which uses naturally occurring heat from underground to offset the need for electric or fossil fuel-based heating.

Thermal energy networks. A new state-backed loan program would fund thermal energy network projects. These use water-filled pipes to transfer heat between energy-intensive buildings, wastewater systems and bodies of water. They can also use geothermal energy to manage heat.

Renewable industry, environmentalists celebrate

A cadre of advocacy groups, renewable industry associations and lawmakers praised the bill’s passage.

The governor said the bill was a positive step toward affordability at a time when renewable energy faces expensive headwinds across the U.S.

“For far too long, private grid operators have been hiking up rates that are making it harder for Illinois families to pay their utility bills,” Pritzker said in a statement. “At the same time, the Trump Administration has been blocking the ability to bring lower-cost energy options online.”

President Donald Trump’s domestic policy package, passed earlier this summer, sent shockwaves through the renewable industry as it ended subsidies and incentives for electric vehicles, wind power projects, solar installation and other policies key to funding renewable development.

David Braun, head of sales and marketing for the Illinois-based renewable tech company Intelligent Generation, said that law caused “a lot of shock and uncertainty” but that the industry was “figuring it out.”

Illinois’ bill, according to Braun, signals that the future is bright for renewables.

“It’s good news for the industry, and I think it’s good news for the state of Illinois and for ratepayers,” Braun said.

The bill incentivizes new storage projects, which state officials at the Illinois Power Agency found will suppress electricity prices in an analysis they provided to lawmakers. It also mandates new programs to decrease strain on the grid, like energy efficiency programs.

Amy Heart, senior vice president for policy at the California-based solar company Sunrun, said the bill’s “virtual power plant” program will allow utilities to aggregate resources like residential solar and storage installations and coordinate them.

“The idea of utilizing electrons that are already stored in the batteries that are in houses and businesses — but adding them all up and dispatching them at times we need them the most in Illinois — reduces the amount of energy that ComEd or Ameren has to go to the wholesale market and buy from other states,” Heart said.

Environmental groups also praised the bill, with representatives of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and others saying the policy was a major step in keeping prices low.

“The legislation bolsters tools and programs the state needs to achieve its clean energy goals and rebukes recent federal efforts to undermine abundant, cost-effective wind and solar power,” James Gignac, Midwest policy director for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement.

After a prolonged negotiation, labor groups also signed on to support the bill. They held out full support until lawmakers moved to close a loophole that allowed community solar developers to avoid using project labor agreements. Joe Duffy, head of the labor-affiliated Climate Jobs Illinois, lauded the bill’s passage. He noted that it “ensures the clean energy transition delivers good-paying, local union jobs.”

Criticism from Republicans, business groups

While affordability was at the center of proponents’ commendations of the policy, it was also central to critics’ attacks. The bill’s energy storage funding mechanism will put a guaranteed increase to Illinois consumers’ utility bills, which sparked significant opposition from Republicans, business groups and some Democrats.

Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, broke with his party as one of three Senate Democrats to vote against the bill. Sen. Michael Hastings, D-Frankfort, and Sen. Patrick Joyce, D-Essex, also voted no.

“This is about standing for integrity, for people who do not have armies of lobbyists down here giving talking points to people to justify raising their bills when they’re already struggling,” Preston said. “I have to vote no.”

Preston had advocated for an alternative funding mechanism — one that used state-backed loans and not an increase to ratepayers — in the months leading up to the bill’s passage.

Groups representing large businesses cited similar concerns. Illinois Industrial Electric Consumers Chair Phillip Golden said the bill’s funding “makes no sense, especially when the same objectives are achievable without forcing more costs on ratepayers.”

Business groups and Republicans also raised concerns over a provision that grants the Illinois Commerce Commission, which regulates utilities, the authority to create long-term “integrated resource plans.” These plans could include goals for the supply of electricity and managing demand.

By giving the ICC that authority, according to critics, the General Assembly is ceding too much authority to the executive branch.

“This is a huge overreach by the governor’s administration,” Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, said. “In this bill, he just gave all of the power for energy making decisions to the ICC — five unelected officials that he appoints.”

Rezin, a long-time advocate for allowing more nuclear construction in the state, said the bill’s elimination of the state’s nuclear moratorium might not mean more nuclear power because of the authority granted to the governor’s appointees.

“Do you think they’re going to bring nuclear online? In the past, they’ve shown they don’t support it,” Rezin said. “They’re going to go towards wind, solar, battery and transmission.”

Geological Distribution and Regional Concentrations South Africa's critical minerals exhibit distinct geographical clustering that creates both opportunities and infrastructure challenges.
Competitive Disadvantage Analysis Global mining investment flows increasingly favour jurisdictions offering comprehensive support packages for critical mineral projects.
Future policy developments will likely determine whether this approach can achieve its dual objectives of sustainable resource development and global competitiveness in critical mineral supply chains.
Ready to Capitalise on Critical Minerals Investment Opportunities?","What Defines South Africa's Thin-Incentive Critical Minerals Strategy?

South Africa's thin-incentive critical minerals strategy has adopted what industry analysts describe as a minimal-incentive approach to critical minerals development, standing in stark contrast to the aggressive financial packages offered by competing mining jurisdictions. This strategic framework prioritises regulatory stability and sustainable development over short-term investment attraction through tax breaks and subsidies.

The thin-incentive model operates through several key mechanisms that distinguish it from international competitors. Unlike the Australian tax incentives with substantial research and development tax credits or Canada's flow-through share programs, South Africa maintains standard corporate tax rates across all mineral categories without differentiation for strategic resources.

Core Elements of the Thin-Incentive Framework:

Uniform royalty structures applied regardless of mineral classification

Limited government co-funding for exploration activities

Standard regulatory treatment across commodity types

Absence of specialised tax holidays for critical mineral projects

Minimal direct government investment in mining infrastructure

This approach reflects a broader philosophy that sustainable mining development should rely on strong geological fundamentals rather than artificial fiscal incentives. The strategy assumes that South Africa's exceptional mineral endowments will attract investment based on resource quality and long-term profitability rather than short-term tax advantages.

Comparative Analysis with Global Mining Jurisdictions

The contrast between South Africa's approach and international best practices becomes apparent when examining specific policy mechanisms. Australia's Exploration Development Incentive provides direct tax credits for grassroots mineral exploration, whilst Canada's Super Flow-Through Share programme offers enhanced tax deductions for critical mineral investments.

Policy Tool South Africa Australia Canada Chile Exploration Tax Credits None Up to 100% 15-25% additional Regional variations Royalty Relief Programmes Standard rates Project-specific Provincial discretion Sliding scale Infrastructure Co-funding Limited Substantial Federal-provincial State investment Fast-track Permitting Standard process Expedited for critical minerals Enhanced review Streamlined approvals

Understanding South Africa's Critical Minerals Classification System

The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy has developed a comprehensive strategic minerals list that identifies resources based on economic significance, supply chain vulnerability, and technological importance. This classification system represents one of the most detailed national assessments of critical mineral resources globally.

Tier 1 Strategic Minerals (Dominant Global Position):

Platinum Group Metals: South Africa controls approximately 80% of global platinum reserves and 70% of rhodium reserves

Manganese: The country possesses roughly 75% of identified global manganese reserves, primarily in the Northern Cape's Kalahari Manganese Field

Chrome Ore: Contains nearly 70% of world chrome reserves, concentrated in the Bushveld Complex

Vanadium: Holds about 45% of global vanadium reserves

Tier 2 Strategic Resources (Significant but Competitive):

Iron Ore: Substantial reserves in the Northern Cape, though not globally dominant

Titanium Minerals: Significant heavy mineral sands deposits along the eastern coast

Rare Earth Elements: Emerging potential in various geological formations

Gold: Declining but still economically important reserves

The classification system extends beyond simple reserve calculations to include processing capabilities, downstream beneficiation potential, and strategic trade relationships. This multidimensional approach recognises that raw mineral abundance alone does not guarantee strategic advantage in global supply chains.

Geological Distribution and Regional Concentrations

South Africa's critical minerals exhibit distinct geographical clustering that creates both opportunities and infrastructure challenges. The Bushveld Igneous Complex represents one of the world's most significant repositories of strategic minerals, containing the majority of global platinum group metal reserves alongside substantial chrome and vanadium resources.

Key Mining Regions:

Bushveld Complex (Limpopo and North West Provinces): Primary source of platinum, palladium, rhodium, chrome, and vanadium

Witwatersrand Basin (Gauteng): Historic gold production region with ongoing deep-level operations

Kalahari Manganese Field (Northern Cape): World's largest manganese ore deposits

Aggeneys-Gamsberg Area (Northern Cape): Zinc, lead, and emerging copper resources

Core Components of the Strategic Framework

South Africa's thin-incentive critical minerals strategy operates through multiple policy mechanisms designed to maximise domestic value addition whilst maintaining export competitiveness. The framework emphasises downstream beneficiation as a pathway to economic diversification and industrial development.

Primary Strategic Objectives:

Value Addition Mandate: Encouraging local processing of raw minerals before export

Technology Transfer: Facilitating knowledge sharing between international investors and domestic entities

Skills Development: Building local expertise in specialised mining and processing technologies

Supply Chain Integration: Creating linkages between mining operations and manufacturing sectors

Sustainable Development: Ensuring environmental and social responsibility in resource extraction

The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act provides the regulatory foundation for this approach, establishing requirements for Social and Labour Plans that mandate local community investment and skills development programmes. Furthermore, the government has explored mineral beneficiation opportunities as a key component of industrial development.

Beneficiation Requirements and Implementation Challenges

The concurrent review of beneficiation policies reflects ongoing tensions between immediate revenue generation through raw material exports and long-term economic development through value-added processing. Current regulations require mining companies to demonstrate efforts toward local beneficiation without imposing absolute restrictions on raw material exports.

Implementation Complexities:

Power Supply Constraints: Unreliable electricity supply affects energy-intensive processing operations

Water Resource Limitations: Processing facilities require substantial water resources in water-scarce regions

Skills Shortages: Limited availability of specialised technical expertise for advanced processing technologies

Capital Requirements: High upfront investment costs for beneficiation infrastructure

Market Access: Challenges in competing with established international processing centres

Why Industry Analysts Question This Approach

Mining industry experts have raised concerns about South Africa's ability to attract sufficient investment under current policy frameworks, particularly when competing against jurisdictions offering substantial financial incentives for critical mineral development.

Primary Investment Barriers:

Regulatory Uncertainty: Unclear implementation timelines for new mining legislation and beneficiation requirements

Infrastructure Deficits: Persistent challenges with electricity supply, rail transportation, and port capacity

Administrative Complexity: Lengthy permitting processes and multiple regulatory approvals required

Political Risk Perceptions: International investor concerns about policy stability and property rights

Labour Relations: Ongoing tensions between mining companies and labour unions affecting operational predictability

Additionally, the approach contrasts sharply with the critical minerals strategy pivot seen in other jurisdictions that prioritise aggressive investment attraction through fiscal incentives.

Competitive Disadvantage Analysis

Global mining investment flows increasingly favour jurisdictions offering comprehensive support packages for critical mineral projects. The United States Inflation Reduction Act provides substantial tax credits for domestic critical mineral processing, whilst the European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act establishes fast-track permitting for strategic projects.

Investment Attractiveness Factor Weighting South Africa Score Global Average Geological Prospectivity 30% 9.2/10 6.5/10 Policy Stability 25% 6.1/10 7.2/10 Fiscal Competitiveness 20% 5.8/10 7.0/10 Infrastructure Quality 15% 5.5/10 6.8/10 Regulatory Efficiency 10% 5.2/10 6.9/10

According to recent G20 analysis, South Africa's approach has been characterised as having limited incentive structures compared to global best practices.

Global Supply Chain Implications

South Africa's strategic importance in global critical mineral supply chains extends far beyond its domestic economic interests, with policy decisions affecting international technology development, renewable energy deployment, and automotive manufacturing. However, this also plays into broader critical minerals energy transition considerations globally.

Critical Supply Chain Positions:

Automotive Catalysts: Platinum and palladium essential for internal combustion engine emissions control

Hydrogen Economy: Platinum group metals crucial for fuel cell technology development

Stainless Steel Production: Chrome ore fundamental to stainless steel manufacturing globally

Battery Technology: Emerging importance of manganese in next-generation battery chemistries

Infrastructure Development: Vanadium increasingly important for energy storage applications

The concentration of global supply in South African operations creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities for international supply chains. Geopolitical tensions, labour disputes, or infrastructure failures can have immediate global impacts on critical technology sectors.

Regional Integration and SADC Cooperation

The Southern African Development Community framework provides opportunities for regional integration of critical mineral value chains, though implementation remains limited. Zambia's copper resources, Botswana's diamond operations, and Zimbabwe's platinum deposits could complement South African production within integrated regional supply chains.

Regional Integration Challenges:

Infrastructure Connectivity: Limited transportation links between regional mining operations

Regulatory Harmonisation: Different mining codes and tax systems across SADC member states

Currency Stability: Exchange rate volatility affecting cross-border investment flows

Skills Mobility: Barriers to movement of technical expertise across regional boundaries

Long-Term Consequences of Minimal Investment Incentives

South Africa's thin-incentive critical minerals strategy may result in delayed development of critical mineral projects, potentially affecting both domestic economic objectives and international supply security. This outcome could have significant implications for South Africa's position in global mineral markets.

Potential Positive Outcomes:

Fiscal Sustainability: Reduced government expenditure on mining subsidies

Project Selectivity: Focus on economically robust projects with strong fundamentals

Sustainable Development: Emphasis on long-term value creation rather than short-term extraction

Technology Development: Incentivising innovation in processing and beneficiation technologies

Risk Scenarios:

Investment Diversion: Loss of potential projects to more competitive jurisdictions

Delayed Development: Slower pace of new mine development and expansion projects

Technology Gaps: Limited adoption of advanced mining and processing technologies

Market Share Loss: Gradual erosion of global market position in key commodities

Alternative Development Models and International Precedents

Several countries have successfully implemented differentiated incentive structures specifically targeting critical minerals whilst maintaining overall fiscal discipline. Norway's Government Pension Fund provides patient capital for strategic mineral investments, while Chile's lithium strategy balances resource conservation with development incentives.

As outlined in Africa Policy Institute analysis, there are both promises and paradoxes in South Africa's current approach that require careful consideration.

Successful Alternative Models:

Targeted Tax Credits: Specific incentives for critical mineral processing rather than broad-based mining subsidies

Infrastructure Co-investment: Government participation in strategic transportation and power infrastructure

Research and Development Support: Public funding for mining technology innovation and skills development

Fast-track Permitting: Expedited regulatory approval processes for strategic mineral projects

Export Financing: Government-backed financing for critical mineral trade relationships

Enhancing South Africa's Critical Minerals Competitiveness

Policy refinements could address current limitations whilst maintaining fiscal responsibility and sustainable development principles. Targeted interventions could improve investment attractiveness without abandoning the core philosophy of the thin-incentive approach, particularly considering broader mining industry innovation trends.

Strategic Enhancement Opportunities:

Infrastructure Investment Programmes: Government-led improvements in electricity supply reliability and rail transportation capacity

Regulatory Streamlining: Clear timelines and single-window approval processes for critical mineral projects

Technology Partnerships: Enhanced collaboration between government research institutions and private mining companies

Skills Development Initiatives: Specialised training programmes for advanced mining and processing technologies

Export Promotion: Trade facilitation measures for value-added mineral products

Implementation Timeline and Practical Considerations

Effective policy modifications require careful sequencing to avoid disrupting existing operations whilst encouraging new investment. Gradual implementation of enhanced incentives could test effectiveness before broader application across the mining sector.

Phase 1 (Immediate – 6 months):

Regulatory clarity on beneficiation requirements

Infrastructure investment announcements

Fast-track permitting pilot programmes

Phase 2 (Short-term – 12-24 months):

Targeted tax incentives for processing facilities

Skills development programme implementation

Technology transfer facilitation mechanisms

Phase 3 (Medium-term – 2-5 years):

Infrastructure project completion

Full regulatory framework implementation

Performance evaluation and adjustment

Strategic Implications for Investors and Industry Stakeholders

Understanding South Africa's thin-incentive critical minerals strategy helps inform investment decisions and strategic planning for companies involved in critical mineral supply chains. Long-term investors may find opportunities in the current framework's emphasis on sustainable development and resource optimisation.

Investment Strategy Considerations:

Project Economics: Higher reliance on commodity price cycles and operational efficiency rather than fiscal incentives

Partnership Approaches: Collaboration with local entities may provide operational and regulatory advantages

Technology Focus: Emphasis on innovative processing and beneficiation technologies to maximise value addition

Risk Management: Comprehensive assessment of infrastructure, regulatory, and political risk factors

Market Positioning: Understanding of global supply chain dynamics and long-term demand trends

Stakeholder Engagement Priorities:

Government Relations: Active participation in policy development and regulatory consultation processes

Community Investment: Substantial commitment to local economic development and social responsibility

Environmental Compliance: Proactive approach to environmental management and rehabilitation

Skills Development: Investment in local capacity building and technology transfer

Supply Chain Integration: Development of domestic linkages and value-added processing capabilities

The success of South Africa's thin-incentive critical minerals strategy ultimately depends on balancing fiscal discipline with investment attractiveness whilst leveraging the country's exceptional geological advantages. Future policy developments will likely determine whether this approach can achieve its dual objectives of sustainable resource development and global competitiveness in critical mineral supply chains.

This analysis is based on current policy frameworks and industry assessments as of October 2025. Mining investment decisions should consider multiple factors including geological, technical, regulatory, and market considerations. Readers should consult current government publications and industry reports for the most recent policy developments.

Those policy changes are slowing the transition to electric vehicles.
But executives are also consistently saying they still plan to invest in electric vehicles.
Partly, that's because of competitive pressure, as Chinese automakers make increasingly attractive and affordable electric vehicles.","Automakers have been footing a hefty tariff bill — to the tune of $30 billion across the industry this year, according to a recent analysis from Moody's.

The industry is also grappling with a shortage of semiconductors, leaving them without the chips they need to build some vehicles, as well as a fire at an aluminum plant that's hurting the supply chain for Ford and Stellantis.

Despite those headwinds, quarterly earnings reports from automakers are so far showing resilience. General Motors reported $3.4 billion in profits last quarter and Ford brought in $2.6 billion, both beating expectations. Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, increased its revenues by 13% year over year. Hyundai, despite seeing a 29% decline in profits compared to the same quarter last year, still plans to meet its targets for the year.

Volkswagen Group, on the other hand, reported a more than billion-dollar loss, as it faced the combined costs of tariffs and Porsche's pivot from electric vehicles back to gasoline.

Part of the reason for automakers' positive reports is that Trump lowered tariffs on goods from Japan and Europe from 25% to 15%, and just recently announced a similar deal with Korea. While a 15% tariff is still substantial, the changes were welcomed by automakers.

Meanwhile, a recent policy change eased the burden of tariffs on imported parts that go into U.S.-built cars.

Automakers' bottom lines are also getting a boost from rising car prices. Companies have been cautious about passing tariff costs along to consumers, in part because cars are already so expensive — over $50,000 on average, according to Kelley Blue Book. There are real questions about how much more consumers are willing or able to pay. But gradual increases are now visible. Across the industry, prices are up about .5% this year, Ford says.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration's rollback of environmental rules is benefitting some automakers substantially — in particular, changes to emissions requirements that used to penalize automakers if they made too many high-polluting vehicles.

Suddenly, automakers do not have to manufacture electric vehicles, which they have struggled to make profitably. And they can build as many large pickup trucks as they can sell — which are both more polluting and more profitable. That's been a boost to companies like GM, Stellantis and Ford, offsetting the costs of tariffs.

Of course, that same policy change is a setback for all-electric automakers like Tesla and Rivian. Under the previous rules, automakers that wanted to make gas guzzlers could pay EV manufacturers for ""regulatory credits,"" allowing them to borrow their rivals' green halos — and comply with federal rules. Now, that revenue stream for EV makers is being eliminated.

Tesla had strong sales last quarter, helped by the rush to buy EVs as consumers tried to take advantage of the now-eliminated consumer EV tax credit. But profits fell. (On Tesla's quarterly call with investors, Musk, as usual, was less interested in talking about those EV sales and much more interested in talking about the humanoid robots that he plans to sell.) Rivian is expected to report earnings next week.

Those policy changes are slowing the transition to electric vehicles. GM is ending production of its electric commercial van, and Stellantis is leaning heavily into inefficient Hemi engines, as a new CEO pivots away from a previous focus on electrification.

But executives are also consistently saying they still plan to invest in electric vehicles. ""EVs remain our North Star,"" said Mary Barra, explaining that GM will continue to work on improved EV batteries.

Partly, that's because of competitive pressure, as Chinese automakers make increasingly attractive and affordable electric vehicles. But automakers also know that just as the Trump administration did a U-turn on EVs, a future administration might once again make climate change and air pollution major priorities.

""We expect adoption will increase over time and the market [will] continue to evolve — and maybe even regulations evolve,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley told investors.

So Ford still plans to move forward with a $30,000 electric pickup, despite the lack of federal tax credits or regulations that would encourage it. ""We think this product is literally at the center of the future of the EV market in the U.S.,"" Farley said.

One of Australia's largest electricity companies, AGL, is preparing to shed hundreds of jobs as part of a massive restructure aimed at freeing up capital to accelerate its transition away from coal and towards renewables.

The company owns the Bayswater coal-fired power station in the Hunter Valley and the Loy Yang A plant in the Latrobe Valley, which the Victorian government is paying to keep operating until 2035.

In a presentation to workers earlier today, AGL — whose biggest shareholder is billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes — announced its plans to cut up to 300 positions from the two coal-fired stations and across the company's hydro sites.

""As we transition our portfolio, and connect our customers to a sustainable future, we need to ensure that today's business remains productive and competitive in this changing market while we continue to invest in our business for tomorrow,"" AGL said in a statement.

""As part of this focus, we're proposing changes to our organisational structure and reviewing both labour and non-labour costs to improve productivity and embed cost discipline across the enterprise.""

Hunter region reels from potential job losses

The news caps off a difficult week for the New South Wales Hunter Region after Rio Tinto announced it was considering closing its Tomago aluminium smelter — an AGL customer — which employs more than 1,000 workers.

Mining and Energy Union general secretary Grahame Kelly described AGL's restructure as a ""kick in the guts for power station workers in the lead up to Christmas"" and warned government intervention may be needed.

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.
Texas Resiliency Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.
“I think that these technologies—wind, solar, storage, demand response—they’re not experiments anymore,” Boms said.
“They’re the backbone of the Texas grid and the economy.”","Texas’ efforts to maintain a resilient power grid in the face of rising demand and storm threats are being tested by the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy.

The Lone Star state is unique compared to others because it allowed the market to determine what resources to invest in, leading to extensive transmission lines transporting solar and wind energy. Those renewables are particularly abundant due to Texas’ extensive and sunny landscape, and have been supported by the state’s growth of battery storage.

“Texas is number one in wind and solar not by accident, but because we have the resources, the infrastructure, and the market design to make it happen,” said Matthew Boms, executive director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance under Advanced Energy United.

All of that is strained by President Donald Trump demanding the end of clean energy subsidies and restricting federal funding for renewables programs, provoking one Texas county to fight back in the courts.

“Infrastructure has been a big part of Texas’ success story in renewables,” said Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association. “A lot of this progress in Texas is under threat from recent acts in Congress and by the administration.”

“The challenge right now is from the federal government” which has “reduced and curtailed tax credits available to the solar and storage industries” and is “likely to decrease the amount of supply that comes online,” Gallagher said.

New Energy Landscape

Renewables helped make Texas’ grid more stable in the summer, but there’s still concern for the winter because “the Trump administration has responded by just completely making it so difficult to add more energy to the grid,” saidHannah Malus, vice president of strategy and advocacy at Clean Energy for America.

“The lives and livelihoods of Texans are just collateral damage resulting from this administration picking winners and losers and energy sources instead of just letting the market decide,” Malus said.

Wind and solar generation have been the fastest-growing sources of electricity in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas system—which maintains the state’s electric grid—since 2023 and are increasingly meeting rising demand, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

For example, from June 1 to Aug. 31, solar met 15.2% of all demand in the ERCOT system, according to the council’s data.

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.

Harris County—Texas’ largest county and home to Houston—in October sued the Environmental Protection Agency for canceling $250 million it was awarded to fund solar energy infrastructure in low-income communities. Other states and organizations have also filed challenges over the Solar For All program.

“The whole purpose of the grant is to lower skyrocketing energy costs, to create clean energy jobs, to improve community health safety and resilience, and, of course, to support domestic manufacturing,” said Christian Menefee, Harris County’s chief civil lawyer.

The county on Oct. 24 moved for a preliminary injunction to stop the EPA from implementing the cancellation of the program. The section of the July tax and spending bill that rescinds “unobligated balances” violates the Administrative Procedure Act and US Constitution, the motion said.

“I agree with the overall sentiment that this sector is poised to continue growing, but I think you’d have to be a bit foolish to think that that growth won’t be slowed or stunted because of the actions of the Trump administration,” Menefee said.

The EPA said it doesn’t comment on pending litigation since Solar For All is the subject of different lawsuits. The Energy Department and ERCOT didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

ERCOT’s CEO, Pablo Vegas, testified before Congress in March about the grid.

“A reliable grid must have a balanced mix of generation resources, especially with the ‘all of the above’ approach” found in Texas, he said.

Texas Resiliency

Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.

“ERCOT is mostly isolated from other grids in the country, and that means that Texas has more autonomy on how the market is designed and operated,” Boms said. This allows the state to avoid lengthy oversight processes from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the interstate transmission of gas and electricity.

The state’s infrastructure also plays a big role.

“There was a really important transmission build out that happened about 20 years ago to connect remote wind and solar projects to the urban hubs in Texas,” Boms said. That “allowed billions of dollars in private investment to flow into Texas because the transmission was in place.”

“Federal policies will have an impact, but generally speaking, the industry is here to stay, and it’s really up to state leadership,” he said.

There have been recent attempts in the state legislature to pass bills that would add obstacles for renewables, but they didn’t go far.

One Republican-led bill, SB 819, would have added new permit requirements on wind and solar generating facilities, according to law firm K&L Gates.

Another, SB 715—also led by state Republicans—would have moved up the effective dates of new generation reliability requirements, according to S&P Global.

“There have been threats over the last few legislative sessions and some anti-renewable proposals, but luckily, none of those have passed,” Boms said.

Texas also invested in stronger weatherization following Winter Storm Uri in 2021, which left about 4.5 million Texans without electricity during extremely low temperatures.

FERC and the North American Electric Reliability Corp. released a report the same year finding that natural gas-fired units represented 58% of all generating units experiencing unplanned outages and other issues at that time. Wind made up 27%, coal made up 6%, and solar made up 2%.

“I think that these technologies—wind, solar, storage, demand response—they’re not experiments anymore,” Boms said. “They’re the backbone of the Texas grid and the economy.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/ad4fbd2/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2d%2F63%2F179975d947c3bd49ff759c5d1216%2Fgettyimages-1303397752.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 12:08:35.682857

But for an industry that helped define America’s middle class, it might just be the cost of taking the driver’s seat again.","America’s automotive industry is being forced into one of its most dramatic realignments in decades — and it’s not because of electric vehicles, new emissions mandates, or the latest design trends. This time, the shift is driven by tariffs.

According to a new report from the Anderson Economic Group (AEG), U.S. automakers have already paid more than $10 billion in tariffs this year on vehicles and parts imported from Canada and Mexico. That’s not a typo — $10 billion, and counting.

These costs aren’t just numbers on a balance sheet. They’re reshaping where companies build, how they source materials, and even which vehicles Americans will be able to buy in the coming years.

A price tag on globalization

The Anderson report, released October 16, offers a detailed look at how trade policy is rippling through the automotive economy. Between January and July 2025 alone, automakers incurred $6.45 billion in duties on North American imports. By the end of October, that figure is projected to exceed $10.6 billion, factoring in delayed Census Bureau corrections and missing import data.

AEG’s CEO, Patrick L. Anderson, emphasized that this number still understates the real cost. It only includes two major categories of vehicle imports and excludes separate tariffs on steel, aluminum, and imports from Europe or Asia.

That means the real financial hit could be significantly higher — a reality that’s already affecting corporate strategy and consumer prices.

Trump’s “build it here” tariff doctrine

At the heart of this transformation is a simple message from former President Donald Trump: build it in America, or pay the price.

During an April White House press event announcing his reciprocal tariff policy, Trump declared:

“If you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product right here in America, because there is no tariff if you build your plant, your product in America.”

His goal, he said, was to rebalance decades of offshoring that sent millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs abroad. And the policy is beginning to do exactly that.

While critics argue that tariffs can raise prices for consumers, supporters note that they also create strong incentives for domestic production — and recent corporate moves suggest the message is being heard loud and clear.

Stellantis makes its move

The most dramatic example so far comes from Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, and Ram.

In April, Stellantis temporarily paused production at two major assembly plants — one in Canada, one in Mexico — amid growing tariff costs and supply chain disruptions. Then, on October 14, the company announced a stunning $13 billion investment to expand U.S. manufacturing, marking the largest single commitment in its history.

The move includes plans to expand facilities in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio, and to repurpose underused plants for new hybrid and electric models. While Stellantis hasn’t directly tied its decision to tariffs, the timing is telling.

Industry analysts note that tariff exposure on cross-border parts and vehicles likely played a major role. The company’s North American production mix has historically relied heavily on Canadian and Mexican plants for lower labor costs — but tariffs have narrowed that advantage.

“When the cost difference between building in Windsor and building in Toledo shrinks, you start to see companies doing the math,” said one senior industry economist. “Tariffs are effectively a relocation tax.”

The ripple effect across the industry

Stellantis isn’t alone. Ford, General Motors, and even foreign automakers with U.S. operations are reassessing how and where they build.

Some are accelerating plans to “nearshore” supply chains — moving critical component manufacturing from Asia to Mexico or the southern United States to limit tariff exposure. Others are exploring dual sourcing strategies, splitting production between domestic and foreign facilities to hedge risk.

According to AEG’s analysis, U.S. imports of completed vehicles from Mexico have declined slightly since the reciprocal tariffs were announced, while domestic output has edged upward.

That’s precisely the outcome trade hawks have been aiming for.

Still, not every automaker can easily adapt. Companies with smaller U.S. footprints or heavy reliance on imported components face tough decisions: absorb the cost, pass it on to consumers, or invest billions in new domestic infrastructure.

The real cost to consumers

Tariffs can be a political flashpoint, but for consumers, the effects are straightforward: higher prices — at least in the short term.

Automakers typically pass along a portion of tariff costs through modest price hikes. On a $40,000 vehicle, even a 2–3% increase in parts cost can add $800 to $1,200 to the final sticker price.

But tariffs also create jobs and stimulate domestic investment — benefits that ripple through the broader economy.

When Stellantis spends $13 billion expanding U.S. facilities, that means new construction contracts, local supplier growth, and thousands of jobs in manufacturing towns that have struggled since the last wave of plant closures.

It’s a short-term cost for a long-term gain, and one that many industry observers say could finally start reversing decades of offshoring.

A balancing act for automakers

Manufacturers are walking a fine line between staying competitive globally and complying with evolving trade rules at home.

For decades, North American production was built around the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) framework, which replaced NAFTA. The agreement allows tariff-free trade between the three countries, but only if vehicles meet strict “rules of origin” — requiring that a high percentage of parts come from North America.

Recent tariff expansions complicate that picture. Even when cars meet USMCA thresholds, they may still face additional duties under reciprocal tariffs or on specific raw materials like steel and aluminum.

For automakers, that’s like playing 3D chess: navigating overlapping trade rules, currency swings, and political shifts while keeping costs under control.

The bigger picture: Auto parts under pressure

While the major automakers have enough resources to adjust, smaller auto parts suppliers are in a far more precarious position.

The same week Anderson’s report was released, analysts warned that auto parts bankruptcies are surging across the U.S. — a troubling trend for the high-yield credit market.

Many of these suppliers operate on razor-thin margins. When tariffs raise input costs by even a few percentage points, those increases can push small companies into insolvency.

That, in turn, affects the entire supply chain. As suppliers close or consolidate, automakers face higher component prices and longer lead times. And for consumers, that can mean fewer affordable models and longer wait times for vehicle repairs.

Are tariffs working?

The effectiveness of tariffs often depends on your perspective.

Economists who favor free trade argue that tariffs distort markets and can backfire by increasing consumer prices or triggering retaliatory duties from trading partners.

Supporters, however, point to early signs of manufacturing reshoring, new capital investment, and stronger domestic job growth in industrial states.

From that standpoint, tariffs are doing exactly what they’re designed to do — making it more attractive to build in the United States and less profitable to rely on foreign factories.

“We’ve heard for years that automakers can’t afford to build here,” said one policy analyst familiar with the Anderson report. “Now, we’re seeing that they can — and that they’re starting to do it.”

Lessons from the past

The U.S. has used tariffs as a strategic tool before — sometimes successfully, sometimes not. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration imposed voluntary export restraints on Japanese automakers to protect domestic manufacturers.

At first, the move was controversial. But within a decade, many Japanese brands had built U.S. factories to avoid quotas — creating tens of thousands of American jobs in states like Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama.

Tariffs and trade pressure, in other words, don’t have to end globalization; they can redirect it. Instead of importing cars, companies start building them where the consumers are.

The future of American auto manufacturing

If the current trend continues, America’s auto industry could look very different by the end of the decade.

Instead of relying heavily on Canada and Mexico for assembly, companies may shift more final production to U.S. soil — particularly for higher-margin models like trucks, SUVs, and premium vehicles.

Electric vehicles, too, could see more U.S.-based manufacturing, as automakers race to qualify for domestic-production incentives under federal and state programs.

This shift could help rebuild the American industrial base — but it will also test whether the U.S. can compete on cost, logistics, and labor flexibility against long-established global supply chains.

The next big question is sustainability — not environmental, but economic.

If tariffs continue at this scale, automakers will need to offset costs through automation, localized supply chains, or price increases. For now, the industry seems to be absorbing the shock without major layoffs or price spikes, but that could change if trade tensions escalate or if other nations impose retaliatory duties.

And with major elections on the horizon, tariff policy will likely remain front and center. Both policymakers and manufacturers know that the future of the U.S. auto industry — and millions of jobs tied to it — hangs in the balance.

The new era of tariffs isn’t just a story about taxes or trade statistics. It’s about how America defines economic independence.

For decades, automakers built their strategies around global efficiency. Today, they’re being pushed — by policy, economics, and public sentiment — to prioritize domestic resilience.

That may mean slightly higher prices at the dealership today, but it also means more factories, more jobs, and more control over the country’s industrial destiny tomorrow.

The $10 billion price tag may seem steep. But for an industry that helped define America’s middle class, it might just be the cost of taking the driver’s seat again.

Destry Jarvis, Josh Jackson",,,,,https://www.hcn.org/articles/fix-our-forests-act-divides-environmental-community/,"The Fix Our Forests Act, sponsored by U.S. Sens.
The Forest Service currently treats about 4 million acres each year, a drop in the bucket of the nation’s 193 million acres of forest.
Medema and Miller-McFeeley said both of these provisions will give the Forest Service permission to start massive projects with little public oversight.
It also says that neither the Forest Service nor the Bureau of Land Management would be required to always work with the U.S.
“You tie those together, and it’s an existential threat to our forests and communities that survive because of them,” said Miller-McFeeley.","A new bill poised to pass the Senate after clearing the House will govern how the federal government thins, burns and otherwise manages nearly 200 million acres of the nation’s forests.

The Fix Our Forests Act, sponsored by U.S. Sens. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., John Curtis, R-Utah, Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., and Alex Padilla, D-Calif., passed out of Senate committee recently in a rare show of bipartisan support, with 18 senators in favor and only five opposed.

“There is a wildfire crisis across much of the country — our communities need action now,” said Hickenlooper in a news release. “Wildfires won’t wait.”

The proposed legislation — the first major congressional effort to fight wildfires in recent history — includes provisions that promote prescribed burning and forest thinning in fire-prone areas along with working with communities to create defensible space around vulnerable homes. The bill formally recognizes wetlands as buffers against wildfires and encourages cross-boundary programs among counties, states and tribes. It also reauthorizes the 2009 Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, which provides money for groups working together on fire mitigation and forest health, said Michael O’Casey, public-lands director for the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership.

“When you’re out hunting and in the woods in Western forests, you can see a lot of woods aren’t in good shape,” he said. “They’re too thick and ready for fire, frankly.”

Over a century of fire suppression has left the forests in a weakened state, he added, creating problems that drought, climate change and disease have only intensified. O’Casey hopes the bill can help prevent the megafires that have increasingly scorched the West.

The Forest Service currently treats about 4 million acres each year, a drop in the bucket of the nation’s 193 million acres of forest. Forest managers need to get to work now in the places “where it’s needed most,” O’Casey said. “I have hope it will facilitate more management on forest lands to keep the health of ecosystems in mind.”

But the bill also comes with provisions that some say will streamline projects while others say it will fracture the nation’s bedrock environmental laws. Right now, for example, the Forest Service is permitted to log, burn or otherwise alter sections of forest only after a period of public comment or by following the National Environmental Policy Act process, unless the proposed project is relatively small and would not “have a significant effect on the human environment.” This kind of exemption has been permitted as an emergency declaration of sorts that generally only applies to projects up to 2,000 or 3,000 acres in size, said the Sierra Club’s Anna Medema. But the new bill would increase that threshold to 10,000 acres.

Another controversial provision would allow the Forest Service to log and change landscapes across a “fireshed management area” without first consulting with tribes and the public or following the environmental review process. A fireshed can be up to 250,000 acres in size, which is as large as many Western national forest ranger districts, said Blaine Miller-McFeeley, a legislative representative with Earth Justice.

Medema and Miller-McFeeley said both of these provisions will give the Forest Service permission to start massive projects with little public oversight. But O’Casey argued that they will enable the agency to act quickly to tackle projects that may have previously been mired in red tape.

Similarly, the bill limits judicial review by changing the current statute of limitations for lawsuits from six years to a mere 150 days. It also says that neither the Forest Service nor the Bureau of Land Management would be required to always work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to update forest plans to reflect newly listed endangered species or new information about currently listed species.

Other critics point out that the legislation appropriates no new funding for thinning forests or creating defensible space around houses threatened by fire. And the Forest Service is already drastically underfunded and understaffed; the Department of Agriculture has fired thousands of employees, said Susan Jane Brown, an Oregon-based staff attorney for Silvix Resources, a nonprofit environmental law firm.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s Big Beautiful Bill mandated that the Forest Service meet annual timber quotas, meaning the agency’s remaining staffers will likely be directed to approve logging projects, Miller-McFeeley cautioned.

“You tie those together, and it’s an existential threat to our forests and communities that survive because of them,” said Miller-McFeeley.

O’Casey understands the critics’ concerns. Any bipartisan bill requires compromise, he acknowledged. But he insists that the bill is not a congressionally authorized logging free-for-all. Plenty of Western forests have thick stands of timber of low commercial value, such as ponderosa and juniper, he said, and the forests need to be thinned. O’Casey believes the bill will encourage that work using the best available science. In the long term, he sees it as a net positive for old-growth forests, water supplies and fire-prone communities.

However, since the bill doesn’t come with appropriated new funds, he noted that cities, counties, tribal nations, states and nonprofits will have to continue to lobby to pay for projects like wetland restoration and community fire resiliency.

“There are a lot of people who are really afraid of the bill for what it could do rather than excited about what it could do,” he said.

“Government shutdowns impose real, escalating costs. While exact figures vary, public estimates of the current funding lapse suggest $10 billion–$15 billion per week in lost output and economic activity. The longer the shutdown persists, the larger and more durable the economic damage becomes — and some of it could never be recovered.

“Among many other impacts, each day the government remains closed increases the permitting backlog for major infrastructure projects. The nation’s air traffic control system and its workforce are also showing signs of stress.

“We urge Congress to swiftly pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the federal government. Immediately reopening the government would avert further economic disruption and give Congress and the Administration time to negotiate a longer-term funding package and address other pressing issues.”

The call comes as the Chamber released a new analysis and interactive map showing 65,500 small business contractors in the United States have nearly $3 billion a week at risk because of the shutdown, with $12 billion just in the month of October alone.

For weeks, the Chamber has stressed the negative impact of the government shutdown and called for the administration and Congress to work together to reopen the government. On October 2, the Chamber sent a memo to its members outlining the implications of a government shutdown and the outlook for reopening the government. The Chamber also sent a letter to the Senate urging passage of the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026.

Earlier this month, the Chamber hosted dozens of small businesses for a Capitol Hill fly-in. Businesses met with lawmakers and their staffs to share their priorities. The Chamber also published new stories from small businesses nationwide who are feeling the shutdown’s effects firsthand:

Signers of the letter include Airlines for America, American Hotel & Lodging Association, Associated General Contractors of America Association of Equipment Manufacturers, Business Roundtable, National Association of Manufacturers, National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, National Electrical Manufacturers Association, National Retail Federation, National Association of Home Builders, and U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Batteries have quickly become a crucial part of the U.S. electricity grid — and a whole lot more are about to come online.

Over the next five years, the country will build nearly 67 gigawatts’ worth of new utility-scale batteries, per data from research firm BloombergNEF, enough to send almost 284 gigawatt-hours of stored-up electricity back to the grid.

Those are massive figures. Should the forecast bear out, the U.S. will have roughly three times more battery capacity in 2030 than it does now. Such rapid growth is familiar territory for the sector, which jumped from just 1.5 GW of total capacity in 2020 to a whopping 27.3 GW by the end of last year.

The transition to renewable energy — particularly solar — relies on batteries. That’s because communities with lots of solar arrays often generate more power than the grid needs at a particular moment in time. Batteries let these solar-saturated states save that extra energy for later use.

California and Texas, the U.S.’s two leaders on solar, have built the vast majority of the country’s utility-scale storage. Already, the states are reaping the benefits. By spring of 2024, California’s battery fleet had grown large enough to begin displacing some natural-gas use in the evening. Meanwhile, batteries have helped Texas stave off summertime grid emergencies for two years running.

As battery developers propose more, bigger projects, the sector has started to run into some opposition. Just last week, news broke that plans to build New York’s biggest battery on Staten Island fell through following fervent protest from the local community. Fears of battery fires have spread around the country following the massive blaze at California’s Moss Landing facility in January, even though that disaster stemmed from the project’s outdated design.

Still, several broader trends suggest the sector’s growth will continue.

For one, President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act left incentives for battery storage relatively untouched, even as it yanked away tax credits for solar and wind projects. Then there’s the fact that solar is growing steadily around the country, which will eventually create a need for storage in other states just as it has in California and Texas. Most important of all, demand for electricity is surging nationwide — and batteries are among the cheapest and quickest ways to get more capacity onto the grid.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/COTW-battery-boom-1.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=6590816efb583b2b370da1c7b8800587,N,,2025-10-31 05:04:51.216083

In Georgia, they're on the ballot. - Canary Media",Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/georgia-regulator-psc-elections-energy-affordability,"That’s particularly true for the 2.8 million customers of the state’s major utility, Georgia Power, for whom costs have ballooned in recent years.
“Utility bills in Georgia are literally on the ballot,” said Charles Hua, executive director of consumer-education nonprofit PowerLines, during an October webinar.
The race comes as Georgia Power faces fervent criticism over its plan to spend billions of dollars building new natural-gas power plants.
“We’re always reacting to what Georgia Power is putting in front of us,” he said.
Georgia Power has pointed to challenges in expanding its power grid to allow these projects to interconnect.","The race for two seats on the obscure board that regulates Georgia’s utilities is drawing national attention — and could have major implications both for electricity affordability and one of the biggest planned fossil-fuel buildouts in the nation.

Next Tuesday, Georgia voters will choose whether to keep the state’s five-person Public Service Commission as it is, or elevate two outsiders to shake up the status quo.

Historically, PSC races have drawn a very small number of voters, but turnout in Georgia may be higher than usual this year. For one, legal issues have postponed the state’s PSC elections since 2022. The bigger driver, however, could be an issue that is rising in political salience around the country: Electricity is getting way too expensive. That’s particularly true for the 2.8 million customers of the state’s major utility, Georgia Power, for whom costs have ballooned in recent years.

“Utility bills in Georgia are literally on the ballot,” said Charles Hua, executive director of consumer-education nonprofit PowerLines, during an October webinar.

The race comes as Georgia Power faces fervent criticism over its plan to spend billions of dollars building new natural-gas power plants. Energy experts, consumer advocates, and climate activists have pressed the utility to instead prioritize solar and battery storage, which they argue is not only better for the planet but for consumers’ wallets, too.

It’s a criticism that has been echoed by both of the Democratic challengers up for election next week. Of particular note, however, is the pushback from the candidate Peter Hubbard, a 13-year energy-industry veteran with expertise in complex grid and power-resource modeling. Hubbard has personally run the numbers to back up the claims from himself and others that Georgia Power can meet its growing energy needs with clean energy, rather than gas.

If elected, Hubbard, who runs the one-person policy modeling shop Georgia Center for Energy Solutions, said he’d push Georgia Power to consider these cleaner, cheaper options — and press the commission to be more proactive in shaping the utility’s plans.

“We’re always reacting to what Georgia Power is putting in front of us,” he said. But there’s no reason why commissioners can’t drive the agenda and ​“put something in front of them” instead.

Alicia Johnson, who is running as a Democrat for the other PSC seat, has also called for more clean energy and more active oversight from the PSC to combat rising costs, particularly for disadvantaged households. Johnson is a healthcare-focused consultant and community advocate and is challenging Commissioner Tim Echols, a Republican who was first elected in 2010.

Hubbard is up against Fitz Johnson, a U.S. Army veteran and businessman who was appointed to his seat in 2021 by Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican. Kemp has thrown his financial and political support behind Johnson and Echols.

“My opponent wants to take away your coal. He wants to take away your natural gas,” Fitz Johnson said during an October campaign event covered by the Macon Telegraph newspaper. ​“He wants to bring in this Green New Deal energy policy that they have in California. And I already told them, don’t California my Georgia.”

Fitz Johnson has promoted ​‘round-the-clock power from large-scale plants as the key to Georgia’s economic prosperity; in a recent Facebook post, he framed voters’ choice as one between ​“affordable, reliable energy vs. costly climate mandates and rolling blackouts.” Fitz Johnson did not respond to Canary Media’s requests for comment.

Taking on the utility — and the rest of the PSC

For the average household served by Georgia Power, monthly electricity bills are now a whopping $43 more than they were two years ago, according to data from the Southern Environmental Law Center.

There are several reasons for this rise, but the big two are massive cost overruns for construction of the utility’s nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which caused a spike in the price of gas that Georgia Power passed on to its consumers.

The current PSC signed off on both of those rate hikes. Now, Hubbard and a growing chorus of energy experts, climate activists, and consumer advocates are worried that will happen again with Georgia Power’s push to expand its gas fleet.

In July, the utility presented a new plan to the commission calling for the addition of 10 gigawatts of capacity by 2031 to its current portfolio of 14.7 gigawatts. About 60% of the infrastructure the company hopes to construct would be gas-fired power, while the remainder would be batteries. Georgia Power’s justification for the massive buildout is a projected surge in electricity demand — an expectation based almost entirely on forecast growth in data-center construction.

Rick Anderson, senior vice president and senior production officer for Georgia Power, said in a statement that the plan will ​“help us meet the needs of a growing Georgia with reliable and resilient energy while delivering long-term value for all of our customers.”

But Hubbard and others say the utility might be significantly underestimating the price tag of building and fueling new gas-fired plants.

Though Georgia Power says the buildout would cost $15.7 billion, Hubbard said the true total may reach ​“north of $20 billion,” once taxes and potential cost overruns that could be added in under construction-work-in-progress provisions are bundled in.

Hubbard is also concerned that the data centers underpinning Georgia Power’s expansion plan may fail to materialize. If the AI bubble bursts and those facilities are never built, or if developers simply choose to build in another state, customers would be stuck with even higher utility bills to pay for assets they don’t need.

A Georgia Power spokesperson told Canary Media that the utility has options to contain cost impacts on its customers if its power-demand forecasts turn out to be too high; for example, it could delay or cancel construction or sell capacity on the wholesale market.

“Nothing about the Company’s current request binds the Commission’s hands on taking actions to re-examine a certificate if forecasted needs were to change,” the spokesperson said in a September email.

But Hubbard worries that these kinds of remedial actions won’t be effective. Once the utility starts ordering power turbines, expanding gas-pipeline capacity, and taking on other construction costs, ​“you can’t unring the bell,” he said. ​“The best way to prevent that is to not make the mistake in the first place.”

To be clear, it’s not certain that Hubbard or his fellow Democratic challenger in next week’s election will have the power to make major changes at the commission. If she and Hubbard win seats on the commission, they’d have to convince at least one of the three Republicans to side with them in any decision.

Hubbard conceded that his pro-environmental stances have put him at odds with current commissioners. He’s on the record opposing the commission’s decisions this year on Georgia Power’s integrated resource plan and on a temporary rate freeze that critics say obscures the looming costs that customers may end up paying for the utility’s fossil-fuel-heavy resource mix. Hubbard has also blasted the regulatory group for being too in step with the utility.

“Frankly, the five Republican commissioners on the commission take their cues from Georgia Power,” he said.

He’s not alone in that viewpoint. Robert Baker, a Republican PSC commissioner from 1993 to 2011, told Canary Media in September that he thinks the current commission has failed to sufficiently push back on the utility’s plans.

“You’re dealing with a commission that basically rubber-stamps everything that comes its way from Georgia Power,” he said. ​“That makes it very difficult for people who have a differing opinion about what should happen, or how it should happen, to have serious input into the process.”

Even if it is an uphill battle, Hubbard said that if elected, he’d at least have the ​“bully pulpit” to raise visibility for his concerns — and push for better regulation.

The case for solar and batteries in Georgia

Right now, big solar farms are the cheapest, fastest way to add new electrons to the grid — and Georgia is one of the top states for growth of the renewable energy resource.

Meanwhile, gas turbines are in very short supply, with current estimates of backlogs for new gas-power plants stretching into the early 2030s.

That’s why Georgia Power’s proposal to focus on building out fossil-fueled infrastructure defies logic, Hubbard said.

Georgia Power has put a ​“thumb on the scale” against solar over the past half-decade or so, Hubbard said. The reason, he believes, is that the PSC has mandated that most of the utility’s solar expansion be built by third-party developers rather than Georgia Power itself. But these third-party resources are less lucrative to vertically integrated utilities like Georgia Power, which earn a guaranteed profit on the projects they build and operate.

In recent years, the utility has delayed and rejected solar procurements under competitive structures. Nearly 18 gigawatts of solar and battery projects from outside developers are now seeking to interconnect in Georgia, as Hubbard noted in May testimony to the commission — a pool of resources that could be brought online to meet the load growth the utility is facing.

Georgia Power has pointed to challenges in expanding its power grid to allow these projects to interconnect. Similar grid bottlenecks are holding back new solar, wind, and battery projects across the country.

But Hubbard said the commission could push the utility to find less congested parts of its grid where solar and battery projects could be fast-tracked. In fact, he’s familiar with the Georgia Power maps that can reveal such ​“sweet spots,” due to his work as a grid expert for solar developers in the state.

“This could tell you whether developing a solar and battery plant here could bear far higher costs than developing it at this other location,” he said. ​“What often kills a project are the interconnection costs — and those aren’t known until you go through the whole interconnection study process.”

But as a commissioner, he’d be able to access the underlying data to determine the exact mix of clean power versus fossil gas that would be most cost-effective.

“I’m going to tread carefully on all this,” he said. ​“Once I have access to all that information, I’m not sure what I’ll find. … But I want to do it.”

Your Excellencies and distinguished guests: Good afternoon. It is an honor to be here representing Citigroup, and to thank our hosts in Gyeongju for bringing us together.

For Citi, the location for this year’s APEC meetings carries special meaning. We opened our first branch in Seoul in early 1967, making Citi the first foreign bank in Korea. Since then, we’ve stood with our clients here through every transformation in the regional and global economy. And whilst it’s a privilege to speak in Korea, today’s story is far bigger than any one country.

At Citi, we see the APEC economies as an interconnected engine of global progress — spanning Asia, the Americas and the Pacific. What happens here doesn’t stay here; it shapes how the world grows, trades and connects.

Globalization isn’t vanishing; it’s changing. Growth is becoming more balanced, more digital and more distributed. The APEC economies sit at the center of that change — together accounting for 61% of global GDP and over half of global trade.

Since I last addressed APEC in 2023, we’ve seen a shift from reaction to reinvention. Back then, clients were reacting to shocks. Now, they’re investing for the long term — redesigning supply chains, digitizing operations and embedding resilience.

Three themes define how this rewiring is taking shape. First, resilience — the ability to adjust and keep moving through uncertainty. Second, innovation — new technologies and energy systems reshaping how we live and work. And third, broad-based growth — ensuring the benefits of progress reach more people, more sectors and more places.

Together, these three forces are turning APEC into a unified driver of global progress.

Let’s begin with resilience. Across APEC, resilience means more than endurance. It’s the capacity to flex, adapt and grow through disruption.

We see it in Citi’s transaction data: trade volumes and payments moving steadily across a more diverse mix of routes. Supply chains becoming multi-hub networks instead of single corridors.

This is resilience in action — from advanced manufacturing in the U.S. and Mexico to energy and logistics in Canada to semiconductors in Korea and electronics in Malaysia.

U.S.-Asia trade remains one of the fastest growing corridors for our clients. And across those flows, we’re helping them find efficiencies so tariff and transport costs don’t reach consumers.

That same spirit of adaptability is shaping the rest of the region. Korea’s evolution from agriculture to advanced technology tells that story — with Samsung, LG, Hyundai and SK now operating in more than 70 markets. So does Vietnam’s emergence as a manufacturing powerhouse. And Indonesia’s rise in energy and minerals. And Australia’s role in critical raw materials.

Across the APEC economies, resilience has become a shared advantage. And we’ve seen that resilience take shape in real time. Recent bilateral agreements between the U.S. and China, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia are practical steps toward strengthening trade stability and regional connectivity. They’re reminders that cooperation remains the foundation of resilience, even when competition is part of the equation.

If resilience is the foundation, then innovation is the engine.

The next industrial era is taking shape across the APEC economies — powered by technology, clean energy and digital connectivity.

Since 2020, more than $200 billion in private capital has flowed into frontier technologies across APEC. Generative AI alone accounts for over half of that, whilst investments in robotics and decentralized finance are accelerating rapidly. The U.S. remains the world’s largest investor in AI — about $109 billion last year — while economies throughout Asia are driving application and scale.

Together, APEC economies are forming a dynamic innovation loop: pairing North American R&D and venture capital with Asia’s manufacturing depth and speed. That partnership is delivering breakthroughs that benefit the world.

Clean-energy investment tells a similar story. Energy-transition spending across APEC now averages two percent to three percent of GDP annually. Central to this effort is China, the leader in EV and battery exports. Korea and the U.S. are expanding next-generation semiconductors and energy storage. And Japan and Australia are advancing hydrogen and carbon-capture.

In Thailand, we see this transition vividly: new EV supply chains are emerging alongside traditional ones. Chinese EV manufacturers are building in parallel with Japanese firms long anchored in internal-combustion engines.

Digital infrastructure is the connective tissue. Data centers are rising in Singapore and Malaysia. Fintech platforms are scaling in the Philippines, Chile and Mexico. And Citi’s own digital networks are ensuring that capital moves as efficiently as ideas.

In many ways, APEC is where the future is being built — one network, one innovation, one connection at a time.

Finally, broad-based growth. For globalization to endure, growth must be widely shared.

Asia’s rising middle class will represent two-thirds of global consumers by 2030. That will create new markets for U.S. exports and expand opportunity for emerging economies. Manufacturing excellence in the APEC economies is now being matched by the expanding services trade — in finance, technology, education, entertainment. Digital services alone have grown by more than three percentage points of exports since 2012.

This is where APEC can lead: pairing world-class innovation and capital with deep production capability and a youthful consumer base across Asia and the Pacific.

At Citi, we see that growth in real time. Half of our new trade-finance clients in Asia are small- and medium-sized enterprises. We’re helping women entrepreneurs access working capital. We’re financing sustainable infrastructure so smaller firms can compete globally. Because when more people and more places participate in the economy, opportunity expands and the foundations of growth become stronger.

Standing here in Gyeongju, it’s impossible not to feel the weight of history and speed of change. Centuries ago, artisans in the Silla Dynasty crafted treasures that defined an era. Today, engineers in this region — and across the Americas — are building technologies that will define the next.

The economies of APEC are not on parallel tracks. They’re interconnected engines of global progress. Each depends on the other — for markets, capital, innovation, stability.

At Citi, we’ve witnessed that interdependence for more than 120 years in this region. We came to Asia to help companies grow. Today we’re helping firms across the region expand globally. In recent months, APEC members have announced hundreds of billions in planned investments in the U.S. — a powerful signal of confidence in American enterprise and in the ties that bind this community together. Citi is proud to play a role in enabling that growth, linking capital with ideas, and ambition with opportunity.

Because in the end, the true direction of globalization isn’t east or west. It’s forward. And the future will belong to those who build it together.

Thank you.",https://www.citigroup.com/global/citigroup-ui/akpublic/images/gpa_favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-31 08:19:00.556743

Competitive Power Ventures will use the loan from the Texas Energy Fund to construct a 1,350-megawatt combined-cycle gas plant — among the more efficient types of fossil-fuel generation — in the Permian that’s expected to start up by 2029, CPV said Thursday in a statement. That’s enough to supply about 850,000 homes in West Texas, an emerging hub for data centers to run artificial intelligence.

While the $1.9 billion project has been in development for years, “I’m not sure we would have started construction without this loan,” CPV Chief Executive Officer Sherman Knight said in an interview. Because power demand had flatlined until the last couple of years, “we don’t have the muscle memory to meet load growth in many of the markets and Texas is the first. The load growth started there.”

CPV plans to tap gas supplies from Coterra Energy Inc., Devon Energy Corp. and Diamondback Energy Inc. Multiple sources of gas will enable the power plant “to maintain consistent performance during extreme weather and other critical events,” CPV said in statement. The company also said the facility will use turbines from GE Vernova Inc. The project is also fully permitted for carbon capture, which could be added in future phases, Knight said.

Texas launched the fund to build so-called dispatchable generation — plants that can easily be turned on or off — after cascading power and gas failures during an intense winter storm in 2021 left millions of people in the dark for days and killed more than 200. The legislature appropriated $5 billion for the fund for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, with an additional $4 billion added for the following two years.

The fund is targeting the construction of about 10 gigawatts of gas plants. Those projects are intended to help keep the lights on amid the rise of renewables, which provide power intermittently, and booming electricity demand from data centers. Supply-chain bottlenecks and soaring costs had forced some projects to pull out of the Texas program.

CPV is considering building other power plants in Texas as AI accelerates strong growth in electricity demand already coming from industrial users, Knight said. He declined to say whether the developer would apply for additional loans.

“I don’t know how somebody could start honestly from scratch in this type of environment and build the relationship and the coalition needed,” said Knight.

AUSTIN – Governor Greg Abbott announced the fifth Texas Energy Fund (TxEF) loan agreement for a 1,350 megawatt (MW) natural gas power plant in Ward County. Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) Basin Ranch will build the plant, which is expected to begin generating power for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power region in 2029.

“The Texas Energy Fund secured the largest capacity project to date, with 1,350 MW of new, reliable power generation coming online that will further fortify our state grid and support our growing economy for decades,” said Governor Abbott. “As one of the largest sources of dispatchable power generation for the grid, this investment is just the latest example of why Texas is the energy capital of the world. We will take every step necessary to ensure affordability and electric reliability for Texas homes and businesses across our great state.”

“The Texas Energy Fund has now financed the addition of over 3,100 MW of new, reliable power for the State of Texas,” said Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) Chairman Thomas Gleeson. “There is important work still ahead, but this newest commitment to invest in Texas is a clear demonstration of the value and reliability benefits the TxEF is bringing to bear.”

“We thank Governor Greg Abbott, his administration, the Texas Legislature, the PUC, and Ward County for their continued support of the CPV Basin Ranch Energy Center that will provide critical baseload power to the citizens of Texas,” said Competitive Power Ventures CEO Sherman Knight. “Through incentives and available natural resources, Texas is paving the way for new investments and development across the state; CPV looks forward to playing a role in that future.”

At 1,350 MW, the facility has the largest capacity of any project financed by the TxEF to date. Once connected, the CPV project will become one of the largest sources of dispatchable generation capacity for the ERCOT grid.

The loan agreement between the PUC and CPV is the fifth under the TxEF’s In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program, which provides low-interest loans for projects that add new, dispatchable power to the ERCOT region. Under the loan agreement, total project costs are estimated to be $1.88 billion. The PUC is providing a 20-year TxEF loan of $1.12 billion, or 60% of the total project cost, at a 3% interest rate. The loan term runs from Oct. 28, 2025, through Oct. 28, 2045.

The natural gas generation facility will be built at CPV’s Basin Ranch Energy Center in Ward County. The project will interconnect in the ERCOT West Load Zone.

Under the loan agreement, the facility must meet minimum performance standards, as outlined in the In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program rules.

The TxEF is administered by the PUC through a competitive application process and rigorous financial review of proposed projects.

There are 12 TxEF In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program applications moving through a due diligence review process.

Duke Energy Indiana estimated the approach would save customers $812 million over the project’s life — predicting a total of $5.3 billion instead of the $6.6 billion expected under a traditional general rate case scenario.
Duke Energy can afford to pay for this, ratepayers cannot,” Executive Director Kerwin Olson said in a statement.
“It is Duke Energy and their investors who stand to realize enormous profits from this project,” he continued.
The coal units are scheduled to retire in 2029 and 2030.","Indiana regulators on Wednesday approved Duke Energy Indiana’s $3.3 billion plan — plus financing costs — to replace two coal-powered units at the west-central Cayuga Generating Station with natural gas versions.

Included was a settlement agreement with coal producers to study third-party operation of the retired coal units.

“For generations, our Cayuga power plant in Vermillion County has served the state, and today’s decision ensures it will continue to be a major source of our state’s power generation for decades to come,” a Duke Energy Indiana statement reads, in part.

After more than 55 years in operation, Cayuga is the oldest coal-fired facility left in Duke’s Hoosier portfolio.

After the replacement, the two combined-cycle natural gas units would add more than 470 megawatts to the aging facility’s current 1005-megawatt capacity.

The undertaking was approved as a “clean energy” project with financial incentives, including the authority to charge ratepayers for financing while the units are under construction.

Duke Energy Indiana estimated the approach would save customers $812 million over the project’s life — predicting a total of $5.3 billion instead of the $6.6 billion expected under a traditional general rate case scenario.

The rate impact will hit in six-month increments, helping “reduce any rate shock that could be otherwise associated with implementing a construction project in base rates through a single step,” the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s Wednesday order reads.

The state agency tasked with protecting utility customers previously asked regulators to reject the plan, calling it “ill-advised” in May. Office of Utility Consumer Counselor witnesses cited the sheer cost, rapidly changing regulations and technological advancements in their testimony.

Duke has estimated that the first tracker filed would add $1.87 to the typical residential customer’s monthly bill. But that amount would rise as construction continues — with the OUCC predicting a total impact of $19.37 monthly.

Asked for a response to the approval, agency spokeswoman Olivia Rodrigo wrote, “After the IURC issues an order, the OUCC begins extensive legal and technical review. This order is 80 pages, and our staff has begun the review process, which will take time. I can not offer additional information or comment at this time as I must allow time for staff to conduct their review.”

But another intervenor in the case, utility advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition, condemned the commission’s decision.

“Forcing struggling Hoosier ratepayers to shoulder the burden of the costs and risks associated with the construction and financing of this extraordinarily expensive project is simply unfair and immoral. Duke Energy can afford to pay for this, ratepayers cannot,” Executive Director Kerwin Olson said in a statement.

“It is Duke Energy and their investors who stand to realize enormous profits from this project,” he continued. “Profit is supposed to be a reward for risk, but the IURC order shifts the risk to ratepayers. That’s not right. Hoosier ratepayers can no longer afford to be used as cash cows for these out of state energy holding companies. It’s exceptionally unfortunate that the State of Indiana is continuing to allow this to happen.”

Olson also called the approval a “loss” for the environment, adding, “Doubling down on fossil fuels will not only increase our State’s massive contribution to climate change, but will do nothing to improve the quality of the air we breathe and the water we drink. There’s a better, cheaper, and cleaner alternative path forward that will improve outcomes for all Hoosiers. This order is taking us in the wrong direction.”

Coal unit settlement

Duke Energy Indiana’s regulatory win comes with a settlement with Reliable Energy, a trade association representing major Indiana coal producers, for a study that could result in third-party operation of the coal units at Cayuga. The group previously opposed the coal-to-gas plan.

Reliable Energy President Savannah Kerstiens said the agreement “represents a significant step toward Governor (Mike) Braun’s vision of ensuring reliable, affordable energy, preserving valuable in-state generation, and strengthening Indiana’s power supply.”

“As power demand continues to rise, a central goal of this vision is to position Indiana as an energy exporter rather than an importer — a milestone that can be achieved by keeping every megawatt of capacity online,” she continued. “Enabling third parties to help advance that effort demonstrates the innovative, entrepreneurial approach that defines Indiana’s energy strategy.”

The proceeds from any sale would flow to the utility’s ratepayers.

Duke Energy Indiana also invoked Braun’s name, saying the settlement “aligns” with recent executive orders “encouraging additions to the state’s power supplies and making sure there’s careful evaluation before retiring coal units.”

The utility will look at the technical feasibility of simultaneously operating the coal and natural gas units, including the potential for “full(y) decoupling” the units.

The study was set to begin as soon as regulators approved the coal-to-gas replacement and has to be done in eight months, at most, according to the settlement agreement.

The filing lays out a detailed list of what must be studied, plus a timeline for Duke Energy Indiana to follow on stakeholder engagement, a request for proposals and bidding process, a due diligence and a negotiations period.

The coal units are scheduled to retire in 2029 and 2030. The utility agreed not to shut them down before 2029 — and to pause demolition during the request for proposals process, until regulators say demolition can continue.",http://indianaeconomicdigest.net/Images/Images/163963.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 11:28:12.492779

EPBC Act means the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth).","Executive summary

Australia’s long-awaited overhaul of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act) took a major step forward yesterday, with the introduction of a package of reform bills to Parliament.

The Australian Government tabled the Environment Protection Reform Bill 2025 (Cth), along with a suite of additional bills (collectively, the EPBC Act Reforms), representing the most ambitious reform of federal environmental law in a quarter of a century.

The key features of the reforms fall under the following themes:

National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA): establishes an independent regulator with the power to enforce compliance, require audits and issue environmental protection orders. It is likely that NEPA will assess and approve proposals under delegation, with the Minister for the Environment and Water (Minister) retaining final approval powers.

National Environmental Standards (Standards): introduces legally binding, measurable Standards for matters of national environmental significance (MNES), regional planning, restoration actions and contributions, community engagement and consultation, and First Nations engagement.

Streamlined environmental impact assessment: introduces a new streamlined assessment process to replace three of the current pathways. Actions with ‘unacceptable impacts’ on protected matters will not be approved. The Minister will have the power to approve ‘national interest proposals’ (such as social housing and renewable energy projects) which do not have to strictly comply with the Standards, may have unacceptable impacts and may not be required to deliver a net gain for nature. The Bill also retains and expands the national interest exemption.

Offsets and restoration contributions: completely revamps the offset framework. Proponents will have to deliver a ‘net gain’ for nature via traditional land-based offsets or payments to a new Restoration Contributions Special Account, which will be managed by an independent Restoration Contributions Holder for restoration actions.

Regional (bioregional) planning: introduces bioregional plans to map areas for development and protection, and seeks to streamline approvals for compliant projects. Certain restricted actions will be prohibited in high-value areas (called ‘conservation zones’). Priority actions will be permitted without assessment and approval in ‘development zones’ and offset delivery will be coordinated. Pilots are already underway in some states.

Environment Information Australia (EIA): establishes the EIA as an independent body responsible for producing State of the Environment reports every two years. It will also provide the Minister, NEPA, and the public with access to high quality environmental information and data, while maintaining environmental economic accounts and a public register of national environmental information assets.

Working with First Nations partners: embeds First Nations involvement in assessment and planning processes, and in the development of Standards and bioregional plans. Additional details will follow in regulations and policy.

Despite extensive debate, there is no new ‘climate trigger’. Proponents will be required to disclose emissions and mitigation measures, but greenhouse gas considerations are simply informational.

The EPBC Act Reforms seek to reduce duplication and increase certainty for proponents. Proponents that adapt early - by designing projects in accordance with the Standards, engaging with First Nations partners from the outset, and planning for direct offsets or restoration contributions - are likely to navigate this transition more effectively. Transitional provisions will apply to projects already subject to assessment, so understanding how they operate will be critical.

What’s driving the reform

The case for environmental law reform is not new. The Samuel Review concluded that the existing federal framework is not fit for purpose. It was criticised as being too complex, slow, and ineffective in protecting biodiversity. The Government’s ‘Nature Positive Plan’, released in December 2022, responded to these findings by committing to a suite of reforms.

The current reform package represents a second attempt to legislate these commitments after earlier proposals stalled in 2024.

You can find more details about the background of these reforms in our previous article here.

Currently, the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee is expected to report back on its inquiry by 24 March 2026, with submissions closing on 5 December 2025.

Deep-dive analysis of the key elements of the reforms

National Environmental Protection Agency

The NEPA Bill proposes to establish a new independent statutory entity, the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), with broad ranging powers and functions, including the power to:

Issue Environment Protection Orders (EPO), requiring (for example) work to cease;

Require a broader range of people to carry out a directed environmental audit; and

Require a new form of audit called a compliance audit.

Background

The Samuel Review included several recommendations related to the compliance and enforcement regime under the EPBC Act. While the Samuel Review did not recommend the establishment of the NEPA, it did recommend consolidating compliance and enforcement powers, and emphasised that the current regime is ineffective for several reasons:

Powers for enforcement and compliance are restrictive and outdated and can only be applied in a piecemeal fashion;

‘Serious enforcement action’ is rarely used;

Increased surveillance and monitoring of compliance with the EPBC Act is required; and

Penalties are not commensurate to the offences.

At a high level, the reforms respond to the recommendations in the Samuel Review.

NEPA’s functions and powers

NEPA will administer Australia’s national environmental laws that implement Australia’s international commitments and obligations, including the EPBC Act, and laws that regulate sea dumping, hazardous waste, ozone protection and synthetic greenhouse gas management, product emissions, recycling and waste reduction, and underwater cultural heritage.

It will have significant compliance and enforcement powers (more below).

What’s new?

The core function of NEPA will be to act as independent regulator with administration and enforcement powers and functions.

Under the current EPBC Act, the Minister has the power to apply to the Federal Court for an injunction or remediation order. However, often this does not provide the Minister with adequate powers to prevent imminent or serious damage to MNES.

The reforms will empower the CEO of NEPA to issue Environment Protection Orders which may require work to cease - either in writing or in urgent circumstances, verbally. This power may be exercised if there is a likely or actual contravention of the EPBC Act which poses an imminent risk of serious damage to the environment. Notably, the CEO is not required to observe any requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in issuing an Environment Protection Order.

As part of its compliance function, the CEO:

Will have powers to require a broader range of people to carry out a directed environmental audit, extending beyond the holder of an approval, to persons who are subject to an EPO, a conservation order, a remediation determination, or a remediation order; and

Can require a new form of audit called a compliance audit, to monitor compliance with matters such as approval conditions, EPO requirements or the scope of an exemption.

These audits must be carried out by an authorised officer (that is, a warden or inspector) or registered auditor. NEPA will establish a register of third party auditors for the purposes of the Act. Regulations will determine such matters as the form and content of the register, how it is published and the requirements auditors must meet in order to maintain registration.

The CEO will also have the power to:

Issue various permits including trading of, keeping or moving listed marine species of wildlife, (noting that the CEO must take the precautionary principle into account in making certain decisions;

Request information relating to the performance of the CEO’s functions from any person or body;

Disclose information to various Commonwealth entities, State or Territory bodies for the purposes of law enforcement, to assist the Head of Environment Information Australia or if the CEO reasonably believes the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious risk to the environment or human health;

Monitor and audit the operation of:

Declarations made by the Minister:

That a specified class of actions do not require approval because they are approved under an accredited management or authorisation framework;

Accrediting a management arrangement or authorisation (i.e. ensuring the Minister does not give preference to one State over another in accreditation);

Bilateral agreements; and

Bioregional plans

Make recommendations to the Minister to improve regulation.

Increase in penalties

The reforms significantly increase the maximum penalties that can be imposed under the EPBC Act. The reforms propose to introduce a new formula for determining penalties which take into account the benefit derived by the non-compliance and ensure that non-compliance is not perceived as merely the ‘cost of doing business’. While the penalty units for the offences remain consistent with current penalties, the ability to seek fines as a proportion of turnover could result in a penalty of up to $825,000,000.

We set out a comparison of the current maximum civil penalties that can be imposed under the EPBC Act and the maximum penalties under the EPBC Act reforms (including for breaching a condition of an approval issued under the EPBC Act and a range of other offences):

Current EPBC Act Proposed reforms Individual $1,650,000 The higher of:

5,000 penalty units; (i.e. $1,650,000) or

3 x the total value of any benefit obtained and/or detriment avoided as a result of the contravention (if the court can determine these amounts).

Body corporate $16,500,000 The higher of:

50,000 penalty units (i.e. $16,500,000);

3 x the total value of any benefit obtained and/or detriment avoided as a result of the contravention (if the court can determine these amounts); or

10% of the company’s annual turnover for the 12 months ending at the end of the month in which the contravention occurred (up to a maximum of 2.5 million penalty units (i.e. $825,000,000)).

National environmental standards

Consistent with a central recommendation in the Samuel Review, the Environment Protection Reform Bill 2025 (Cth) (the Bill) introduces a power for the Minister to make, vary and revoke National Environmental Standards (Standards) by legislative instrument.

The Standards are therefore not included in the Bill, but Minister Watt has indicated that draft Standards relating to at least offsets and MNES will be published imminently.

A Standard must prescribe outcomes or objectives, and may also prescribe parameters, principles, processes or actions for achieving the outcomes or objectives. The Minister has a broad discretion to make a Standard, subject to following a prescribed procedure (including public consultation), and being satisfied that the Standard promotes the objects of the EPBC Act and is not inconsistent with relevant international agreements. In revoking or varying a Standard, the Minister must comply with a ‘no regression’ principle by ensuring that environmental protections are not reduced.

The Bill provides for the mandatory use of the Standard in a number of decision-making processes, although regulations (which are not yet available) will prescribe which Standards are to be applied in each case. For example, the following actions by the Minister under the EPBC Act must not be inconsistent with a relevant Standard (to be prescribed by regulation):

A decision to approve the taking of an action;

A decision to revoke, vary or add to a condition of an approval;

A decision to extend an approval period;

A decision to enter into a bilateral agreement, or to accredit a State or Territory management or authorisation framework; and

A decision to make a bioregional plan or protection statement.

Additionally, the Bill will also give the Minister power to make rulings on how the law, regulations or subordinate instruments (including the Standards) should be applied in particular circumstances. The Minister, the CEO of NEPA and other delegated decision makers must act consistently with any such ruling. How, and how often, this power is intended to be used by the Minister is yet unknown.

The existing list of MNES has not been amended, with the new Standards mainly shaping how those existing matters are assessed and protected.

Even where a Standard is not required to be applied in making a decision under the EPBC Act, a decision maker can still choose to have regard to it in making a decision if they consider it to be relevant to the decision.

Transitional arrangements

The Minister’s power to make Standards will commence on the day after the Bill receives Royal Assent. The provisions that provide for the Standards to be applied in decision-making processes will commence on the earlier of a day (or days) fixed by Proclamation, or 12 months after the provisions receive Royal Assent.

The Standards will be relevant to all projects which trigger the need for assessment under the EPBC Act. As enabling legislation, the Bill leaves much of the detail to the subordinate regulations and the Standards themselves.

New streamlined assessment process and a focus on assessment and approval bilateral agreements

The Bill proposes several changes to the assessment framework for controlled actions, which are intended to streamline assessments and achieve a quicker turnaround on approvals.

Mechanisms to streamline the assessment framework include:

Repealing existing Division 3A (assessment on referral information), Division 4 (assessment on preliminary documentation) and Division 5 (assessment by public environment report) of Part 8 of the EPBC Act and replacing them with a new Division 5A, which would contain a new streamlined assessment pathway; and

Clarifying that if approval of the taking of an action is dealt with in another way (such as under a bilateral agreement or in a bioregional plan), the action cannot generally be referred for assessment.

One key change relates to Ministerial decisions that a referred proposal is not a controlled action (including decisions that it is not a controlled action if undertaken in a particular manner). Such decisions will cease to have effect after five years if the action is not substantially commenced.

Significant changes have been made to the bilateral agreement framework and the reconsideration framework. We will provide more detailed updates on these critical processes in the near future.

Unacceptable impacts

For each protected matter, the Bill sets out a range of unacceptable impacts. An approval cannot be granted for a proposal which will have an unacceptable impact.

National interest proposals

The Minister will, however, have a specific discretionary power to approve the taking of an action that would be inconsistent with a Standard, results in unacceptable impacts, or does not deliver a net gain for nature, in circumstances where:

The proposed action is a ‘national interest proposal’; and

The Minister is satisfied that, if the approval of the taking of the action is inconsistent with one or more of the Standards, the inconsistencies are reasonably necessary for the taking of the action to result in the intended outcome for national interest.

The Bill provides a process for a proponent to apply to the Minister for a determination that the taking of an action is a ‘national interest proposal’. The information that is required to be included in any such application will be included in subsequent regulations. In considering the proposal, the Minister will consider the intended outcome of the proposal and whether that outcome is in Australia’s national interest. This may include considerations of Australia’s defence, security, strategic interests or international obligations.

National interest exemption

The Bill provides for an expanded national interest exemption, which would be subject to conditions and limited to a specific timeframe. When deciding whether to grant a national interest exemption, the Minister may consider Australia’s defence, security or a national emergency (but may consider other matters). The exemption was recommended in the Samuel Review as something to be granted in only extraordinary and rare circumstances. However, the provisions in the Bill do not constrain the Minister’s power or discretion. Any decision to grant a national interest exemption must be supported by a statement of reasons.

No climate trigger – but emissions reporting mandatory

Despite extensive debate, there is no new ‘climate trigger’. Proponents will be required to disclose emissions and mitigation measures, but greenhouse gas considerations are simply informational. We foreshadowed this in our previous article (which you can find here), which reflects the Government’s intention to continue addressing climate policy through the Safeguard Mechanism.

Transitional arrangements

If the Bill passes, the provisions will commence by proclamation, or within 12 months of Royal Assent (whichever is earlier). Different transitional arrangements will apply to different projects:

Projects with a referral decision but no final decision will continue to be assessed under the current provisions of the EPBC Act (including projects assessed under existing bilateral arrangements);

Projects with no referral decision at the time the provisions commence will generally be subject to the amended legislation; and

Amendments to the bilateral agreement framework will generally apply to agreements entered into or varied on or after the date of commencement.

The new assessment and approval requirements will not apply to projects currently under assessment which have received a referral decision but are yet to be finally determined.

These amendments will have a significant impact in project design and assessment timelines, particularly for major infrastructure, renewable energy, critical mineral, and housing projects.

Offsets and restoration contributions

The Samuel Review criticised the EPBC Act environmental offsets policy, finding that it was “ineffective at compensating for loss and inconsistently implemented”.

Currently, environmental offsets may be required as a condition of EPBC Act approval to ensure that a project does not result in a net loss to protected matters.

Offsets, ‘net gain’ and mitigation hierarchy enshrined

The EPBC Act Reforms propose to enshrine environmental offsets in the EPBC Act, consistent with a new “avoid, mitigate, repair, offset” hierarchy (the ‘mitigation hierarchy’) and net gain requirement,

When might offsets be required?

Under the EPBC Act Reforms, offsets may be required if an approval to undertake a controlled action is issued and there is a “residual significant impact” on protected matters (i.e. where they will not be avoided, mitigated or repaired).

Where an action will have a residual significant impact on a protected matter, the Minister can impose conditions on the approval, requiring the project proponent to:

Compensate or offset the impact; and/or

Pay a restoration contribution charge.

In making such a decision, the Minister must consider whether the project proponent has taken appropriate measures to avoid, mitigate or repair the relevant impact or damage to protected matters.

Offsets for residual significant impacts must also pass the ‘net gain test’ under the Bill, without which the taking of an action cannot be approved by the Minister. The net gain test is met if the approval includes a condition requiring the holder to compensate for damage and / or pay a restoration contribution charge, and requirements prescribed in the regulations are met. It is possible for the Minister to approval a national interest proposal even where the net gain test is not satisfied.

Payment as alternative to securing direct offsets (restoration contribution charge)

The Minister cannot impose a condition on an approval requiring the payment of a restoration contribution charge unless the proponent consents to the condition.

The amount of the restoration contribution charge will be calculated using a methodology to be prescribed in further regulations. This will factor in the complex range of costs that would be required to deliver restoration actions, including monitoring, management and other administrative costs.

The restoration contribution charge will be paid into the new Restoration Contributions Special Account. A new independent office of the Restoration Contributions Holder will be created to deliver on restoration actions strategically directed at offsetting aggregated impacts from projects which have been approved subject to conditions requiring a ‘net gain’.

It is understood that a Standard for offsets will be released shortly, which will contain the requirements for delivery of offsets.

Nature Repair Market certificates’ use for offsetting purpose

The Bill will modify the current prohibition under the Nature Repair Act 2023 (Cth) on using biodiversity certificates issued under that Act for an environmental offsetting purposes.

Certificates will be able to be used to offset impacts if:

The methodology determination for the registered biodiversity project specifies that a biodiversity certificate for the project may be used for an environmental offsetting purpose; and

Any requirements under the Nature Repair Market are met.

When offsets cannot be used

As an approval cannot generally be granted for a proposal which will have an unacceptable impact, offsets cannot be used to compensate for unacceptable impacts on protected matters.

Potential impacts

Creating a government procurer of offsets (that is, the Restoration Contributions Holder) will provide flexibility to achieve larger, landscape-scale conservation and restoration actions funded by project proponents. This may also create potential revenue streams for landowners within conservation zones.

The ability for biodiversity certificates to be used for environmental offsetting purposes brings an opportunity to increase the demand for biodiversity certificates under the Nature Repair Market.

Regional planning

The EPBC Act currently includes two mechanisms for approving actions at a landscape scale, thereby facilitating the consideration of cumulative impacts. These are bioregional plans and secondly, endorsement of a policy, plan or program following a strategic assessment. Actions undertaken in accordance with a bioregional plan or an endorsed policy, plan or program do not require separate approval under Part 9 of the EPBC Act.

The Samuel Review concluded that both bioregional plans and strategic assessments have a history of limited use. The Environment Protection Reform Bill 2025 (Cth) seeks to address recommendations of the Samuel Review in relation to bioregional plans and strategic assessments. The Bill does not propose to make wholesale changes to strategic assessment so we have focused on the bioregional planning framework below.

Bioregional plans

The Environment Protection Reform Bill 2025 (Cth) repeals most, if not all, of the existing provisions pertaining to bioregional plans and starts afresh. Under the new regime, a bioregional plan will apply to a specified region, and will identify:

Development zones, and the class of action (or classes of actions) that can be undertaken in each development zone (referred to as a ‘priority action’);

Conservation zones, and the class of action (or classes of actions) that are prohibited in each conservation zone (referred to as a ‘restricted action’); and

Bioregional restoration measures (i.e. measures required to mitigate, repair or compensate for likely damage to nationally protected matters, such as the payment of a bioregional plan restoration contribution).

A proponent will be able to undertake priority actions in development zones without requiring further approvals under the EPBC Act, if they have registered the priority action and comply with the relevant conditions contained in the bioregional plan. Restricted actions will not be able to be undertaken in a conservation zone, unless the proponent has obtained an exemption.

The boundaries of development zones and conservation zones will be determined having regard to certain specified matters such as the location and habitat of any listed threatened species, ecological communities or migratory species.

A proponent will (generally) not be able to refer an action for assessment and approval under other relevant provisions of the EPBC Act if the action is addressed under a bioregional plan.

Before making a bioregional plan, the Minister must be satisfied that impacted nationally protected matters will be compensated to a net gain. Bioregional plans will be initiated and developed in collaboration with States and Territories, and they cannot be made by the Minister without the relevant State or Territory’s agreement.

Implications

The new bioregional plans will allow proponents to identify both ‘go’ and ‘no-go’ zones for development, providing greater certainty in relation to project approvals and reducing assessment timelines in ‘go’ zones.

It is understood that a number of bioregional plans are already in the pipeline, including plans relating to renewable energy projects (Victoria and Queensland), critical mineral projects (Victoria and Queensland), and urban development (South East Queensland and New South Wales).

While increased certainty is good for proponents, it is also anticipated that an uptake in the use of strategic assessments and bioregional plans will result in better environmental outcomes, by shifting the focus from impacts at a project level to a landscape scale, thereby better accounting for and addressing cumulative impacts.

However, the determination of ‘no go zones’ will need to be carefully managed to ensure they do not adversely affect property values.

Environment Information Australia

A separate Environment Information Australia Bill 2025 (Cth) (EIA Bill) has been reintroduced, remaining largely consistent with the 2024 version (discussed here), with the exception that the definition of ‘nature positive’ and associated monitoring and reporting frameworks have been removed. The EIA Bill establishes a new statutory framework for the provision, management and reporting of environmental information and data at the national level.

The EIA Bill creates the independent position of Head of Environment Information Australia (Head), located within the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) but operating independently of direction by the Secretary or Minister. The Head is responsible for:

Providing the Minister and the CEO of NEPA with high quality environmental information and data relevant to their statutory functions;

Providing the community with access to high quality information and data relating to the environment;

Preparing and publishing biennial State of the Environment reports by 15 December, drawing on scientific and First Nations knowledge;

Developing environmental economic accounts in collaboration with the Australian Bureau of Statistics, to statistically describe the condition of the environment and its relationship with the economy, which will be tabled in Parliament; and

Declaring and maintaining a register of national environmental information assets.

Within six months of each State of the Environment report, the Minister will be required to table a response in Parliament, specifying the environmental targets to be achieved and the period to achieve them. These are the national environmental goals.

The Explanatory Memorandum states:

These responsibilities would require the Government to regularly consider its environmental policy settings and targets and respond with actions to protect the environment.

The provision of a public environment data portal is also anticipated.

Entrusted persons will be able to use or disclose certain information in accordance with the EIA Bill, with civil penalties for unauthorised use or disclosure of protected information. An entrusted person is defined narrowly and includes the Head, public servants in DCCEEW and prescribed persons performing functions or exercising powers under the EIA Bill.

The EIA Act will commence concurrently with the National Environmental Protection Agency Act, and will be subject to five-yearly independent reviews. Further detail will be provided in ministerial rules and the anticipated Standard for environmental data, once available.

Working with First Nations partners

The Samuel Review identified shortcomings in the EPBC Act for failing to fulfil its objectives regarding the role of Indigenous Australians in protecting and conserving biodiversity, working in partnership with them and promoting the respectful use of their knowledge. The EPBC Act does not require explicit consideration of First Nations’ values and knowledge when making environmental and heritage management decisions.

Consultation and engagement

The EPBC Act Reforms seek to improve and enshrine consultation and engagement requirements with First Nations peoples.

Under the reforms, the Minister must invite the Indigenous Advisory Committee to provide comments before making, varying or revoking a Standard that relates to engagement with Indigenous Australians. The proposed ‘no regression principle’ will require the Minister to be satisfied that appropriate consultation or engagement with Indigenous persons will not be reduced, before varying or revoking a Standard.

The Government has indicated that a separate Standard for First Nations consultation will be released in due course, We are unaware of any consultations on the Standard to date.

The EPBC Act Reforms propose to also expand the role of the Indigenous Advisory Committee to providing input on a range of matters, including the environment, policies, plans or programs developed under the EPBC Act, and responding to requests for advice from DCCEEW or NEPA.

Heritage protections

Anticipated concurrent reforms to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) have not yet been tabled, and there is no indication from the Government about whether we are likely to see a draft package of amendments to this Act.

The Government has not sought to establish an Indigenous Engagement and Participation Committee and has instead maintained the existing Indigenous Advisory Committee, a strictly advisory body that is unable to make binding requirements on matters relevant to First Nations peoples.

Next steps and how to have your say

The EPBC Act Reform bills have now been introduced to Parliament, and the reform process has entered its next phase. The Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee is tasked with examining the legislation and yesterday confirmed that the inquiry, which was initially expected to conclude within a month, will instead report in five months.

While the Government originally signalled an intention to expedite passage of the legislation before the end of 2025, this timeline has since been revised.

The extension provides stakeholders with a longer window in which to engage with the detail of the reforms, and make submissions before the deadline on 5 December 2025.

Please contact us if you would like more information about the reforms, assistance with planning for future projects, or support in preparing submissions for the Senate Committee.

We will be hosting a series of sector-focused roundtables and webinars exploring the reforms. You can subscribe for future updates here.

In addition, at the Ohio plant, GM said it will lay off 550 workers indefinitely.
GM said it will cut production at its Detroit EV plant to just one shift starting in January, compared with the two shifts at present after earlier layoffs at the plant.
“The UAW will continue to fight for more investment in both (internal combustion engine) and EV production at GM and beyond,” Fain said.
In a separate restructuring move, GM cut about 500 white-collar jobs in the last week, the company said.","General Motors said it will cut U.S. electric vehicle and battery production and 1,200 factory jobs at its EV plant in Detroit along with 550 jobs at an Ohio battery plant as the automaker responds to a significant slowdown in demand for its battery cars.

The Detroit automaker said it will halt battery cell production at its two U.S. joint-venture battery plants – in Tennessee and Ohio – in January for about six months. It added it will also temporarily lay off about 1,550 workers at the battery factories.

In addition, at the Ohio plant, GM said it will lay off 550 workers indefinitely. GM operates the Ohio plant jointly with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution 373220.KS.

GM said it will cut production at its Detroit EV plant to just one shift starting in January, compared with the two shifts at present after earlier layoffs at the plant. This will cut output by about 50%, it said. The plant produces three large electric pickup trucks, including the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, as well as the EV Escalade IQ and Hummer SUV.

Slower EV Adoption

GM said the cuts were “in response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment.” GM lobbied Congress and the White House to ease emissions requirements and last month also cut its EV production.

Automakers in the U.S. are backpedaling hard on their EV plans, anticipating a sharp drop in consumer demand following the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers. Some executives and analysts have said EV sales – which exceeded 10% of overall U.S. car sales over the summer – could fall by half in coming months.

Nissan 7201.T, Jeep-maker Stellantis STLAM.MI and other automakers have canceled plans for future electric models. Earlier this month, GM said it was canceling production of its electric BrightDrop van, citing slow development in the commercial EV van market.

Sam Fiorani, vice president at research firm AutoForecast Solutions, said he expected more U.S. auto industry EV job cuts to follow and “lower EV production than we’ve seen over the last few years and higher prices.”

GM has been paring its outlook for EV sales and made other EV production cuts this year.

United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain blasted GM for the job cuts, noting the company raised expected annual profits to $13 billion this month. “The UAW will continue to fight for more investment in both (internal combustion engine) and EV production at GM and beyond,” Fain said.

In a separate restructuring move, GM cut about 500 white-collar jobs in the last week, the company said.

In 2021, GM said it planned to transition to all EV sales by 2035 and boosted spending, but has since been retrenching.

GM CEO Mary Barra said last week “with an evolving regulatory framework and the end of the federal consumer incentives, it’s clear that near-term EV adoption will be much lower than planned.”

She added that GM expected to reduce EV losses in 2026 and beyond.

The company took a $1.6 billion charge earlier this month related to changes in its EV strategy.

GM shares closed down 1% at $69.19 at midday on Wednesday. The shares have gained more than 35% so far this year.

The measure contains multiple provisions to tackle rising energy costs while transitioning Illinois to a cleaner, more reliable grid.
The legislation incentivizes measures that lower electricity prices by addressing the demand for energy and increasing grid capacity through things like energy storage.
“Taking action with energy relief will reduce rate hikes and save customers billions — proving that we don’t have to choose between investing in new technologies, lowering utility bills and keeping clean energy jobs in Illinois,” Cunningham said.

“Nationwide, we’ve seen electricity bills skyrocket this summer,” said Cunningham, a Democrat who represents portions of Chicago and the Southwest Suburbs. “Without meaningful relief, this trend will continue – leaving families and small businesses to foot the bill for a broken system.”

Senate Bill 25 aims to give Illinois new tools to reduce utility rate hikes, strengthen the state’s power grid, expand renewable energy sources and keep bills low for consumers. The measure contains multiple provisions to tackle rising energy costs while transitioning Illinois to a cleaner, more reliable grid.

The legislation incentivizes measures that lower electricity prices by addressing the demand for energy and increasing grid capacity through things like energy storage. Battery storage lowers costs over time — meaning consumers will be on track to save more than $13 billion over the next 20 years with the added three gigawatts of energy storage provided by Senate Bill 25.

“The oil and natural gas industry is both a major electricity consumer and the supplier of the natural gas that fuels nearly half of Texas’ power,” said TXOGA President Todd Staples.
Total in-state consumption averaged 15.6 bcf/d, including 7.6 bcf/d for industry and 7.3 bcf/d for electricity generation.

According to the report, total electricity demand in ERCOT rose 4.2% year over year in Q3 2025, marking a 25% increase since 2020, as population, industrial activity, and data center growth continue to expand. Natural gas supplied 47.6% of ERCOT’s total generation, more than wind and solar combined, while thermal and other dispatchable resources provided at least half of ERCOT’s power in more than 90% of all hours this quarter.

“The oil and natural gas industry is both a major electricity consumer and the supplier of the natural gas that fuels nearly half of Texas’ power,” said TXOGA President Todd Staples. “Reliable and affordable electricity is a key pillar in the foundation of the Lone State State’s economy, and natural gas generation continues to ensure both, powering homes, businesses, and industry while supporting continued economic prosperity and environmental progress.”

ERCOT’s total generation has increased nearly 25% over the past five years, with natural gas, wind, and solar driving most of the gains. Yet even as renewable generation expands, firm, dispatchable power remains essential. The region’s net peak load, the maximum hourly level of power required when wind and solar output decline, reached approximately 70 gigawatts (GW) in Q3 2025, underscoring the capacity ERCOT must maintain to ensure grid reliability.

“Natural gas remains the single most important source of power in ERCOT,” TXOGA Chief Economist Dr. Dean Foreman said in a news release. “It offers unmatched scale, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness — the stability Texans depend on to meet rising demand, integrate renewables, and keep electricity affordable.”

The report also highlights the abundance of Texas natural gas supply. TXOGA estimates that Texas produced an average of 28.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of dry natural gas in Q3 2025, about four times more than ERCOT’s power sector consumed. Total in-state consumption averaged 15.6 bcf/d, including 7.6 bcf/d for industry and 7.3 bcf/d for electricity generation. Since 2020, power-sector gas use has increased 15%, reflecting sustained growth in dispatchable generation and industrial demand.

The Texas Electricity Power Pulse will be published quarterly to provide policymakers, media, and the public with clear, fact-based insights into how ERCOT’s performance and Texas’ natural gas production together underpin the state’s energy reliability and economic vitality.

TXOGA remains committed to advancing policies and investments that ensure safe, reliable, and affordable energy for Texas, the nation, and global partners. For more insights and data, and to view the full TEPP report, visit txoga.org/economics.

Developers and project proponents said there is no need to worry over the Saline Township project.
DTE Energy CEO Joi Harris earlier Thursday announced a deal to provide 1.4 gigawatts of load to a data center, which is the OpenAI project.
The project, when completed, may be Michigan’s first hyperscale data center amid a surge of demand for AI and cloud computing capacity.
Whitmer met virtually with OpenAI’s boss, as well as representatives from Related Digital and DTE, in mid-March for a more formal conversation.","“Today, we won the largest economic project in Michigan history,” Whitmer said in a Thursday news release.

The announcement comes in the wake of some high-profile flameouts on major manufacturing projects, including a proposed microchip factory near Flint that previously could have been the largest economic project in Michigan history until backers pulled the plug earlier this year.

OpenAI's push comes amid a mad dash of spending on data centers that has accompanied the gold rush in AI.

Part of OpenAI’s $500 billion Stargate project in the U.S., the Saline Township data center is being developed by Dallas-based Related Digital and would be operated by Austin-based Oracle Corp., which would lease the computing power to OpenAI.

The data center, spanning 1.65 million square feet across three buildings, would come with 450 permanent “high-skill, high-paying” jobs on site as well as 1,500 permanent jobs throughout Washtenaw County to support the project. The state and developers did not immediately respond to Crain's inquiries on what those jobs would consist of.

Construction is expected to start early next year, creating 2,500 union trades jobs, according to the release.

Michigan is not providing cash subsidies to the project, according to Whitmer’s office, though data centers do have incentives to build in the state. Thursday’s announcement comes 10 months after the governor signed bills to exempt data centers from paying the state’s 6% sales and use tax on equipment if they spend at least $250 million to build or expand.

A sponsor of that legislation, Sen. Kevin Hertel, D-St. Clair Shores, said it ""served as the catalyst for us to secure the largest investment in Michigan's history. This is a monumental win for the hardworking families who call our state home.""

The companies would not disclose a dollar figure for the project cost, but the governor's office said it is higher than the largest corporate investment announced previously in Michigan, which was General Motors Co.’s $7 billion electrification expansion. Much of the investment in a data center is in the computing equipment that the center houses.

“This project will help ensure Michigan is a key part of building the AI infrastructure that will power the next generation of American innovation,” said Peter Hoeschele, OpenAI’s vice president of industrial compute, in a Related Digital news release. “By expanding Stargate to Michigan, we can strengthen domestic supply chains, create good jobs, and help more communities share in the economic opportunities AI is creating.”

Data centers have been cropping up across communities throughout the U.S. as Google, Meta, Amazon and others plunge massive amounts of capital into the AI arms race.

Not all communities have been welcoming.

In Washtenaw County alone, plans for a $1.2 billion University of Michigan-Los Alamos supercomputer in Ypsilanti Township sparked public backlash, a proposed data center in Augusta Township sought by New York City-based Thor Equities faces resident pushback and in Saline Township — where OpenAI announced Thursday it will plant its flag — board trustees tried unsuccessfully to block the development.

“We’re a bunch of farmers and want to keep it that way. I hate to say it, but we’re the last of them,” Tom Hammond, a Saline Township board trustee, told Crain’s in July. “We’ve always promoted staying rural. We love our farming community and everything. I guess that’s my stance on it.”

In September, Related Digital and three sets of local property owners sued the township after its board, with support from residents, blocked the developer’s request that the agricultural land be rezoned as industrial/research property. The lawsuit alleged “exclusionary zoning.”

The parties settled a month later, with the township agreeing to the rezoning and Related agreeing to pay $14 million, including $8 million to fire departments, $4 million to preserve farmland and $2 million for “community investment.”

Data centers have stoked concern among residents over environmental impact, water usage and increased energy costs for ratepayers. Developers and project proponents said there is no need to worry over the Saline Township project.

DTE Energy CEO Joi Harris earlier Thursday announced a deal to provide 1.4 gigawatts of load to a data center, which is the OpenAI project. She said the utility’s customers would not pay more due to the data center and would benefit because the company would not have to seek as high of a rate increase in the future.

""DTE Energy is supplying 100% of the power to the project using existing resources augmented by a new battery storage investment — financed entirely by the project — in a way that ensures there is no impact on DTE’s existing customers’ energy supply or rates,"" the release said.

Developers are also boasting that the project is a LEED-certified design, which uses a closed-loop system for cooling, limiting daily water use “to levels comparable to an office building.”

“We are proud to be developing this critical project exclusively for Oracle and contributing to keeping our nation competitive in the global AI race,” said Jeff Blau, CEO of Related Companies and Chairman of Related Digital, in the release.

Related Digital is a subsidiary of New York City-based Related Cos., which was founded by University of Michigan megadonor Stephen Ross in 1972. Ross has no formal role with Related Digital, a spokesperson said. He is the nonexecutive chairman of Related Cos but stepped away from operations last year to launch a new company, Related Ross, focused on development in West Palm Beach, Fla.

The project, when completed, may be Michigan’s first hyperscale data center amid a surge of demand for AI and cloud computing capacity. Jackson-based Consumers Energy, whose electric service territory includes much of the Lower Peninsula outside of metro Detroit and the Thumb, announced a hyperscale data center in July but has not released the center’s developer or its location pending a final agreement.

The Saline Township project, nicknamed “The Barn” in a nod to a historic red barn being preserved near the site entrance, is composed of three 550,000-square-foot buildings. It is being funded by a “consortium of leading private investors and financial institutions.”

Detroit-based Walbridge was selected as the general contractor for the project, which still must be approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission.

Michigan has been hurting for a big economic development win, having seen a flurry of electric vehicle and cleantech projects go kaput in recent months, including the collapse of the Gotion factory near Big Rapids. A $60 billion Sandisk microchip factory near Flint fell from its grasp this summer.

Whitmer had her eyes on OpenAI for the past year and her office reached out to the company in the second half of 2024, spokesman Bobby Leddy said. Following OpenAI’s announcement in January that it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, Whitmer’s office contacted the company about landing a Stargate site in Michigan.

Whitmer met virtually with OpenAI’s boss, as well as representatives from Related Digital and DTE, in mid-March for a more formal conversation.

“I’m grateful to these cutting-edge companies for betting on Michigan, building on our work to compete for and win big projects in next-generation industries from cars and clean energy to semiconductors and batteries,” Whitmer said.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Related%20Digital%20Saline%20Project%20Rendering%208-1-25_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 00:19:10.907179

October 2025 Gaps Progress Report Released by ANSI Electric Vehicles Standards Panel

NEW YORK, Oct. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In an effort to support the safe, widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and associated infrastructure across the nation, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) released today the October 2025 Gaps Progress Report. This vital document reflects efforts by standards developing organizations (SDOs) and other stakeholders to address the gaps identified in the Roadmap of Standards and Codes for Electric Vehicles at Scale, published in 2023 by the ANSI Electric Vehicles Standards Panel (EVSP). The progress report provides updates on standards, research, and conformity assessment activities against 31 previously identified gaps. It also captures suggested modifications to existing gaps, such as prioritization and scoping, and identifies 21 additional gaps to be considered for future roadmaps.

The June 2023 roadmap identified 37 standardization gaps and corresponding recommendations across the areas of vehicle systems, charging infrastructure, grid integration, and cybersecurity. Of the 37 gaps, 14 were identified as high priority, 20 as medium priority, and three as low priority. In 23 cases, additional pre-standardization research and development activities were identified as needed. Representatives from 130 public- and private-sector organizations supported the roadmap's development, including U.S. federal government agencies and national laboratories, SDOs, industry, academia, and others.

The gaps report is not a consensus document, but rather is intended to serve as a ""living document"" that will be maintained and periodically re-published as standards development work continues or until the EVSP undertakes a next version of its roadmap.

The ANSI EVSP is a cross-sector coordinating body whose objective is to foster coordination and collaboration on standardization matters among public- and private-sector stakeholders to enable the safe, mass deployment of EVs and associated infrastructure in the United States with international coordination, adaptability, and engagement. It does not itself develop standards.

The next gaps progress report is expected to be issued in spring 2026. To receive future updates, suggest edits to the report, or to get involved in EVSP activities, email evsp@ansi.org. For more information, visit www.ansi.org/evsp.

In 2009, at least 12 Duke Energy employees submitted comments to EPA advocating for weak coal ash regulations that would do little to change coal ash disposal practices.
They deny that coal ash contains toxic heavy metals, or that it harms North Carolina’s waterways.
Capping and sealing is highly ineffective as it leaves coal ash in place to pollute in perpetuity.
While the public continues to bear the costs of coal ash pollution, Duke Energy spent $5.99 million in 2013 alone on federal lobbying including efforts to block protective coal ash regulations.","Four days after the Southeast’s most recent coal ash disaster began, Duke Energy has yet to stop coal ash flowing into the Dan River. The impoundment failure is now the nation’s 3rd worst coal ash disaster and 13 additional Duke Energy power plants lurk across the state with old ash impoundments, already cited in lawsuits as problematic. The murky grey plume of toxic waste continues to travel downstream and is now entering Danville, VA’s drinking water intake. Officials there continue to say the water is safe to drink despite the lack of lab results from NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) testing for toxic heavy metals in the contaminated river or the drinking water itself.

Test results from Waterkeeper Alliance show that heavy metal levels are significantly higher than drinking water standards allow. Their independently verified samples taken at the site of the spill show arsenic levels that are 35 times higher and lead at 1,000 times greater than EPA drinking water standards. Since the spill began, both Duke Energy and the NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources have been slow to update the public on developments. Groups on the ground now tell us the utility may be trying to block public access to the river near the coal ash spill.

Today, Duke Energy announced it will address coal ash storage issues at eight retired plant sites across North Carolina, including at the Dan River plant. It’s a shame and a sham for the public that it takes this kind of disaster for Duke Energy to finally admit their impoundments are outdated and to start doing the right thing to clean up its coal ash. Duke has fought against proper, comprehensive regulation of the toxic waste for years.

In 2009, at least 12 Duke Energy employees submitted comments to EPA advocating for weak coal ash regulations that would do little to change coal ash disposal practices. In these comments, Duke argued that protective safeguards will cost the utility too much to implement and claim everything is fine. They deny that coal ash contains toxic heavy metals, or that it harms North Carolina’s waterways.

“Utilities have safely managed [coal combustion residuals (CCRs)] in hundreds of surface impoundments for decades… Our surface impoundments are sound, and we are committed to continue operating them safely.” Testified George Everette, Director of Environmental and Legislative Affairs for Duke Energy at public hearings for a federal coal ash rule on Sept. 14, 2010.

In today’s statement, a Duke spokesperson said the utility will consider two methods for closing impoundments: “capping and sealing” where ash is left in place and covered with a thick membrane and complete removal of ash to lined landfills. Unfortunately this announcement sounds much better than it really is and has no binding timeline or commitment.

Capping and sealing is highly ineffective as it leaves coal ash in place to pollute in perpetuity. The absence of an impermeable linerunderneath the ash means toxic heavy metals can continue to leach into soil, ground and surface waters. Capping is an outdated closure method and would not have prevented the Dan River spill. It is an unacceptable plan for dealing with Duke’s 16.7 billion gallons of ash across the state.

Before this disaster, DENR had determined the Dan River plant was operating illegally and Duke chose to do nothing. This spill was a failure of Duke’s routine maintenance, it wasn’t caused by a natural disaster or extenuating circumstances, reinforcing the reality that it’s nearly impossible to safely operate these old coal ash impoundments. The only effective means of addressing these impoundments is to remove the ash away into new dry, lined landfills that are safely away from public waterways, just like Santee Cooper plans to do in South Carolina.

There is plenty of evidence (in addition to the ongoing Dan River spill) to the contrary; that’s why the state of North Carolina is suing Duke Energy to stop coal ash pollution. While the public continues to bear the costs of coal ash pollution, Duke Energy spent $5.99 million in 2013 alone on federal lobbying including efforts to block protective coal ash regulations.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-31 01:58:27.460420

Meanwhile, a new frontier is opening in Arkansas, where companies are tapping the Smackover formation for direct lithium extraction.
Lithium Valley can’t assume it will be the nation’s lithium hub by default — it must prove it can deliver both production and justice.","California just broke a record. Nearly three in ten new cars sold in the state in the third quarter of 2025 were zero-emission vehicles, the highest share ever recorded. While the demand was partly driven by the sunsetting of federal tax credits for new EV purchases, analysts also think the fundamentals are in place: consumer interest in clean transportation remains strong, and California continues to lead the nation toward a more sustainable future.

But even as the state accelerates toward electrification, Washington is putting on the brakes. The Trump administration has rolled back federal clean-energy programs, cut EV infrastructure funding, and opened new channels of support for fossil fuels. At the same time, it has taken an equity stake in the Nevada-based Thacker Pass mine, which is developing an environmentally destructive hard-rock lithium mining operation over the objection of environmental organizations and most local Native American tribes. In short, the race to build America’s clean-energy future has become a contest—not just between technologies or regions, but between competing visions of what a transition to clean transportation and energy means. And nowhere are those tensions more visible than in California’s Lithium Valley, the geothermal-rich region around the Salton Sea that our book Charging Forward spotlighted last year as a microcosm of the broad climate challenges we face.

From Promise to Pushback

A year ago, we argued in Charging Forward that the clean-energy transition would only be part of a “just transition” if the communities living at its frontlines were full partners in shaping it. That principle is being tested now in the fight over the Hell’s Kitchen Lithium and Power Project being spearheaded by one of the major would-be producers, Controlled Thermal Resources.

In September 2025, Comité Cívico del Valle (CCV) (‘Civic Committee of the Valley’) and Earthworks released The Devil is in the Details, a powerful report detailing deep community concerns with the project’s Environmental Impact Report. They argue it underestimates the risks to water supplies, ignores air-quality and toxic-waste implications, and fails to safeguard sacred Indigenous lands around the Salton Sea.

But this is not just a story of opposition. A new regional coalition, Valle Unido por Beneficios Comunitarios (‘United Valley for Community Benefits’), is pressing for a Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) that would guarantee tangible returns to frontline communities such Niland, Westmoreland and Calipatria. The coalition is committed to securing a CBA with all the major companies pursuing lithium extraction, while ensuring the highest environmental mitigation measures in projects and developments in the region. The fight highlights what was foreshadowed in the documentary A Better Next Big Thing by our colleague Jacob Kornbluth: to ensure that clean energy doesn’t reproduce the extractive dynamics of the past, “community benefits” shouldn’t be about handouts after the fact, but about shared governance from the start.

Imperial County’s Stalled Lithium Valley Plan

Imperial County’s ambitious Lithium Valley Specific Plan (LVSP) is supposed to help further shared governance by offering a blueprint for managing the region’s transformation — a 51,000-acre plan for clean-energy industry, infrastructure, and community development around the lithium extraction sites. But nearly a year after the draft was released, the LVSP remains unfinished and over budget. The county extended public comments into May, and in July approved another round of funding that brought the contract’s total cost above $3.2 million. The accompanying Environmental Impact Report still hasn’t been finalized.

As San Diego State University builds out a state-funded $80 million STEM facility in the region to support lithium related research and education, its president recently expressed concern that the delay has bred frustration and risk. Developers want certainty, community groups want safeguards, and both are losing faith in the process. Without a completed plan, every project becomes an ad hoc negotiation, weakening oversight and eroding public trust.

Thacker Pass, Arkansas, and the Battle for Lithium’s Future

While California tries to balance the speed of the market with the speed of trust, other regions are racing full speed ahead. The Thacker Pass mine in Nevada is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of national policy, but the joint venture between Lithium Americas and General Motors has been criticized for its extensive surveillance and monitoring of multiple community, Indigenous, and environmental groups opposed to the environmentally destructive project. The Trump Administration recently took an equity stake in the operation, effectively turning the federal government into a shareholder in the most damaging form of commercial lithium extraction.

Meanwhile, a new frontier is opening in Arkansas, where companies are tapping the Smackover formation for direct lithium extraction. This geological formation has long been exploited for oil and gas extraction. The Standard Lithium/Equinor project recently received a $225 million DOE grant and published a positive feasibility study showing promising results. The Arkansas Lithium Technology Accelerator was launched this summer to support down-stream lithium supply chain companies, and even gas-giant Chevron is getting into the game with a pilot well in the region, their first commercial foray into lithium extraction.

Little wonder that the interest is there: despite the Trump administration’s effort to take us back to dirty fuel, automakers know the future lies in EV’s. Globally, electric car sales were more than 17 million in 2024, accounting for more than 20% of all cars sold. Nearly half of all cars sold in China are EVs, and emerging markets in Asia and Latin America saw electric car sales expand by over 60% in 2024. This resilience highlights a central contradiction of the moment: while federal policy veers toward fossil retrenchment, market and consumer momentum continue to accelerate the clean transition from below.

The Crossroads of Power and Justice

One year after Charging Forward was published, the tensions it explored have become sharper than ever. The Salton Sea’s geothermal brine remains uniquely rich, but its high-temperature and complex chemistry makes extraction challenging and commercially uncertain. Lower-temperature brines in Arkansas may be easier to manage, and Nevada’s environmentally destructive projects now enjoy federal backing. Lithium Valley can’t assume it will be the nation’s lithium hub by default — it must prove it can deliver both production and justice.

Bridging that divide is more complex than ever. Communities in Imperial County are organizing for fair treatment. Imperial County’s long-promised development plan languishes, while rival regions advance their own lithium strategies. Federal policy has swung toward fossil favoritism, seeming to buck clear trends in global and other markets.

The big question now isn’t whether the clean-energy transition will happen: it will. But the question is where, how, and for whom. The outcome will depend on whether communities like those around the Salton Sea can secure a real voice in shaping the industry that will transform their landscape, and whether California’s momentum can withstand federal retrenchment and competitive headwinds.

Charging Forward argued that a just transition must be built, not assumed. One year later, that remains the challenge. The race is on, and it’s not just about who extracts the lithium first: it’s about who builds the future right.",https://dornsife.usc.edu/eri/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/Charging-Forward-Blog-Post-Featured-Image-1024x589.png,N,,2025-10-31 01:18:05.277642

They require billions of dollars in upfront investment, to be financed by battery developers and secured through surcharges on consumers’ monthly utility bills.
Deregulation didn’t provide as much new electricity for the state as hoped, said Mark Pruitt, former director of the Illinois Power Agency, a state energy regulator.
“This is us responding to the federal cuts in a really robust way that no other state has done,” Walling said.","SPRINGFIELD — Sweeping energy-related legislation that backs the use of big batteries to help make wind and solar power more effective but has raised questions about whether it will increase or decrease energy bills cleared the Senate Thursday night and will be headed to Gov. JB Pritzker, who signaled he would sign the measure into law.

Legislative Democrats said the legislation would eventually lower electric bills for Illinois consumers burdened by utility rate spikes driven by rising power grid demand, while Republicans noted the massive battery installations would be backed in part by a surcharge on consumers’ monthly bills.

The disagreement over the 1,020-page energy bill, mostly along party lines, was reflected in the final 37-22 vote in the Senate on Thursday night, the final day of the General Assembly’s fall session and the last scheduled legislative day of 2025. On Wednesday night, the House approved the bill 70-37. Democrats hold supermajorities in the House and Senate.

After the Senate passed the legislation, Pritzker said in a statement that the bill, dubbed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, is “an important step that will help lower utility bills and make our electrical grid stronger.”

“Illinois is leading an ambitious clean energy effort that will make our electrical grid more resilient, power our economy, and make energy more affordable for everyone,” the governor said. “I am grateful for working with the Illinois General Assembly and I look forward to signing this bill into law and help Illinoisans keep costs lower and keep the lights on.”

The legislation’s passage comes despite concerns from Republicans, particularly those downstate who’ve repeatedly raised alarms in the last several months about increased utility rates, that the energy policy changes would actually raise monthly electric bills.

The bill was a result of negotiations between lawmakers, organized labor, environmental interests and other groups in response to an especially high demand for electricity in the last couple of years.

Part of this has been attributed to the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which aims to promote greater use of renewable energy by 2030 and eventually phase out fossil fuels, and to the prevalence of data centers that have taken up a significant share of the electrical supply due to the emergence of artificial intelligence technology.

State Rep. Jay Hoffman of Swansea, the energy bill’s main House sponsor, warned during floor debate Wednesday night about how not passing the legislation could have grave consequences for consumers, especially at a time when the federal government has sought to cut spending.

“Some would say let’s do nothing. Let’s put our head in the sand and act like just everything’s going to be OK and do nothing. Don’t do planning. Don’t put more capacity on the grid. Don’t make sure that we have energy efficiency,” he said. “But let me tell you this: Without immediate actions, Illinois stands to pay $9.5 billion in increased energy costs by 2034. Utility bills will directly increase by $1 billion by 2030, and Illinois will lose more than 50,000 manufacturing and energy jobs because of the federal budget cuts.”

But House Republicans questioned the delayed gratification the new bill promised.

Some savings from CEJA “never materialized,” Republican state Rep. Dan Ugaste of Geneva said, “and now we’re taking another swipe at it, hoping we get some cost savings at some point in the not-too-distant future. Our ratepayers are suffering now.”

Republican state Rep. Brad Halbrook, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus who represents Shelbyville, took it even further, calling the bill and previous attempts at energy legislation a “worship service at the altar of the dead green God.”

“We were promised clean energy would mean lower costs, more jobs and a stronger grid. They promised a climate salvation that doesn’t exist,” Halbrook said.

State Rep. Ann Williams, a Chicago Democrat who was one of the lead sponsors of CEJA, disputed claims that the 2021 law won’t save money for consumers by 2030, and also said battery storage in the new bill will “increase power on the grid and keep costs down.”

“Affordability is at the very heart of this energy package and a direct response to consumer concerns about rising utility rates,” she said during Wednesday’s floor debate.

As part of the energy bill, legislators called for adding 3 gigawatts of battery storage to the state’s electricity grid by 2030 — though Republicans and Democrats still disagreed on whether and how quickly the batteries would lower monthly bills enough to pay for themselves.

The batteries would work in tandem with wind and solar to make the electricity they supply less intermittent.

They require billions of dollars in upfront investment, to be financed by battery developers and secured through surcharges on consumers’ monthly utility bills.

But according to an estimate released Monday by the Illinois Power Agency, the batteries would shave a few dollars per month off average residential electricity bills by 2031 by lowering anticipated rate increases for future space on regional electricity grids.

The cost of getting 3 gigawatts of batteries up and running on the grid by 2031 would add 58 to 68 cents per month to the average residential bill for Ameren customers in mostly downstate Illinois and 40 to 48 cents for Commonwealth Edison customers in the Chicago region, according to the IPA analysis.

However, the agency said, the batteries would pay for themselves by reducing the anticipated rate increases for future space on regional transmission grids. In total, by 2031, the batteries would reduce average Ameren residential bills by $3.90 to $8.28 per month and average ComEd residential bills by $1.46 to $1.85 per month, the agency said.

Including all its other provisions, the energy bill would reduce average Ameren residential bills by $4.49 to $10.59 per month and average ComEd residential bills by $1.46 to $2.03 per month by 2031, the IPA said.

In one big policy change from the new energy bill, for the first time since deregulating energy markets in 1997, the legislature would allow the Illinois Commerce Commission to sign long-term contracts and allow higher utility bills to procure new sources of electrical generation in the state.

Deregulation didn’t provide as much new electricity for the state as hoped, said Mark Pruitt, former director of the Illinois Power Agency, a state energy regulator.

That’s because regional grid operators, such as the Midwest Independent System Operator and PJM Interconnection, have been reluctant to hook up intermittent sources such as wind and solar, despite their declining cost, he said.

The state’s policy shift comes as Illinois faces looming electricity shortages not just because of rising demand from data centers, but also because of its plan to close 28 gigawatts of coal and natural gas generating plants by 2045 to improve air quality.

The ICC and other agencies plan to issue a final report by mid-December on the adequacy of the state’s electricity supply through 2030.

In addition, the bill would fund pilot programs for geothermal energy networks, repeal the existing moratorium on new large-scale nuclear construction and increase subsidies to retrofit homes to use less energy.

Mark Denzler, president of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, dismissed the projected savings as the kind of Springfield promise that often fails to materialize.

“There’s too much of a rate hike that we think is going to cause a negative reaction for Illinois families and Illinois businesses,” Denzler said in a news conference on Monday.

Even with its new batteries, Illinois won’t have enough round-the-clock or baseload power and will still need to delay the planned closing of coal and natural gas power plants, Denzler said.

Jen Walling, executive director of the Illinois Environmental Council, said her group supports the bill as a way to offset changes in federal policies, such as the phasing out of tax incentives for wind and solar power.

“This is us responding to the federal cuts in a really robust way that no other state has done,” Walling said.

“It’s going to mean we’ll save more through efficiency. It’s going to mean building more renewable energy. It means new money for battery storage, but we expect that to be a savings very quickly to consumers, as it has been in other states,’’ she said.

“The program is not a quota program,” West said Thursday.
“This program was passed when (George) W. Bush was governor of Texas, and he was not a governor that would have accepted a quota program.
“All it does is create opportunities for smaller, disadvantaged businesses to be part of the procurement network for the state of Texas,” West added.
The law also set statewide goals for HUB participation in state contracts based on the 2009 State of Texas Disparity Study.","The state program intended to give additional exposure to businesses owned by women, minorities and disabled veterans seeking state contracts was frozen by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts’ office this week, the latest instance of Republican state officials targeting a program perceived as promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.

Information regarding the Historically Underutilized Business program was removed from the comptroller’s website and the office said it was pausing the issuance of all new and renewed certifications for state procurement, according to a statement by the comptroller’s office.

The office said it was freezing the program to allow for a review to ensure it is constitutional and complies with Gov. Greg Abbott’s January executive order banning DEI programs from state agencies.

“Businesses deserve a level playing field where government contracts are earned by performance and best value — not race or sex quotas,” acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock wrote on social media Tuesday. “We must END ALL DEI in Texas!”

Hancock’s social media posts were coupled with a memo to state agencies and universities saying they are prohibited from granting contracts on the basis of race, ethnicity or sex.

While his office has stopped issuing new certifications, Hancock does not have the power to end the program altogether.

The program, in its current form, was written into state law over the course of several legislative sessions during the 1990s. Doing away with the program would require either a court ruling it unconstitutional or the Legislature repealing the law.

State Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, co-authored the 1999 bill that codified the program into state law and said its opponents misunderstand the program’s intent and effectiveness.

“The program is not a quota program,” West said Thursday. “This program was passed when (George) W. Bush was governor of Texas, and he was not a governor that would have accepted a quota program. We were able to strike what we thought was a good compromise, a fair program that made sure agencies would go out and make an effort to seek procurement opportunities.

“All it does is create opportunities for smaller, disadvantaged businesses to be part of the procurement network for the state of Texas,” West added.

That legislation placed the program under the purview of the comptroller’s office, which is tasked with certifying HUB businesses and monitoring other state agencies for compliance in their procurement processes. A business can be certified under the program if a majority of its ownership is determined to be an “economically disadvantaged person,” defined by the state as Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Americans and disabled veterans.

The law sets requirements for state agencies to solicit bids from a set number of HUB-certified businesses, but does not require that a HUB-certified business must be selected for a given contract.

The law also set statewide goals for HUB participation in state contracts based on the 2009 State of Texas Disparity Study. That study was also removed from the comptroller’s office on Tuesday.

Michael Adams, a professor and director of the Master of Public Affairs Graduate Program at Texas Southern University, said programs seeking to increase the participation of women and minority-owned businesses in the public procurement process are present in all levels of government across the country.

With government representation of minorities still lagging behind their population, programs like Texas’ HUB program were seen as a way of helping historically disenfranchised groups by taking advantage of government’s status as the nation’s largest employer to fight discrimination, Adams said.

“How do you move beyond the public welfare state if you don’t have the opportunity to strike out and create a business and create opportunity for yourself?” Adams said. “In terms of policy outputs, the HUBs have been a way of doing that.”

West said the program has not been a political issue throughout most of its existence, arguing the recent attention is a result of Republican attempts during President Donald Trump’s second term to roll back decades of progress toward societal equity.

“It’s all part of the Project 2025 plan,” West said, referencing an ultra-conservative political initiative published by Heritage Foundation in preparation for Trump’s second term. “Many of the cultural wars in America start in Texas … Now we’re trying to further Trump’s goals to do away with any programs that give people a hand up, not a hand down.”

West noted that women-owned businesses are by far the biggest benefactor of the HUB program, “but the focus by Republicans has been on the poster child, which are African American owned businesses.”

Hancock took office in July in an acting role after former Comptroller Glen Hegar was named chancellor of the Texas A&M University System. Hancock said the review of the program has been a top priority since he took office.

The decision comes after Austin-based recruiting company Aerospace Solutions sued the state last November arguing the HUB program puts it at a disadvantage when bidding for state contracts because it is not a HUB-certified company.

Mitigating climate change requires rapid reductions in emissions, and fossil fuels are the biggest source.
Their production continues due to sustained financial support, despite renewable energies now being cheaper than fossil fuels.
While I have mentioned that we already have the solutions to phase out fossil fuels, there is a broader issue.
Then, the citizen support towards climate action is actually higher than we perceive.","Ultimately, they found that the 180 largest fossil fuel and cement companies have been responsible for about half of the world’s carbon emissions dating back to the 19th century. Moreover, many 21st-century heat waves would not have been possible without them. “We knew it was going to cause some noise,” Quilcaille says. “So, we went above and beyond to make sure what he had was clear and that it was as robust as possible.”

The study has already created a stir among climate scientists, and Quilcaille expects that its findings will be used in legal proceedings against emitters. (He stresses that while the study assesses contributions, it does not assign direct responsibility for climate events.) “My hope is that more will follow in these tracks,” he says of the need for further accountability research. “It’s important for society to know how these big actors are impacting our lives.”

Quilcaille answered TIME’s survey on the state of the climate movement:

What is the single most important action you think the public, or a specific company or government, needs to take in the next year to advance the climate agenda?

The financial support towards the production of fossil fuels must be transferred towards renewable energies. Mitigating climate change requires rapid reductions in emissions, and fossil fuels are the biggest source. Their production continues due to sustained financial support, despite renewable energies now being cheaper than fossil fuels. Thus financial institutions need to acknowledge that it is now a rational action, for the environment and for the economy, for today and for the future.

What’s one sustainability effort you personally will try to adopt in the next year?

I will continue shifting my diet, towards more plant-based food. Changing my habits takes time, but it makes sense for my health, our environment, and global well-being.

What is a climate solution that isn't getting the attention or funding it deserves?

While I have mentioned that we already have the solutions to phase out fossil fuels, there is a broader issue. Most of us are consuming and wasting too much: food, transport, energy, transport, clothing, etc. The priority should be on goods that are better distributed, with less waste, of higher quality, and that lasts longer. Thanks to our consuming choices, we can redefine the markets and reduce our individual footprints.

What gives you hope about the future of the planet?

First, it is not in my personality to give up: I have set my mind to make as much of a difference as I can, so I will. Then, the citizen support towards climate action is actually higher than we perceive. We have the solutions, we have the motivations, so I hope that we are getting close from a societal threshold that would trigger cascading decisive actions.

If you could stand up and talk to world leaders at the next COP, what would you say?

Today, you have a chance to change the world. Instead of plunging towards a fragmented and decaying world, you have the power to progress together towards a sustainable world. This path is the most rational for our economies, our societies, our resources and the environment, be it today and tomorrow. You have an opportunity to be remembered as the leaders that saved our world, and this is not an exaggeration.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Leaders-Yann-Quilcaille.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-10-30 23:22:15.648366
