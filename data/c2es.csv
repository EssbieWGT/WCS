U.S. Power Rental Market

Dublin, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""U.S. Power Rental Market - Strategic Assessment & Forecast 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The U.S. Power Rental Market was valued at USD 5.30 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 8.27 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 7.70%.

The U.S. power rental market is dominated by major players such as United Rentals, Sunbelt Rentals, Herc Rentals, and Home Depot. These companies hold significant U.S. power rental market share due to extensive fleets, nationwide presence, and strong brand recognition. Beyond the major players, the market includes many regional and local rental companies. These smaller firms often compete on price, customer service, or specialization in niche sectors (e.g., events, construction, or emergency services).

Growing environmental regulations and customer demand for sustainability are driving competition toward hybrid generators, battery storage, and lower-emission equipment. Companies offering green or Tier 4 Final-compliant equipment are gaining favor in the U.S. power rental market. The U.S. power rental market has experienced significant merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in recent years, with companies actively expanding their power rental capabilities. In 2025, Herc Holdings completed the acquisition of H&E Equipment Services, further expanding its equipment rental portfolio and market reach. This strategic move strengthens Herc's position in the construction and industrial sectors.

The Southern U.S. holds the largest share of the U.S. power rental market. States like Texas, Florida, and Georgia have significant construction, oil & gas, and manufacturing activities that drive demand for power rentals. Large infrastructure developments, including power plants, commercial buildings, and data centers, increase rental needs. Furthermore, the West holds a significant share, reflecting strong activity, especially in states like California, Washington, and Colorado. Renewable energy projects (solar, wind) and mining operations contribute to the demand for mobile power solutions. Wildfires and droughts create demand for emergency power solutions.

The Midwest remains a manufacturing powerhouse requiring temporary power for maintenance, shutdowns, and expansions. Large-scale construction projects (e.g., energy infrastructure projects, highways, bridges) often require temporary power solutions. Furthermore, the Northeast's industrial sector needs backup and supplemental power to avoid production downtime. Large-scale events, festivals, concerts, and sports events require mobile power solutions, especially in urban centers.

US POWER RENTAL MARKET TRENDS & DRIVERS

Shift Toward Clean and Hybrid Solutions

Innovations in energy storage are revolutionizing portable power, making it more efficient and more sustainable. Leading the transformation are battery energy storage systems (BESS). A BESS paired with a mobile power generator forms a hybrid power solution that produces lower emissions or zero emissions and consumes significantly less fuel. For instance, Aggreko provides 100 kW Tier 4F Generator Rental, with innovative features that reduce regulated emissions (NOx, CO, VOCs) to near-zero levels, reduce fuel usage and costs, arc Flash detection and physical safety barriers to provide safety to the operators, and more.

Rise in Infrastructure Development

The surge in infrastructure development in the U.S. is driving demand for temporary power solutions in construction and industrial projects, particularly in remote or underserved areas. As projects like roads, bridges, and urban development expand, flexible and reliable power rental options are essential for meeting energy needs.

For instance, in January 2025, OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle are investing up to $500 billion in the Stargate initiative to build 10 to 20 large-scale U.S. data centers, aiming to support AI infrastructure. This project is expected to drive significant growth in the data center and construction industries. These facilities often require substantial and continuous power supply, leading to a higher reliance on power rental services to meet their energy needs during peak loads or as backup solutions.

INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS

Fluctuating Fuel Prices

Gasoline is the most common fuel source for portable generators. A standard 5-kilowatt generator will typically consume about 0.75 gallons per hour. The portable generator for a day, that would consume about 18 gallons, meaning the cost to run the generator would be more than $52 a day. The price of gas does fluctuate, which can make running this type of portable generator expensive over a prolonged period. Fluctuating diesel prices directly impact the U.S. power rental market, which depends heavily on diesel generators.

INSIGHTS BY FUEL

Diesel has the highest incremental opportunity in the U.S. power rental market and is preferred over other fuels as it is more easily available. Despite reservations and resistance from environmental groups, regulators and localities are reluctantly approving diesel generators because of the current grid realities - specifically, the lack of reliable renewable infrastructure, limited energy storage capacity, and the urgent need for dependable backup power during peak loads or grid instability. Furthermore, other segments are gaining traction with an increase in power generation through renewable sources to enhance clean energy practices.

INSIGHTS BY POWER RATING

In 2024, the above 1,000 kVA segment accounted for 40% of the revenue share in the U.S. power rental market. The increasing need for reliable, high-capacity power solutions in industries such as construction, manufacturing, and large-scale events has fueled demand for powerful rental generators capable of supporting heavy machinery and critical operations.

Additionally, the growing emphasis on backup power systems for data centers, hospitals, and commercial buildings amid rising concerns over grid reliability and natural disasters has further boosted the uptake of high-capacity units.

That law represented the U.S.'s largest investment to address climate change, allocating more than $300 billion clean energy projects over a decade.
The Biden law extended tax credits through 2032 for large clean energy projects, residential energy-saving improvements, electric vehicles and charging stations.
Since nonprofits received access to the tax credits in 2023, roughly half of Catholic Energies' clients have opted to utilize them to reduce costs of clean energy projects.
In April, he took part in a rally opposing the elimination of the clean energy tax credits.","Catholic parishes, schools and houses of worship across the country pursuing wind and solar projects were dealt a major financial blow in President Donald Trump's domestic-policy and tax-cut bill signed into law on July 4.

The law curtails federal spending for renewable energy, cutting off a major funding source that many faith-based organizations have tapped to make their projects more affordable. Among the impacted projects are a multimillion dollar plan to put solar panels on schools throughout the Archdiocese of Los Angeles as well as the first solar installation on a school in a Florida diocese.

""It's just making projects more expensive,"" said Page Gravely, who heads the Catholic Climate Covenant's Catholic Energies program that assists church organizations on solar and other energy installations.

A piece of the ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act,"" narrowly passed by the Republican-controlled Congress, effectively ends for now a Biden-era program called ""direct pay"" that for the first time allowed tax-exempt organizations and religious institutions to take advantage of clean energy tax credits through a cash payment received from the IRS. The tax credits reduce costs of an energy project through money coming back as a government payment.

When the program first began in 2023, it was touted as a ""game changer"" for faith communities in particular, and delivered a long-time goal of faith organizations for federal assistance with energy projects. The U.S. Catholic bishops' conference for years has lobbied Congress for such financial support.

The credits Congress has now eliminated would reduce the costs of clean energy investments like solar arrays, wind farms, battery storage and geothermal systems by at least 30%. The savings could have risen to as much as half the cost of the project if it meets other factors, such as using union labor or building in a low-income area.

What the Big, Beautiful Bill Act eliminates

Clean energy tax credits eliminated in the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act were first enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

That law represented the U.S.'s largest investment to address climate change, allocating more than $300 billion clean energy projects over a decade. It was designed to meet the U.S. target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 Paris Agreement and was seen as an environmental milestone.

The Biden law extended tax credits through 2032 for large clean energy projects, residential energy-saving improvements, electric vehicles and charging stations.

Trump’s big bill phases out tax credits for environmental projects, including electric vehicles (in September) and home-energy efficiency improvements and electric vehicle charging stations (at the end of 2025).

The ""direct pay"" incentives for religious groups were based on the tax credits that the Trump law eliminates. With those tax credits eliminated, so will the ""direct pay"" incentives. Those incentives were paid to tax-exempt organizations in the form of a check from the Internal Revenue Service; the checks were the same value that an individual might have received in the form of a tax refund for using the same program.

At Sacred Heart Catholic Church, in northern Omaha, the parish completed two solar projects in the past 18 months that still qualified for the tax credits. It expects to receive cash payments of $18,000 for the 24-kilowatt system ($45,000 cost) on its office building and $70,500 for the 70-kilowatt solar array that cost $235,000 to install at the parish school.

""We could not have afforded that without the direct pay program,"" pastor Fr. David Korth said.

While President Donald Trump's new law leaves the direct pay program untouched, the tax credits for solar and wind developments are now only available for projects that begin construction within one year of the bill's enactment; all other projects must be placed in service by the end of 2027. Other projects like geothermal and battery storage must begin construction by the end of 2033.

The law also places new restrictions on the tax credits, for instance, barring materials for clean energy projects from ""prohibited foreign entities,"" which widely refers to China.

The actions by Congress come even as nearly 60% of clean energy spending from the Inflation Reduction Act has occurred in Republican-held congressional districts.

The dismantling of federal climate policies follows Trump's second withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and other efforts by his administration to wipe out climate and environmental programs.

The Republican legislation ""is a very, very bad bill for clean energy,"" said Jack Pratt, senior political director with the Environmental Defense Fund.

Religious groups urged to act fast or lose funding

Pratt said the law is especially a blow for religious organizations and nonprofits looking at energy upgrades for moral and economic reasons but may lack funds for expensive upfront costs.

""If you're a smaller entity, then you really are reliant on these incentives to help you overcome that first hurdle, even for something that's paid off over several years,"" Pratt said.

As it followed the legislation's developments, Catholic Energies encouraged church organizations considering solar to make decisions in the next 90 days in order to utilize the federal energy credits.

""There is a sense of urgency,"" Gravely said. ""We're just telling clients that you got to act if you're really serious about solar and you want to optimize"" a project's finances with the federal energy credits.

Since nonprofits received access to the tax credits in 2023, roughly half of Catholic Energies' clients have opted to utilize them to reduce costs of clean energy projects. Often, those savings not only have helped lower bills but have allowed churches and schools to redirect more funds toward ministries serving their communities.

The Los Angeles Archdiocese is partnering with Catholic Energies for a multimillion dollar project that would initially install solar arrays at nearly two dozen of its 240 schools. The loss of federal energy credits is expected to result in millions of dollars less in energy cost savings that the archdiocese could otherwise reinvest in teachers and Catholic education.

Another Catholic Energies project in the works would construct the first solar installation for one Florida diocese, where the energy tax credits would reduce costs by at least $450,000. The savings available through federal incentives made the project's economics more attractive because Florida is one of at least six states that bars power purchase agreements, according to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency. In a power purchase agreement, a third-party developer pays for the solar array, while claiming any tax benefits, and then sells the power from the system to the customer, often at a lower, fixed rate.

The final text of Trump's domestic agenda law mostly took aim at tax incentives for solar and wind developments. An earlier draft in the House sought to eliminate all clean energy tax credits for all projects not under construction within 60 days of it becoming law, and requiring they be placed in service by the end of 2028.

Those terms could have spelled trouble for the Sisters of St. Benedict, who are in the process of constructing a 200-well geothermal system to heat and cool some of its oldest buildings at Monastery Immaculate Conception, in Ferdinand, Indiana.

The $10 million project, begun in 2024 and set to complete in 2026, was initially financed on their own through donors and a bank loan. The sisters said they planned to apply for the federal tax credit, which could save $3 million-$4 million. If the credit was lost, they would be forced to tap into savings set aside for the sisters' retirements.

In Omaha, Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart, an all-girls Catholic high school, has planned to apply for an energy tax credit to offset a portion of its own $2 million geothermal system that is set to finish construction in summer 2026.

""We're just trying to do the right thing for the world,"" Meg Brudney, Duchesne head of school, said.

An economic and moral loss

Before Trump signed the law July 4, Archbishop Timothy Broglio, the president of the U.S. bishops' conference, criticized its ""devastating effects,"" including cuts to programs protecting God's creation.

""Vulnerable communities will be less prepared to cope with environmental impacts of pollution and extreme weather,"" he said in a July 3 statement.

Earlier, Broglio warned in a letter to Congress that the bill's clean energy and environmental cuts would harm both God's creation and future generations.

Another letter from bishops to senators also decried the reductions.

""Cuts will also lead to increased pollution that harms children and the unborn, stifles economic opportunity, and decreases resilience against extreme weather,"" the bishops wrote. ""These changes will also discourage clean energy companies from investing in or continuing operations.""

Members of Catholic Climate Covenant in late June delivered copies of Pope Francis' 2015 encyclical ""Laudato Si', on Care for Our Common Home,"" to every Catholic member of Congress, including Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who along with five other senators sought some protections of the energy tax credits in the bill.

It was from reading Laudato Si' a decade ago that Korth, the pastor at Sacred Heart and member of the Omaha Archdiocese's Laudato Si' commission, felt compelled to move to renewable power, but only if it made financial sense for his parish and school in one of Omaha's poorest zip codes, already facing a tight budget.

In April, he took part in a rally opposing the elimination of the clean energy tax credits. While projects at his parish are complete, the Omaha Archdiocese viewed the federal credits as a means of financing its own plans to expand solar power across its hundreds of buildings.

""All of that is really on hold,"" Korth said.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-07/IMG_1777.jpg?h=fd920bc7&itok=rei00k3A,N,,2025-07-08 05:01:13.313562

FAIRFIELD, CA / ACCESS Newswire / July 7, 2025 / Waste Energy Corp (""Waste Energy"" or the ""Company""), (OTCQB:WAST), an emerging leader in sustainable waste-to-energy innovation, today announced it has signed a long-term lease-with an option to purchase nearly four acres of Industrial property in Midland, Texas. The property will host the company's first Waste to Energy conversion system and will serve as the new Waste Energy corporate headquarters.

""Texas generates, refines, and consumes more diesel than any other state in America, giving us unrivaled proximity to feedstock, fuel buyers, and logistics,"" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman & CEO of Waste Energy Corp. ""Our Midland hub puts us at the center of the nation's rising energy needs-driven by the rapid growth of data centers, electric vehicles, and next-generation technologies-at a time when demand for reliable fuel sources are reaching levels not seen in decades. By converting plastic and tire waste into clean-burning (ULSD)ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, we're not just meeting that demand-we're turning one of the world's biggest environmental problems into a powerful energy solution.""

Why Texas? A Century of Fuel Leadership

Historical scale: Texas' 34 refineries can process nearly 6.3 million barrels per day-about one-third of total U.S. capacity.

Top consumer: The state of Texas consumes more ULSD annually than both California and Florida combined, driven by heavy industry, agriculture and freight.

Permian Basin advantage: Midland offers pipeline, rail and interstate access for both incoming waste feedstock and outgoing refined products.

Surging U.S. Power Demand: A Decade of Unprecedented Growth Ahead

The U.S. is entering a new era of energy demand, driven by the explosive growth of data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), Web3 infrastructure, and the reshoring of industrial development:

The U.S. Department of Energy projects data centers alone could consume up to 12% of the nation's electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023.

Goldman Sachs estimates global data center power use will rise by 50% by 2027, fueled by next-gen computing needs.

McKinsey forecasts U.S. data center demand will more than triple to 80 gigawatts by 2030.

In Texas, grid operator ERCOT expects peak power demand to nearly double by 2031, driven by large-scale digital and industrial expansion.

This wave of demand puts enormous pressure on the grid and creates a critical need for reliable backup power and decentralized diesel fuel sources.

WEC domestically produced fuel supports grid resilience, fuels industrial operations, and turns harmful waste into a vital energy solution.

Throughout this document whenever “we,” “us,” or “our” is used, we mean EPA.

I. Background

On July 30, 2021, Ohio EPA submitted a revision to its SIP to address regional haze for the second implementation period, supplemented it on August 6, 2024, and clarified it on June 16, 2025.[ ] Ohio EPA made this SIP submission to satisfy the requirements of the CAA's Regional Haze Program [ ] pursuant to CAA sections 169A and 169B and 40 CFR 51.308.

On August 30, 2024, EPA proposed to approve Ohio's Regional Haze SIP revision. A detailed analysis of Ohio's plan and EPA's evaluation are contained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), dated August 30, 2024 (89 FR 71124), and will not be restated here. In the NPRM, EPA proposed to find that Ohio's Regional Haze SIP submission as supplemented satisfied the regional haze requirements for the second implementation period contained in 40 CFR 51.308(f), including the incorporation by reference of Director's Final Findings and Orders (DFFOs) with specific emissions rates in Ohio's long-term strategy into the SIP at 40 CFR 52.1870(d) at three power plants (Cardinal Power Plant, General James M. Gavin Power Plant, and Ohio Valley Electric Corp.—Kyger Creek Station) and retirements by 2028 at two power plants (Miami Fort Power Station and Zimmer Power Station).

On June 16, 2025, Ohio clarified in a letter that Zimmer Power Station Unit B006 retired in 2022 and that Miami Fort Power Station is considering converting Units B015 and B016 to natural gas in lieu of permanently shutting down. As such, Ohio stated that the DFFOs for these two facilities are not necessary for reasonable progress and are no longer part of its SIP submittal. Ohio EPA confirmed the past retirement of Zimmer Power Station Unit B006 is already permanent and federally enforceable.[ ] Additionally, Ohio EPA also concluded that the DFFO for Miami Fort Power Station is not necessary for reasonable progress. Although not relied upon for reasonable progress, Ohio EPA affirms that Miami Fort Power Station continues to be required through Ohio EPA-issued Orders at the State level to either permanently shut down B015 and B016 or convert to natural gas in 2028.

II. Public Comment Process

The public comment period on EPA's proposed rule opened August 30, 2024, was extended until October 15, 2024, was reopened on a limited basis on February 28, 2025, and finally closed on March 17, 2025. 89 FR 71124, August 30, 2024; 89 FR 76442, September 18, 2024; 90 FR 10876, February 28, 2025. During this period, EPA received relevant comments from the following individuals, businesses, agencies, and organizations: Buckeye Power, Inc. and Ohio Valley Electric Corporation ( printed page 29994) (Comment 1); Anonymous (Comment 2); Anonymous (Comment 3); U.S. Forest Service (USFS) (Comment 4); National Park Service (NPS) (Comment 5); Coalition to Protect America's National Parks (Comment 6); Black Environmental Leaders, Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, Junction Coalition, National Parks Conservation Association, Northeast Ohio Black Health Coalition, Ohio Environmental Council, and Sierra Club (Environmental Groups) (Comment 7); and National Parks Conservation Association, Sierra Club, Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, Ohio Environmental Council (Conservation Groups) (Comments 8-21); and Buckeye Power, Inc. and Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (Comment 22).

III. Summary of Public Comments and EPA's Responses

All comments received are included in the rulemaking docket for this action. In the June 17, 2025, Response to Comments document, which is included in the docket for this rulemaking, EPA provides full detailed responses to all significant comments received that further explain the basis for our final action.

EPA received comments on the NPRM addressing topics including, but not limited to, new emission limits, docket organization, cost considerations, visibility, enforceability of retirements, enforceability of permit conditions, existing effective controls, four-factor analyses,[ ] CAA considerations, Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART), enforceability of Ohio's administrative orders, State-to-State consultations, Federal Land Manager (FLM) consultation, environmental justice, regional planning organization work products, incorporation by reference, Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) considerations, and renewable and nuclear energy options. The comments, while partially summarized below, are available in full in the docket for this rulemaking and are fully addressed in the June 17, 2025, Response to Comments document.

Comments received from Buckeye Power Inc., which operates Cardinal Power Plant, and Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, which operates Kyger Creek Station, were supportive of the proposed rulemaking and of the new emission limits for those facilities that Ohio EPA effectuated through DFFOs.

USFS expressed concern regarding EPA's consideration of costs/sales ratios as well as the comparison of emission reductions from already implemented shutdowns and fuel conversions to potential additional emission reductions.

NPS provided alternative considerations regarding the four-factor analyses and effective controls demonstrations submitted by Ohio for General James M. Gavin Power Plant, Cardinal Power Plant, Ohio Valley Electric Corp.—Kyger Creek Station, and Carmeuse Lime, Inc.—Maple Grove Operations. NPS also asserted that, at times, Ohio's implementation of the FLM consultation process did not follow the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(i)(2) and (3).

The Coalition to Protect America's National Parks raised concerns about the number of industrial facilities in Ohio, their disproportionate impact on communities of color and low income, and their impact on Ohio's residents in general.

The Environmental Groups raised concerns about the impact of emissions from General James M. Gavin Power Plant on public health and regional haze in certain mandatory Class I Federal areas.[ ]

The Conservation Groups commented on benefits of improved visibility at Class I areas that would also improve public health. The Conservation Groups questioned the enforceability of permanent shutdowns, and whether the commitments to shut down 15 units by 2028 was as an adequate reason not to require new emission controls on these units. The Conservation Groups also questioned the enforceability of permit conditions requiring certain facilities to convert to natural gas and limited use. By forgoing four-factor analyses for Ohio Valley Electric Corp.—Kyger Creek Station, Cardinal Power Plant, and FirstEnergy Generation LLC—Bay Shore Plant, the Conservation Groups commented that Ohio failed to show that these facilities were effectively controlled and that cost-effective controls were not likely available. For the four-factor analyses that Ohio provided for General James M. Gavin Power Plant and Carmeuse Lime, Inc.—Maple Grove Operations, the Conservation Groups asserted that EPA's proposed approval of Ohio's conclusions was arbitrary and capricious and not reasonable considering the requirements of the CAA. For both facilities, the Conservation Groups commented on Ohio's consideration of visibility as a fifth factor. As an overarching concern, the Conservation Groups asserted that EPA could not exempt sources from Best Available Retrofit Technology requirements in the second implementation period. Regarding Ohio's DFFOs, the Conservation Groups questioned whether the requirements are practically enforceable, whether the terms were permanent, and whether they provide for monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping to provide adequate reporting for citizen enforcement.

The Conservation Groups also raised concerns about Ohio's implementation of the State-to-State consultation process, referring to requests from the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Visibility Union (MANE-VU) and the Visibility Improvement State and Tribal Association of the Southeast (VISTAS) for four-factor analyses, low sulfur fuel standards, and lower emission limits. As to the FLM consultation process, the Conservation Groups reiterated comments provided by the FLMs that addressed Ohio's public notice process, reasons used to forgo four-factor analyses, assumptions used in cost calculations, evaluation of certain control measures, and consideration of visibility as a fifth factor. Environmental justice was also expressed as an area of concern by the Conservation Groups. The Conservation Groups commented that the public was not given an opportunity to review or comment on the work products of the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium (LADCO) during Ohio's development of their SIP revision. As to EPA's NPRM, the Conservation Groups commented that EPA's proposed action was not clear as to how the DFFOs were to be incorporated by reference into Ohio's SIP. Overall, the Conservation Groups urged EPA to disapprove Ohio's SIP revision and issue a FIP as soon as possible.

Regarding the reopening of the public comment period to notify the public that three permits were added to the docket, Buckeye Power, Inc. and Ohio Valley Electric Corporation provided additional comments, noting that the reopening of the comment period was unexpected and unnecessary, asserting that the presence of the permits ( printed page 29995) themselves in the docket has no impact on the SIP.

As discussed in further detail in our proposed rule, this rule, the June 17, 2025, Response to Comments document, and the brief summary of those responses below, EPA finds that Ohio submitted a Regional Haze SIP revision that meets all the regional haze requirements for the second implementation period.

EPA concludes that Ohio's determinations of the measures necessary for reasonable progress were based on a reasonable consideration of the four statutory factors as discussed in the NPRM. Ohio thoroughly examined sources for existing effective controls and for potential additional emission controls through four-factor analyses. While Ohio provided information on control costs/sales ratios and visibility, Ohio did not use this information to reject potential additional emission controls. Ohio also did not reject emission controls merely because of other ongoing emission reductions. Rather, in consideration of the four statutory factors, Ohio found that potential additional controls were not cost-effective.

While some commenters suggested that Ohio should consider certain add-on control measures as cost-effective based on thresholds established by other States, the preamble to the Regional Haze Rule speaks to the flexibility afforded to States when considering the cost of compliance factor. See, e.g.,82 FR 3078, 3088, January 10, 2017. As such, EPA notes that the cost effectiveness threshold in one State should not necessarily be determinative of whether controls are cost-effective in another State.

In all cases, Ohio appropriately considered the four statutory factors and carefully weighed the potential emission controls and the large statewide reductions achieved during the second implementation period before appropriately deciding on whether further controls were necessary to make reasonable progress or needed in the State's long-term strategy. Ohio documented that 27 of the 38 coal-fired units above Ohio's threshold for source selection have either already permanently shut down, converted to limited use, converted to natural gas, or accepted enforceable limits. For the units that have already been retired, the record demonstrates that the shutdowns are federally enforceable and permanent. Based on 2016 emissions as shown in Table 4 of Ohio's SIP submittal, the shutdowns and conversions that have already taken place during the second implementation period represent statewide reductions of more than 37,000 tons per year sulfur dioxide (SO2) and 28,000 tons per year nitrogen oxides (NOX), and the conversions to natural gas add another 15,000 tons per year of SO2 reductions to that total.

For 2028 projections of emissions and visibility impairment, Ohio's technical demonstrations relied upon the thorough analysis and modeling provided by LADCO, which were subject to public notice and comment at both the State and Federal level. Based on this modeling, EPA notes that emissions from Ohio are not reasonably anticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment in any Class I areas that are above the 2028 uniform rate of progress.[ ] Section III.2. and appendix A of Ohio's SIP submission provide references to LADCO's technical support document and supporting materials. Additionally, in the 2028 LADCO modeling, Miami Fort Power Station was assumed to be operating similar to past operation in that it was not retired in the 2028 modeling scenarios. Therefore, the modeling shows that all Class I areas affected by Ohio will be below their 2028 uniform rate of progress, whether or not Miami Fort Power Station continues to operate on coal. If Miami Fort Power Station does shut down or convert B015 and B016 to natural gas, then even greater emission reductions will be realized than were modeled. Based on that information, Ohio EPA concluded, and EPA agrees, that considering the numerous other on-the-books and on-the-way controls identified in the State's long-term strategy, removing the DFFO for Miami Fort Power Station from the SIP submission will not impact Ohio's ability to make reasonable progress at the Class I areas affected by emissions from Ohio. In line with recent proposals from EPA,[ ] the Agency has determined that where visibility is below the uniform rate of progress in 2028 and the State has considered the four statutory factors, the State has presumptively demonstrated reasonable progress for the second implementation period for that Class I area, as Ohio has.

Ohio documented quantifiable and meaningful reductions in SO2 and NOX emissions and ensured improvements in actual emission rates would continue to make reasonable progress by effectuating DFFOs for Cardinal Power Plant, General James M. Gavin Power Plant, and Ohio Valley Electric Corp.—Kyger Creek Station. Although a commenter questioned the practical enforceability of the DFFOs, EPA notes that the DFFOs effectively provide that specific monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements are provided for and must be incorporated into the facilities' title V operating permits, thereby affording adequate reporting for enforcement.

Given these facts and others discussed more fully in the NPRM and June 17, 2025, Response to Comments document, EPA agrees that it was reasonable for Ohio to conclude that existing Federally enforceable measures as well as controls included in the DFFOs constitute reasonable progress for the State's long-term strategy in the second implementation period.

Although one comment asserted that EPA did not provide an independent evaluation of Ohio's four-factor analyses for General James M. Gavin Power Plant and Carmeuse Lime, Inc.—Maple Grove Operations and, as such, that EPA's proposed approval of Ohio's SIP revisions was arbitrary and capricious, EPA carefully evaluated Ohio's SIP revisions along with the associated record in the docket and documented the information the State relied upon for transparency to the public.

As to comments regarding Ohio's participation in the FLM consultation process and the State-to-State consultation process, EPA fully considered Ohio's public notices that documented the FLMs' recommendations, MANE-VU's and VISTAS' requests, and Ohio's Responses in proposing to find that Ohio's FLM and State-to-State consultation process satisfied the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(i)(2) and (3) and 51.308(f)(2)(ii), respectively.

While some comments raised concerns regarding public health, park visitation, and local economies, EPA notes that these are not considerations within the Regional Haze Program. With respect to public health concerns in particular, the primary national ambient air quality standards are among the standards that provide public health protection, including protection for the health of sensitive populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. ( printed page 29996)

Although some commenters urged EPA to disapprove Ohio's SIP revision and issue a FIP as soon as possible, as stated throughout our proposed action, this action, and the June 17, 2025, Response to Comments document, EPA has determined that Ohio reasonably considered the statutory and regulatory requirements and appropriately determined what measures are necessary for reasonable progress for the second implementation period and, therefore, a FIP is not necessary. For additional justification and rationale for this final action, please see the June 17, 2025, Response to Comments document located in the docket.

EPA is finalizing its approval of Ohio's July 30, 2021, Regional Haze SIP submission as supplemented on August 6, 2024, for the second planning period as proposed, with the exception of the DFFOs for Miami Fort and Zimmer Power Stations, after considering all comments received as addressed in detail in the June 17, 2025, Response to Comments document as well as Ohio's June 16, 2025, letter provided during EPA's review process.

IV. Final Action

EPA is approving the Regional Haze SIP revision submitted by Ohio EPA on July 30, 2021, supplemented on August 6, 2024, and clarified on June 16, 2025, as satisfying the regional haze requirements for the second implementation period contained in 40 CFR 51.308(f). EPA is finalizing the incorporation by reference into Ohio's SIP at 40 CFR 52.1870(d) the following Ohio EPA DFFOs for Cardinal Power Plant, B001, B002, and B009 (State effective date: July 26, 2024); Ohio Valley Electric Corp.—Kyger Creek, B001, B002, B003, B004, and B005 (State effective date: July 26, 2024); and General James M. Gavin Power Plant, B003 and B004 (State effective date: July 26, 2024).

V. Incorporation by Reference.

In this rule, EPA is finalizing regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, EPA is finalizing the incorporation by reference of the Ohio EPA's DFFOs described in section IV of this preamble and set forth in the amendments to 40 CFR part 52 below. EPA has made, and will continue to make, these documents generally available through www.regulations.gov, and at the EPA Region 5 Office (please contact the person identified in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this preamble for more information). Therefore, these materials have been approved by EPA for inclusion in the SIP, have been incorporated by reference by EPA into that plan, are fully federally enforceable under sections 110 and 113 of the CAA as of the effective date of the final rulemaking of EPA's approval, and will be incorporated by reference in the next update to the SIP compilation.[ ]

VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews.

Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the CAA and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve State choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this action merely approves State law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by State law. For that reason, this action:

Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget underExecutive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);

Is not subject toExecutive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) because SIP actions are exempt from review under Executive Order 12866;

Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);

Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);

Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);

Does not have federalism implications as specified inExecutive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);

Is not subject toExecutive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it approves a State program;

Is not a significant regulatory action subject toExecutive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and

Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA.

In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian Tribe has demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).

This action is subject to the Congressional Review Act, and EPA will submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by September 8, 2025. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Dive Brief:

The commercial insurance arm of German life insurance and financial services company Allianz unveiled a platform Wednesday that seeks to help businesses evaluate and mitigate the climate risk exposures they face.

Allianz Commercial said its data-driven Climate Adaptation & Resilience Services, or CAReS, platform will give companies access to consulting expertise and a self-service tool that will help them convert physical climate risks into portfolio-level financial and physical loss metrics.

The CAReS tool also aims to help companies perform assessments that will identify and highlight the key assets that have high climate risk exposure, such as assets in certain locations, supplier sites and new investments, according to the July 2release.

Dive Insight:

Allianz, the world’s largest insurer, said companies using the platform can better understand their climate-associated risks and the impact they have on company assets by utilizing the platform’s dashboard. The dashboard provides risk scores for 12 environmental “perils,” including floods, wildfires, hail, tropical storms and more. Companies can also track the impact of these climate-related disasters across four different timelines on the platform: present day, 2030, 2050 and 2080.

The insurance giant said CAReS was developed in collaboration with its clients and is the first product in a set of solutions Allianz Risk Consulting plans to unveil this year as part of a strategy that boosts the “relevance of resilience.”

“The question is not if a company is affected by climate risks in the future, but when it will happen,” Michele Williams, global head of Allianz Risk Consulting at Allianz Commercial, said in the release. “No industry is immune to risks such as floods, droughts, storms, or fires.”

Williams added that CAReS was developed to give clients the “option to address and mitigate their risks as well as to avoid surging insurance costs in the future.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ynwzIkPKM6jUu0BO3_su-UpsAJ1PWJ0gJ3BicymD1c4/g:nowe:3:78/c:1020:576/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05Njk4ODUzMC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-07-08 06:00:33.720447

His presentation will focus on meeting growing energy demand through innovative power management solutions.","Eaton is positioning manufacturing facilities as intelligent energy assets through its “Factories as a Grid” approach, which integrates onsite renewable generation, energy storage and digital management systems to address rising electricity costs and grid instability.

The power management company has developed the strategy to help manufacturers navigate electrification demands whilst maintaining operational continuity during grid disruptions.

This strategy seeks to build on Eaton’s broader Everything as a Grid framework, which provides customers with multiple energy options and creates flexible infrastructure for power security.

Currently, manufacturing operations face mounting pressure from global electrification trends and increasingly frequent extreme weather events that threaten power supply reliability.

Traditional electrical systems function as passive grid loads, but Eaton’s approach transforms these into active energy management assets that can produce, store, and consume electricity based on real-time conditions.

Balancing energy production and consumption

The company has already implemented its Factories as a Grid concept at its Arecibo, Puerto Rico manufacturing plant, which produces circuit breakers for residential, commercial, and industrial applications.

This facility integrates solar generation, battery storage, and digital control systems within a microgrid configuration that operates independently during grid outages. Ultimately, it’s designed to reduce operational costs, energy consumption, and emissions through intelligent power management.

The system can also react to grid pricing signals and weather conditions to optimise when electricity is generated, stored, or purchased from the utility network.

“There are multiple global megatrends at play impacting manufacturing. Everything is electrifying and extreme weather events are becoming more common,” says Marc Elliott, Director – mining, metals, minerals, pulp and paper at Eaton.

Brightlayer portfolio provides real-time energy data

Eaton’s Brightlayer digital platform delivers operational insights that support the Factories as a Grid approach through real-time monitoring and analytics. The software tracks energy production, consumption patterns, and equipment performance to identify optimisation opportunities and predict maintenance requirements.

The platform enables facility managers to balance energy loads across different production processes and coordinate renewable generation with storage systems. During peak demand periods, the system can automatically shift operations to reduce grid dependency or sell excess power back to utilities.

Manufacturing facilities can accommodate electric vehicle (EV) fleet charging infrastructure within the microgrid framework, which helps reduce installation costs and charging times compared to grid-only solutions.

Such an integrated approach allows facilities to manage charging schedules based on renewable energy availability and production demands.

The strategy supports decarbonisation objectives by maximising the utilisation of onsite clean energy resources. Facilities can monetise excess renewable generation through grid services or peer-to-peer energy trading arrangements, creating additional revenue streams beyond core manufacturing operations.

Marc adds: “Solving these challenges requires integrated solutions that transform electrical systems from simple loads on the grid into intelligent business assets that assure energy security.

“At Eaton, we’re leveraging our expertise and industry-leading solutions to help our customers make that happen.”

The bill sets a deadline for the department to issue its FEOC rules by the end of 2026.
It’s unclear whether every company will be able to find alternative suppliers that comply with the FEOC rules.
For some projects, that might be OK. Certain energy developments and factories will still make economic sense without tax credits.
“The industry has not yet fully absorbed the potential impact of FEOC rules, which will kick in starting in 2026,” said Moon.","President Donald Trump’s new ​“big, beautiful” law repeals many — but not all — of the U.S.‘s clean-energy tax credits. The incentives that remain, though, could still prove prohibitively complex, rendering them effectively useless for energy project developers and manufacturers.

That’s because of a provision in the bill aimed at restricting Chinese companies and individuals from benefiting from those tax credits. These restrictions on ​“foreign entities of concern” — ​“FEOC” for short — combine harsh penalties with very little guidance on compliance. The impact of rules meant to limit U.S. funds flowing to China could, ironically, be to undermine U.S. efforts to compete with China, which dominates many of the industries that will bear the brunt of the requirements, experts say.

The ramifications of FEOC rules will be felt most by developers of grid-scale battery, geothermal, and nuclear energy projects as well as by companies that produce batteries, solar panels, and critical minerals in the United States. The law preserved tax credits for these sectors until the 2030s, subject to FEOC provisions.

The FEOC provisions in the bill passed last week aren’t as strict as those that emerged from a House version of the bill in May, experts say. But they’re still complex enough that experts fear it will take the U.S. Treasury Department a long time to finalize its rules for compliance. The bill sets a deadline for the department to issue its FEOC rules by the end of 2026.

During the Biden administration, the department took a year and a half to craft rules for a much narrower set of FEOC restrictions for electric vehicle batteries under the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s unlikely the agency — understaffed and overworked following cuts from the Trump administration — will be able to finalize rules for these much broader restrictions in a timely fashion, said Ted Lee, a former Biden administration Treasury official who worked on those EV tax credits.

That puts the industry in a bind. Until the guidance is finished, it will be risky for companies to claim tax credits — and riskier yet for the investors who finance clean-energy projects and factories by purchasing these credits to offset their own tax bills. These entities would face the risk of eventually having their tax credits clawed back if they’re later found to be in violation of the as-yet-unwritten rules, Lee said, among other penalties.

“When I talk to developers, manufacturers, lawyers, and tax insurers and other participants in this market, they’re not sure how they’re going to deal with this,” Lee said. ​“There’s a risk that some projects get so burdened in compliance and red tape that projects and investments that should move forward will not be able to.”

To make matters more challenging, the IRS has a long time to challenge tax credit claims, said Andy Moon, CEO and cofounder of Reunion Infrastructure, a company that offers software and services to support the multibillion-dollar market for tax-credit transfers. The department has six years after a return is filed, and can assess a 20% penalty for incorrect claims — in addition to clawing back the value of the credit.

The confusion ultimately threatens to put hundreds of billions of dollars worth of planned investment in clean-energy projects and factories on ice while companies wait for the details to take shape. It could also sow chaos for the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of existing projects that have been built with the assumption that they could access Inflation Reduction Act tax incentives.

It’s unclear whether every company will be able to find alternative suppliers that comply with the FEOC rules. China makes most of the world’s solar and lithium-ion battery materials and components, including those used in domestic installations and factories. For some projects, that might be OK. Certain energy developments and factories will still make economic sense without tax credits. But plenty won’t.

“The industry has not yet fully absorbed the potential impact of FEOC rules, which will kick in starting in 2026,” said Moon. ​“And I think that some market participants are looking at it and raising the alarm bells.”

Crushed by complexity

In particular, the ​“material assistance” rules that go into effect next year will prove a challenge for firms, Moon said. Under those rules, factories and energy projects seeking to claim tax credits must have an increasing proportion of materials coming from companies and sources that aren’t linked to FEOC.

For manufacturers seeking credits under the Inflation Reduction Act’s 45X program, those proportions will rise from 60% in 2026 to 85% in 2030 for lithium-ion batteries, while the proportions for solar manufacturers will rise from 50% to 85% over the same time period, for example. Manufacturers of other products have their own ratios, as do wind, solar, battery, geothermal, and nuclear power projects.

It won’t be easy for companies to prove they’ve met those thresholds, Lee said. ​“To do that, you have to go through a calculation that’s described at a high level in the text” of the bill, he said. ​“But the details of how you do that calculation are somewhat unclear,” with only passing reference to existing domestic-content ​“safe harbor” guidance for solar, wind, and battery projects.

Yogin Kothari, chief strategy officer for Solar Energy Manufacturers for America, a coalition of U.S. solar-equipment makers, said that the companies in his organization are working with the Trump administration and members of Congress to forward ​“a set of rules that supports domestic manufacturers and drives demand for domestic manufacturing. Anything that undermines that will have a negative impact on these manufacturing communities.”

GOP lawmakers have good reason to develop workable rules: The vast majority of manufacturing investment generated by the Inflation Reduction Act is flowing to Republican congressional districts.

Spencer Pederson, senior vice president of public affairs for the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) trade group, highlighted the work that the organization and its member companies have taken to comply with existing ​“Build America, Buy America” rules set by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Those kinds of efforts could help companies prepare to comply with the FEOC rules set to emerge from the Treasury Department, he said.

“NEMA is going to work with Treasury as best as possible to ensure that the guidance is clear and consistent and produced in a timely enough manner for companies to use the credit for those that wish to take advantage of it,” he said. Even so, ​“there’s going to be a decision for a number of companies and organizations as to whether or not the juice is worth the squeeze.”

But some sectors don’t have an existing framework to look to. Such guidance doesn’t exist for geothermal and nuclear power projects, or for inverters and other grid equipment, noted Advait Arun, senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, a nonprofit think tank. Until the Treasury Department releases guidance on those technologies, ​“it’s going to be tough, if not impossible” for developers of those projects to know how to calculate their exposure to FEOC, he said.

Even if Treasury guidance does eventually offer some clarity, companies are almost certainly going to struggle to obtain the depth of information the FEOC rules in the bill appear to require. Companies tend to be secretive about their exact suppliers, Lee said, adding that this difficulty was part of what slowed down the Biden administration’s rulemaking around domestic content requirements.

“Even if you know what you’re trying to calculate, actually getting that information from your suppliers — and in many cases your suppliers’ suppliers,” as the FEOC rules require, Lee said, ​“is going to be extremely difficult.”

Ultimately, the extent to which this complexity slows down growth in clean energy and manufacturing construction will depend on the Treasury’s guidance, which could take years to be issued.

“I don’t know yet how hard [compliance] is going to be,” said Harry Godfrey, head of federal affairs for trade organization Advanced Energy United. ​“It depends on where the administration engages in additional guidance, and if it’s helpful — which we hope it would be — or if it is disruptive.”

Are you, or have you ever been, a member of the Chinese Communist Party?

Even before those ​“material assistance” restrictions begin next year, companies will need to prove they aren’t what the FEOC rules define as ​“specified foreign entities” or ​“foreign-influenced entities” to ensure they are eligible to receive tax credits.

“Those rules come into effect regardless of when you start construction,” Lee said.

These restrictions could embroil many factories and projects already built or under construction. More than 100 existing or planned U.S. solar or battery factories are owned by Chinese parent companies or backed by majority-Chinese shareholders, according to BloombergNEF analysis obtained by Heatmap.

Other companies ​“might not actually be owned or influenced by Chinese companies, but maybe they haven’t done all the many tests now required to prove that,” Lee said. ​“There’s going to be this immediate compliance hit, even for projects that have begun production or [are] about to get turned on.”

Companies under majority-Chinese ownership, such as Japan-based lithium-ion battery manufacturer AESC, have already frozen hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of U.S. factory plans. House Republicans have previously attacked other projects that license Chinese technology, such as Ford Motor Co.’s battery plant in Michigan that uses technology from China-based battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL).

“Effective control” provisions that direct the Treasury to write guidance that could bar tax credits to projects or factories that have made contract or licensing payments to specified foreign entities are particularly problematic, Lee said. ​“There’s an extremely broad category of things that could be caught up in that, particularly in the battery space.”

Overshadowing all these uncertainties is the fear that the Trump administration will not engage in the same good-faith approach that the Biden administration took to work with U.S. companies in their efforts to comply with FEOC rules.

Already, reports have surfaced of a deal struck between members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus and Trump, who reportedly has agreed to impose administrative burdens and aggressive interpretations of agency rules to prevent solar and wind projects from being able to use the tax credits that remain available to them over the next two years.

“Historically IRS enforcement has been independent from the political appointees in the executive branch,” Lee said. ​“The norms and laws that provide that protection are being eroded by this administration. As a result, it’s quite concerning to think about what actions the Trump administration might put pressure on the IRS to take, and what enforcement priorities this administration would have.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/trump-obba.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=42856efdfa2c30211c0bd0d23aee8115,N,,2025-07-08 04:00:23.649510

Those in the know say suppliers have been informed the start of production for two different all-electric crossover-type vehicles, slated for the Canton plant in Mississippi, has been pushed back by nearly a year. The first model, apparently codenamed PZ1K and likely to be some sort of rugged-ish machine in the style of an old Nissan Xterra, won’t see the light of day until November 2028 while an Infiniti variant of the same car is now slated for about four months after that time.

The rug was already pulled on plans for Maxima-sized EV sedans in this country, though that decision was predicated on soft demand for that type of body style on this side of the pond. This latest move is arguably in direct response to decrees contained in the so-called Big Beautiful Bill which was signed by Trump on Independence Day. In it, the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on new machines and a $4,500 chit on used ones have evaporated.

As for these two Nissans, the company says the approximately ten-month delay in production amounts to nothing more than a slight adjustment. Cynics in the room will note the new date of November 2028 neatly aligns with when the next American election is supposed to occur, determining who will occupy the White House. Read into that what you will.

Through to the end of the second quarter this calendar year, Nissan has sold 209,114 vehicles from that brand, plus an additional 12,327 units with Infiniti logos. That’s a drop of 6.1% and 12.7% respectively compared to the same time frame twelve months ago. Its sales leader was the Rogue, finding 109,563 homes; the all-electric Ariya sold 11,619 units while the Leaf found about four thousand takers.

The MeyGen tidal energy project off the coast of Scotland has four turbines producing 1.5 megawatts each, enough electricity collectively to power up to 7,000 homes annually.
Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a “very significant milestone” that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.
Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy.
With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.","Submerged in about 40 meters (44 yards) of water off Scotland’s coast, a turbine has been spinning for more than six years to harness the power of ocean tides for electricity — a durability mark that demonstrates the technology’s commercial viability.

Keeping a large, or grid-scale, turbine in place in the harsh sea environment that long is a record that helps pave the way for bigger tidal energy farms and makes it far more appealing to investors, according to the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. Tidal energy projects would be prohibitively expensive if the turbines had to be taken out of the water for maintenance every couple of years.

Tidal energy technologies are still in the early days of their commercial development, but their potential for generating clean energy is big. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, marine energy, a term researchers use to refer to power generated from tides, currents, waves or temperature changes, is the world’s largest untapped renewable energy resource.

The MeyGen tidal energy project off the coast of Scotland has four turbines producing 1.5 megawatts each, enough electricity collectively to power up to 7,000 homes annually. On Thursday, the Swedish company SKF announced that its bearings and seals on one of the turbines had passed the 6 1/2-year mark without needing unplanned or disruptive maintenance. It has been working closely with the industry for a decade on design and testing.

Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a “very significant milestone” that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.

Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy. The MeyGen site, operated by SAE Renewables, has been sending electricity to the grid for about eight years.

There are very few tidal energy projects generating electricity continuously. Most have been tests and demonstrations, said Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development. Copping said there are still large hurdles to overcome before tidal energy can be adopted more widely, such as dealing with regulatory issues, potential environmental effects and conflicts with other ocean users.

Still, the Scotland project seems to have addressed the question of whether the turbines can last in seawater, added Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

“I think they have checked the boxes,” she said. “Because skeptics, and that includes investors of course and governments, said, ‘How on Earth are you going to operate these things especially for any length of time in this very tough environment?’ And that’s what I think they proved.”

It’s very hard to take what is essentially a wind turbine normally found on land and put it under water, said Fraser Johnson, operations and maintenance manager at MeyGen. The record-setting turbine should keep going for at least another year before it needs to come out of the water for maintenance, he added.

The four turbines are in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, a narrow channel between the Scottish mainland and Stroma Island known for strong tidal currents. Tidal energy systems need strong currents to make electricity efficiently. MeyGen plans to add 20 turbines in 2030 to produce more electricity, after needed upgrades to the electricity grid are finished. The site could eventually hold as many as 130 turbines that are more powerful than those at the site today.

The MeyGen site is in the open water, while another type of tidal project involves creating a dam-like structure called a barrage across tidal waters. With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.

“It’s a title we wish we didn’t have. We want more, we want others,” he said. “Unfortunately others are having difficulty achieving what MeyGen has achieved. But working with SKF moving forward, we’ll push the industry forward.”

Republicans pushed hard for the $1.4 billion tax cut throughout negotiations.

That included expanding Wisconsin’s second income tax bracket of 4.4% for all filers and exempting the first $24,000 of retirement income for those who are at least 67 before the end of a tax year with a maximum exemption of $48,000 for married couples.

But the sales tax cut on energy bills comes as experts across the country are predicting increased electricity rates as states look to adjust their electrical capabilities to help even the supply and demand as large data centers begin to pop up across Wisconsin.

The state recently passed a pair of nuclear energy bills related to a siting study and nuclear power summit and included $2 million for the siting study in the budget.

A recent poll showed that those across the U.S. are not in favor of having data centers built in their community and even more are against it when tax incentives are involved.

The average American’s energy bill could increase from 25% to 70% in the next 10 years without intervention from policymakers, according to Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Jack Kemp Foundation.

Late last month, a federal judge in Seattle granted a temporary injunction to unfreeze $875 million in federal funds for the stations. It went into effect on July 2 as the judge cited the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act as grounds for the injunction.

16 states and the District of Columbia had sued the Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration and staff members following Trump’s executive order freezing what remained of the $3.74 billion National EV Infrastructure program (NEVI).

14 of the states were granted the preliminary injunction by the judge, including Washington.

State AG Nick Brown’s office told POLITICO’s E&E News that they expect the Trump Administration to promptly disperse the funds as Washington moves forward with infrastructure programs. Washington has approximately $55 million on the line according to court documents, what remains of the $71 million originally awarded under NEVI.

Since then, the defendants have requested an extension to respond to the ruling.

That leaves open the question of whether national agencies will still fight to block the injunction after an initial statement on July 1 said the U.S. Department of Justice would not appeal.

The analysis, which comes in response to an executive order from the White House on strengthening grid reliability and security, provides a methodology to identify areas vulnerable to outages to allow for “Federal reliability interventions.”

A 100% “surge in power outages” is expected within five years if planned power plant closures remain on schedule without new units to replace them, the Energy Department said in ahead of the report. “Staying on the present course would undermine U.S. economic growth, national security, and leadership in emerging technologies,” it said.

The report backs President Donald Trump’s pro-coal and anti-renewable approach to energy generation, painting wind and solar as unreliable and part of a “radical green agenda of past administrations.” It also comes as the Energy Department has been using emergency authority to extend the life of coal and other plants, citing concerns about shortages of electricity as data centers, which power artificial intelligence models, require more supply.

“If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

The department noted the analysis could inform use of the emergency authority in the Federal Power Act to order coal and natural gas plants to keep operating, which the administration has already used to save two plants that were slated to retire. Trump administration officials considered using similar authority during the president’s first term to help struggling coal plants from shutting down, but ultimately decided against the effort.

The report also comes on the heels of Trump’s $3.4 trillion fiscal package, which marked a deep setback to the US shift to clean energy by phasing out tax credits wind turbines and solar panels. Renewables were positioned to be leading providers of energy supply in coming years, with utility-scale solar last year accounting for 61% of US capacity additions, or 30 gigawatts, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Solar was primed for further growth because it’s the cheapest domestic electric source, batteries capable of deploying excess power in the evening have become mainstream, and it’s quicker to build than natural gas-fired plants or atomic reactors.

“The study released today by the Department of Energy appears to exaggerate the risk of blackouts and undervalue the contributions of entire resource classes, like wind, solar, and battery storage, despite the fact that regions like Texas that have enabled rapid growth of these technologies have been rewarded with lower costs and a more reliable grid,” said Caitlin Marquis, managing director at Advanced Energy United, which represents companies such as renewable developers such as The AES Corp. and Clearway Energy Inc.

According to the Energy Department, the rough equivalent of 100 nuclear reactors are set to retire by 2030 which could lead “to significant outages when weather conditions do not accommodate wind and solar generation.”

According to a report over the weekend from leading global financial newspaper Nikkei Asia, Honda Motor has “halted” development of a large electric SUV “as demand for electric vehicles in the US is expected to continue to fall”.
This would eventually morph into a goal of having EV sales account for 30 per cent of its sales by 2030.
Despite all this, Honda still reiterated its commitment to have EVs and fuel-cell vehicles make up all its new car sales by 2040.

According to a report over the weekend from leading global financial newspaper Nikkei Asia, Honda Motor has “halted” development of a large electric SUV “as demand for electric vehicles in the US is expected to continue to fall”.

The large electric SUV is believed to have been targeted for release around 2027, but Honda has slammed the brakes on its development due to sluggish demand for EVs in the United States combined with anticipated delay in EV adoption caused by the rollback of EV-friendly policies by US President Donald Trump.

Trump last Friday signed into law his so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” which discontinued tax credits designed to support purchasing a new EV. The $US7,500 tax credits for buying or leasing new EVs will end on September 30.

Honda’s decision to scrap a new electric SUV is just the latest reversal by the company that had, as recently as May 2024, announced that it had “not changed its belief that EVs are the most effective solution in the area of small mobility products such as motorcycles and automobiles.”

It said at the time that it was committed to an “electrification target to make EVs and FCEVs represent 100% of its global vehicle sales by 2040”.

In 2022, Honda announced it planned to launch 30 EV models around the globe with annual production volume of over 2 million units by 2030 and promised “to take an aggressive approach to the develop of new EV models” from 2024 onwards. This would eventually morph into a goal of having EV sales account for 30 per cent of its sales by 2030.

But in May of this year, Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe told a press conference that “it’s really hard to read the market, but at the moment we see EVs accounting for about a fifth by [2030].”

The comments were part of Honda’s announcement that it was scaling back its investment in electric vehicles in favour of hybrid electric vehicles. Specifically, Honda slashed its planned electrification investment and software by 30 per cent – down from 10 trillion yen ($US69 billion) to 7 trillion yen ($US48.4 billion).

This mirrored an earlier announcement that the company was putting a temporary hold on plans to build $US10.7 billion EV production base in Canada, once again citing slowing demand for EVs.

Despite all this, Honda still reiterated its commitment to have EVs and fuel-cell vehicles make up all its new car sales by 2040.

Reporting from Nikkei Asia last week confirmed Honda’s plans to refocus on hybrid EVs, saying that Honda was “redirecting efforts” away from investment in EVs “toward increasing production of profitable hybrid vehicles.” This is expected to result in the introduction of 13 new hybrid models from 2027 over a four-year period, with a target to sell 2.2 million units by 2030.

According to Nikkei Asia, this focus on hybrid models is only a short-term fix to “secure revenue while preparing for EV adoption”. As such, the company is still continuing with its plans to introduce a flagship electric sedan and midsize SUV, for which prototypes were unveiled in Las Vegas earlier this year.

The news was reported only a few days after Honda announced that it was also scaling back and delaying plans to begin operating a dedicated hydrogen fuel cell production plant in Japan, blaming “recent changes” in the global hydrogen market.

Honda is not the only carmaker reversing course on electrification. Iconic American automaker Ford has been steadily slowing down its own EV plans over the past 18 months, and Britain’s own iconic carmaker Jaguar Land Rover shelved plans earlier this year to build Evs at parent company Tata Motor’s planned $US1 billion factory in southern India.

Meanwhile, Japanese automotive peer Nissan reportedly cancelled its own plans to produce two electric sedans at its American factories and is also reconsidering the “development schedule” of two battery electric crossovers.",https://thedriven.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/c250108a_001H.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 04:00:34.761308

When I opened my automotive business in Beijing in 1992, cars produced by China’s then-fledgling auto industry were terrible.
Unable to compete abroad, U.S. automakers will have to retreat into the narrow space where they remain strong: the domestic U.S. market for gas-guzzling trucks and S.U.V.s.
Led by its national champion BYD, China has overtaken Detroit as the center of the global auto industry.
America can embark on an all-out push to rebuild world-class manufacturing and supply chains, or our carmakers can hide behind tariffs, continue making gas-powered trucks and S.U.V.s and fade into irrelevance.","You’ve probably heard of BYD.

A middling player in the auto industry just a few years ago, the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer surpassed Tesla last year to become the world’s top-selling E.V. brand and is expected to pull even with the world’s biggest carmakers, Toyota and Volkswagen, by 2030.

Yet most Americans have never even seen a BYD, and probably won’t anytime soon.

BYD, which stands for “Build Your Dreams,” is essentially banned from American roads by tariffs imposed to protect U.S. automakers that double the price of imported Chinese plug-ins. Erecting tariff walls may buy the domestic auto industry some time, but it ultimately won't insulate American manufacturers from BYD or the bigger threat that it represents.

The company embodies a Chinese industrial model that is leaving America in the dust. This model, which combines government financial support, methodical long-term planning and aggressive innovation, has already enabled China to achieve global dominance in a range of high-tech industries, from batteries to robotics to drones. Losing those markets to Chinese companies was bad enough. If the same happens in auto manufacturing, the impact would be far worse for America, due to the industry’s size and its economic, political and strategic importance.

The success of BYD and several other upstart Chinese car brands should be a warning for U.S. auto manufacturing and our industrial sector as a whole. We need the courage to recognize how badly we are falling behind, shake off complacency and adopt an urgent government-led effort — think of a “Manhattan Project,” but for cars — to restore U.S. competitiveness.

When I opened my automotive business in Beijing in 1992, cars produced by China’s then-fledgling auto industry were terrible. Shoddily designed and made from cheap materials, they were quick to break down, befitting the country’s reputation at the time as a factory for inferior knockoffs. BYD, a battery manufacturer that began making cars in 2003, was no exception. For years, its cars were notorious in China as clunkers.

Those days are long gone. I’ve driven nearly every BYD model and they are now as good as other top brands like Tesla in terms of design, features, advanced technologies and overall quality. The company’s Blade Battery is among the safest and most cost-efficient in the world, so good that Toyota and Tesla have used it in some of their cars. Most worrying for its competitors, BYDs are affordable: Its least expensive models sell in China for under $10,000, a third of the price of the most affordable electric vehicles available in the U.S. market.

How did BYD pull this off? “Government subsidies!” Western critics will cry, and that’s of course part of the story. Chinese automakers such as BYD are believed to have received billions of dollars worth of state support over the years. This is state capitalism at work. Americans can complain about it all they want, but China isn’t going to scrap this model just because we don’t like it.

BYD is also rapidly innovating. Earlier this year it unveiled an autonomous driving system that may be as good as Tesla’s, if not better, as well as technology that BYD says can charge cars in just five minutes — as quickly as filling a gas tank. Its top-end models include the YangWang U8, a luxury S.U.V. that can rotate 360 degrees in place and operate in water like a boat over short distances.

There’s an argument to be made that we should just let BYD into the U.S. market. It would give American consumers more bang for their buck and U.S. manufacturers a chance to learn from the company.

But BYD now has such overwhelming advantages in costs and battery technologies that it could end up destroying its U.S. competitors, endangering a critical American industry and hundreds of thousands of jobs. This is why Ford’s C.E.O., Jim Farley, last year called Chinese electric vehicles an existential threat and why Elon Musk said they will “demolish” the competition without trade barriers.

We can coddle American companies with tariffs, but it won’t change the fact that we are losing badly. China is far and away the world’s largest producer and exporter of all types of cars, including electrics. They may be shut out of the United States, but BYD and its Chinese peers are seizing control of the fast-growing global E.V. industry. Unable to compete abroad, U.S. automakers will have to retreat into the narrow space where they remain strong: the domestic U.S. market for gas-guzzling trucks and S.U.V.s.

America must take a page from China’s playbook. Ten years ago, Chinese leaders created a blueprint for domination of next-generation technologies, funneling huge sums of money into the project, knowing it would take years to pay off. BYD is just one of many examples of how this is now bearing fruit. Following China’s lead, with its heavy state involvement, would be a tough sell to many in Washington. But America has never confronted an industrial competitor like China.

And this isn’t only about electric vehicles. A strong auto sector has important implications for national defense. Technologies developed by the automotive industry such as batteries, sensors and motors are often later adapted for use in military equipment.

China’s control of supply chains for batteries and rare earth minerals used in electric vehicles is also a potential national security threat, one that we glimpsed recently when Beijing retaliated against U.S. trade tariffs by halting exports of rare earths and the magnets made from them.

Led by its national champion BYD, China has overtaken Detroit as the center of the global auto industry. America can embark on an all-out push to rebuild world-class manufacturing and supply chains, or our carmakers can hide behind tariffs, continue making gas-powered trucks and S.U.V.s and fade into irrelevance.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/09/multimedia/08dunne-wmjg/08dunne-wmjg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 02:01:43.396591

The Biden-era ban was a victory for health advocates who had long fought to prohibit the carcinogenic mineral in all its forms. Last month the Trump administration said it planned to reconsider the asbestos ban, which would have delayed its implementation by several years.

But late Monday, it withdrew that filing.

“The agency has further reconsidered,” the E.P.A. said in the filing in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and would no longer rework the asbestos ban. The filing is part of a court case brought by the industry challenging the restrictions.

Chrysotile asbestos, known as “white asbestos,” is banned in more than 50 countries for its link to lung cancer and mesothelioma, a cancer that forms in the linings of internal organs. White asbestos, however, has been imported for use in the United States for roofing materials, textiles and cement. It is also used in gaskets, clutches, brake pads and other automotive parts, as well as in chlorine manufacturing.

The Environmental Protection Agency, under President Joseph R. Biden, adopted a ban in 2024 on the use, manufacture and import of chrysotile asbestos. It was the first legal constraint on the deadly substance since 2016, when Congress updated and strengthened the Toxic Substances Control Act by requiring testing and regulation of thousands of chemicals used in everyday products.

When the administration said last month it would review the asbestos ban, it drew criticism from Democrats as well as health advocates. In a Facebook post, Hillary Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state and 2016 Democratic nominee for president, wrote, “What is this — Make Asbestos Great Again?”

The Trump administration had said, among other things, that it intended to consider whether the ban “went beyond what is necessary to eliminate the unreasonable risk” for workers using asbestos-containing sheet gaskets in chemical production.

The American Chemistry Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In a statement, the E.P.A. said it still disagreed with aspects of the Biden-era policy but had considered the time that a new rule-making process would require. The E.P.A. will now instead “take immediate action” to further strengthen protections for workers, it said in a statement.

The Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, an advocacy group that works on preventing asbestos exposure, welcomed the reversal. The federal government’s original move to reconsider the ban “would have opened the door to years of delay, confusion and increased risk to public health,” said Linda Reinstein, the group’s president.

Asbestos, a group of six naturally occurring fibrous minerals that have the ability to resist heat, fire and electricity, is linked to an estimated 40,000 deaths annually in the United States. It was first used in construction in the 1930s and was commonly used as an insulator in schools, hospitals, homes and offices as well as in consumer products.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/07/multimedia/07CLI-ASBESTOS-BAN-cwbm/07CLI-ASBESTOS-BAN-cwbm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 01:02:07.271703

And you guessed it—the experts think it was an extreme flash flood.","Texas Energy.

Texas is a state where things are big. I recall an oil and gas professional say that Houston was the friendliest large city in the world. Houston has been called the oil capital of the world, for good reason. Costs of doing business, and regulations, are lower in the state than in most other states of the union.

More than that, Texas is blessed with oil and gas, resources that are well correlated with economic position the world over. Oil and gas are cheap and reliable and over the past 100 years have lifted the economic status of populations.

Several years ago, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) announced that the Delaware basin, a part of the Permian basin, contained the largest continuous resources of oil and gas they had ever measured.

It proved to be true as crude oil production ramped up from 2009 until its peak now of almost 7 MMbopd (million barrels of oil per day). A smaller part of this, 2 MMbopd, underlies New Mexico. The Permian is the premier basin for crude oil in the U.S. and one of the best in the world. As a result, in the United States Texas is number 1 producer of crude oil while New Mexico is number 2. The mighty Permian produces about half of total crude oil, and about a third of total U.S. gas.

Staying with energy, Texas installed a robust system of wind farms, under the supervision of then-governor Rick Perry, in the period 2000 - 2014. If it were a country, the state was ranked as fifth largest generator of wind power in the world. At 28% of U.S. total, Texas produces more wind energy than any other state in the U.S.

Texas Flood.

This evening, almost 100 people are confirmed dead, and many others still missing, after massive flooding in central Texas. Many of these were camping close to the banks of the Guadalupe River, a beautiful river that people escape from summer’s heat by floating on rafts or inflatable tubes.

Floods are not uncommon in central Texas. And the deadly disaster of July 4, Independence Day, became the latest and perhaps the worst. The flash flood alley extends from the border of Oklahoma north of Dallas to San Antonio in the south, and is reminiscent of the infamous tornado alley, an extended pattern of deadly tornadoes that extends from Kansas south to Oklahoma.

There are reasons for the flood alley in Texas: the hill country is elevated by several hundred feet above sea level, which forces out water from humid clouds blowing in from the Gulf of Mexico. The region consists of hills that induce rainfall and valleys that concentrate the runoff into rivers like the Guadalupe. What makes things worse is that the surface soil layer is thin and washes away rather than soaking up the rain.

The flash flood alley implies lots of previous floodings in the area. To give a wider perspective, Texas has the worst flood heritage in the U.S., if this is defined in terms of discharge per rainfall area. To be clear, this is not the whole of Texas, but the local region of the flash flood alley, which has the worst flooding history, not only for Texas, but also for the entire Unites States.

One meteorologist said that four large-scale flooding events have occurred in the last 50 years in flash flood alley, and one in 1987 caused the death of 10 campers at a nearby Christian camp.

Are The Flood And Energy Connected?

Sadly, there are many emotionally-driven outbursts on social media that claim that emissions from the oil and gas industry cause global warming, and this worsens extreme weather events, such as intense floodings. The first claim is true: the oil and gas industry contributes about 50% of greenhouse gas emissions, and these emissions cause global warming, which has risen by about 1 C degree in the last 40-50 years.

But the second claim is false, and the data confirms this. On a global basis, the four killer weather extreme events (droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, floodings) have not worsened in the past 50 years. Any one of these killer extreme events cannot be blamed on global warming.

Further, the IPCC arm of the United Nations concluded the following about U.S. river floods: “There is limited evidence and low agreement on observed climate change influences for river floods in North America. Based on the peer-reviewed literature and observational records, there is little empirical basis to claim that extreme precipitation has increased in “flash flood alley” (or indeed, most of North America or the world). Similarly, there is little basis for claims that flooding has become more common or severe.”

One curious coincidence: the BBC presented in just the past few weeks a dinosaur documentary that talks about a vast herd of a species called Pachyrhinosaurus that are migrating together. These slow-moving creatures were lumbering along a river valley in Canada when they expired 72 million years ago. Archeologists have uncovered hundreds, probably thousands, of dinosaur bones packed together in death. Apparently, all the creatures were destroyed together by some immense destructive force. And you guessed it—the experts think it was an extreme flash flood.

The flood has been a terrible disaster in Texas. Our thoughts go out to the many families who have lost loved ones, and the remarkable efforts of first-responders who have done their best in rescue efforts. If there’s one lesson to take away, it’s the need for Texas to use its technology might to design better warning systems, such as tornado sirens, for flash floods.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/686c8b30b8fcb5b175aae3e3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-08 01:02:17.987217

— Austin Terry, CEO Power LNG

PLANO, TX, UNITED STATES, July 7, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- United Energy LNG and Power LNG announced today the signing of a strategic merger that will create a scalable small-scale LNG platform serving industrial, power, and transport markets across North America.

The combined entity, operating under United Energy LNG (UE LNG), immediately oversees a portfolio of three LNG production sites in advanced stages of development. UE LNG is announcing the commencement of Front-End Loading Phase 1 (FEL-1) at its first project site in Houston, Texas, with a second confidential site underway. A third site in Independence, Kansas is scheduled to begin FEL-1 later this month. With geographic diversity and early-stage capacity, UE LNG aims to expand LNG access for high-demand domestic users. “While the majors are focused on megaprojects, we’re deploying modular, nimble solutions that get LNG to the people and industries who need it now.” said Brian Guinn, Chief Executive Officer of United Energy LNG.

Modular LNG for Distributed Markets

Unlike traditional LNG developments requiring multi-billion-dollar investments and long permitting timelines, United Energy LNG is focused on scalable, regionally targeted solutions:

 Small-scale liquefaction units designed for local and regional demand

 Modular deployment to reduce lead times and capital intensity

 Focused on inland, onshore, and distributed energy applications

 Virtual pipeline logistics to bypass pipeline constraints

This approach enables faster project execution and cost-effective access to clean fuels

for underserved markets.

Addressing Gaps in the U.S. LNG Infrastructure Landscape

Despite global LNG investment nearing $200 billion annually, small-scale LNG remains the least crowded, most overlooked frontier in U.S. energy. Major players focus on export, while decentralized markets remain stranded. That gap is UE LNG’s advantage.

“This merger represents the alignment of speed, innovation, and execution,” said Austin Terry, CEO of Power LNG. “By combining our development and operational expertise with United Energy’s capital platform, we’re unlocking a scalable model for delivering LNG where it’s needed most.”

Inside the Transaction

The merger combines United Energy’s upstream operating experience and public market presence with Power LNG’s permitting progress, engineering capabilities, and pipeline of modular projects. Key metrics include:

 3 Active Development Sites across Texas, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast

 Targeted Liquefaction Capacity of up to 540,000 MTPA at full deployment

 Estimated Capital Investment: $240–270 million across three facilities

 Cash flow projections targeting breakeven within 12–18 months post-commissioning

 Engineering, procurement, and strategic project management partnerships

 Public market access via United Energy LNG’s parent company (OTCMKTS:

UNRG)

Distributed LNG for Energy Transition Applications - UE LNG’s modular platform is being developed to serve:

 Remote and underserved power generation sites

 Heavy-duty transportation and marine fueling networks

 Critical infrastructure requiring fuel resilience

 Industrial operations seeking lower-emission alternatives to diesel and propane

Outlook and Commercial Pathway

United Energy LNG plans to reach financial close on its first three facilities by Q1 2026, with commissioning expected by Q1 2027. The company is actively engaging with feedgas suppliers, utilities, and logistics providers to build out a nationwide virtual LNG delivery network. The company estimates that its addressable domestic market exceeds 2 billion cubic feet equivalent annually, representing a $3+ billion opportunity in underserved power, transport, and industrial sectors. “This is just the beginning,” said Guinn. “By 2028, we aim to operate a network of scalable LNG hubs serving a portfolio of contracted customers across the U.S., turning America’s natural gas into clean, distributed power for everyone.”

A new analysis from Princeton University warns that the sweeping legislation will drive up energy costs for the average American household and reduce grid capacity at a time of rising demand. According to Princeton’s ZERO Lab (short for “Zero-carbon Energy systems Research and Optimization Laboratory”), the new law “repeals nearly all of the tax credits enacted by the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] to support clean electricity, fuels, vehicles and manufacturing.” It also rescinds unspent funding for clean energy and climate programs initially outlined in the IRA of 2022 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) of 2021.

One of the key impacts outlined by the ZERO Lab is a projected increase in U.S. household energy costs: by 2030, the average household could pay roughly $165 more per year, representing a 7.5 percent hike. By 2035, that number is expected to climb to $280 annually, or a 13 percent increase.

These higher costs stem from a sharp drop in capital investment in clean fuels, which is estimated to fall by $500 billion through 2035, and a corresponding decline in power generation and grid capacity. The report warns that by 2035, the act will slash clean electricity generation by over 820 terawatt-hours—more than the entire output of either coal or nuclear power in the U.S. today.

The “Big Beautiful Bill” includes a long list of tax credit repeals and funding cuts that affect individuals, businesses, and the broader energy industry. These include, but are not limited to:

Clean hydrogen production credit

Clean electricity production and investment credits

Clean Air Act funding (amended in 1990)

Personal and commercial clean vehicle credit

Residential clean energy credit

Low-carbon transportation materials grants

Environmental and climate data collection funding

Greenhouse gas corporate reporting funding

According to the Clean Air Council, Philadelphia’s oldest environmental nonprofit founded in 1967, the “Big Beautiful Bill” will “kneecap our growing clean energy sector, raise energy costs, eliminate roughly 770,000 jobs by 2030, and dramatically increase pollution at a time when energy demand and the cost of living are on the rise.”

Before Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement at the start of his second term, the country had aimed to reduce emissions by 40 percent by 2030. Now, with the new law, that target has collapsed. A new climate impact analysis from U.K.-based publication Carbon Brief projects just a 3 percent reduction in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, China is racing ahead. “China wants to be the world’s first electro-state,” said Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton engineering professor, in an X post. He noted that the country now attracts about 75 percent of all global investment in clean tech manufacturing.

“While the bill removes the proposed excise tax on solar projects, a win for the industry, the overall package delivers a severe blow to America’s energy future,” Chris Hopper, CEO and co-founder of Aurora Solar, a solar energy software company, told Observer.

Hopper warned that the legislation “will make energy more expensive for everyone, and more than that, it will most likely create an energy shortage at a time when electricity demand is rising.” One major driver of that demand is A.I. As A.I. adoption accelerates, so does the construction of energy-hungry data centers powering the technology.

“Solar is one of the quickest ways to add capacity to the grid, and if we think fossil gas and nuclear alone can fill that demand, we’re going to be waiting for years—seriously limiting our potential to lead in A.I. and other critical technologies,” said Hopper.",https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/GettyImages-2223448278.jpg?quality=80,N,,2025-07-08 05:01:35.909349

It’s at least the third such suit the city and county has joined, after suing President Donald Trump’s administration for withholding grants from both the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The EPA Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in question was authorized by Congress as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The program was given $3 billion to fund initiatives such as air quality monitoring, natural disaster preparedness, flood and stormwater protection, and other initiatives related to pollution reduction.

Local governments, nonprofit organizations, tribes, and higher education institutions were eligible for the grants. The Treasure Island Mobility Management Agency, a city agency planning and building transportation infrastructure on Treasure Island, is also a plaintiff in the suit, along with 22 other named plaintiffs from across the nation.

The case is called Appalachian Voices, et al. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency et al. and was filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit is seeking grants to resume being transmitted to all 350 recipients who have been awarded funds from the Climate Justice program.

“Climate change is an existential threat to humanity that cannot be ignored, and this funding is critical to help our communities address serious environmental issues,” Chiu said in a statement on Thursday. “…Once again, Trump is attempting to illegally terminate funding to promote his anti-environmental policies — all at the expense of our communities and our climate.”

Some of the initiatives funded by the grant program include lead pipe replacement, tree planting in urban heat zones, installing pollution notification systems, and investing in projects to enhance climate resiliency against extreme weather events, according to the civil complaint.

San Francisco’s grant was for $1 million over a three-year period. The Treasure Island Mobility Management Agency (TIMMA) was awarded a much larger grant of $20 million by the EPA in November that was earmarked for six transportation projects.

“By joining this lawsuit, we’re working to ensure that our communities continue to benefit from federal support that advances climate goals and invests in a healthier, more connected future.”

San Francisco Supervisor Matt Dorsey

San Francisco Supervisor Matt Dorsey, who is also the chair of the Treasure Island Mobility Management Agency, said the program was funding a free shuttle on the island and a bikeshare program.

“By joining this lawsuit, we’re working to ensure that our communities continue to benefit from federal support that advances climate goals and invests in a healthier, more connected future,” Dorsey said in a statement.

As with the other suits the city has filed challenging the withholding of previously authorized federal dollars, the new lawsuit claimed the Trump administration is violating the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers doctrine, which stipulates that Congress controls spending.

It also asserted the grants’ cancellation was a violation of the Administrative Procedures Act, which limits how federal agencies can make rules, and it cited the Constitution’s Presentment Clause, which gives the president authority to veto a bill passed by Congress, but not the power to change law once it is signed.",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/LNM-20241220-BAYFCTREASURE-02.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-08 01:02:10.421592

The recently passed Republican megabill ends the tax credits for wind and solar tax credits unless solar or wind farms start producing electricity by 2028 – or unless they start construction in the next year.

Trump’s executive order tells his administration to limit which projects can count as having started construction.

Specifically, he directs the Treasury Department to restrict “the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

It also says the department should try to prevent “the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility.”

Trump also directed the Interior Department, which manages energy production on federal lands and waters, to look for and eliminate any policies that give “preferential treatment” to wind and solar.

The Republican bill dramatically diminishes the solar and wind incentives passed by Democrats in their 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

But, just how far to go was a major point of contention within the GOP, with more conservative members lamenting that the Senate’s version of the bill – which ultimately also passed the House late last week – was too lenient.

—

Torrential rains associated with a deadly flood that claimed over 100 lives across six counties in central Texas on Independence Day were intensified by human-made climate change, a new study has concluded.

The disaster unfolded rapidly on Friday, as exceptional downpours in Texas Hill Country increased the water level of the Guadalupe River by 26 feet (8 meters) within 45 minutes, bursting its banks and destroying everything in its path. Over 10 inches (254 mm) of rain fell across the region in just a few hours.

The study was conducted by ClimaMeter, a rapid framework for understanding extreme weather events in a changing climate funded by the European Union and the French National Centre for Scientific Research. By comparing past (1950-1986) and present (1987-2023) weather patterns in the region, researchers concluded that natural variability alone cannot explain the catastrophic floods and pointed at climate change as one of the main drivers of the event.

Specifically, they found that temperatures have increased up to 1.5C southern to the flood-affected area, while present-day conditions are up to 2 mm/day – or up to 7% – wetter in parts of central Texas and especially along the corridor from San Antonio to Austin. These changes, the study said, have created an environment more favorable to sudden, high-impact rainfall events.

Researchers also acknowledged that factors not taken into account for this study, such as land use change, urban sprawl, and warning system failutres, may have amplified the floods.

“The devastating floods in Texas reflect the growing impact of a warmer, more humid atmosphere fueled by climate change,” said Mireia Ginesta from the University of Oxford. “To protect communities now, it is essential to maintain strong support for weather forecasting and scientific research, ensuring accurate forecasts and effective early warnings that can save lives.”

The findings align with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s conclusions that climate change is intensifying the water cycle, leading to more intense rainfall and associated flooding.

A warmer atmosphere, heated by fossil fuel emissions, can hold more moisture, resulting in heavier downpours. For every 1C that Earth’s atmospheric temperature rises, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can increase by about 7%.

As climate scientist Andrew Dessler put it: “The role of climate change is like steroids for the weather – it injects an extra dose of intensity into existing weather patterns.”

Participants who completed the Good Jobs Hawaiʻi (GJH) program—a tuition-free, non-credit training program offered through the University of Hawaiʻi Community Colleges—experienced notable increases in earnings and transitions into higher-paying industries six months after completion, according to a preliminary analysis from the UH Economic Research Organization (UHERO).

UHERO said that participants who completed GJH training experienced an average increase of $1,800 in real quarterly wages—equivalent to about $7,200 on an annualized basis—compared to $780 for non-completers.

“These early findings offer encouraging signals,” stated Tim Halliday and Rachel Inafuku in the blog post. “The observed patterns suggest that Good Jobs Hawaiʻi may be associated with increased wages and shifts into higher-paying sectors—factors that align with broader goals of economic mobility. While the current analysis is preliminary, continued investment in data infrastructure will be critical for assessing the program’s long-term influence and understanding which components are most effective.”

Big gains for skilled trades, clean energy, healthcare

Wage gains were particularly significant in the skilled trades and clean energy sectors, where completers earned 35% more than non-completers. In healthcare, completers earned 19% more six months post-completion, rising to 23% more by the fourth quarter.

Geographic differences emerged, with UH Maui College participants seeing the highest post-program earnings growth at 22%.

The data also revealed shifts in employment sectors. Many completers left lower-wage industries, such as food service, and entered fields such as healthcare, construction and public administration. Participants who switched industries after completing training saw significantly higher wage gains than those who remained in the same field.

Disparities remain

While short-term gains were promising, disparities remained. Women, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander participants earned less than their peers. And those with a high school diploma or less saw the largest average increase—about $2,000 more per quarter than their pre-program earnings.

The authors note their analysis reflects a relatively new program with a small sample size—fewer than 2,000 individuals—and a short follow-up period of typically two quarters after completion. As a result, it does not capture longer-term earnings trends.

However, they said, “As the initiative progresses, programs like Good Jobs Hawaiʻi have the potential to strengthen Hawaiʻi’s economic resilience by creating pathways for residents to access higher-paying jobs.”

""The executed agreements will allow Fermi America to acquire highly reliable, energy-efficient, and environmentally advanced power generation systems to support the artificial intelligence campus,"" added Fermi America Chief Power Procurement Officer, Larry Kellerman.
Fermi America hopes to build the first of the nuclear power installations by 2032.","Off-grid power may be the only way to expediently deal with a looming data center energy crunch, according to many leaders at high levels of government, private equity and power generation. Co-located units can bypass long interconnection and regulatory delays to meet the demand sooner.

In one case, a startup co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry is partnering with Texas Tech University on ambitious plans to build an $11 billion connected natural gas and artificial intelligence (AI) data center campus in Amarillo.

Fermi America is touting its plan of an “Amarillo HyperGrid” as the next generation in on-site power development to meet growing AI and cloud-based data center demand. The first phase will bring in six Siemens Energy SGT800 gas-fired turbines and one SST600 steam turbine to deliver about 478 MW of co-located power for the AI campus in the Texas Panhandle.

The project developers have a longer vision incorporating co-located nuclear energy for the complex.

Fermi America was co-founded by a team that includes American private equity investor Toby Neugebauer and Perry, who was the energy secretary in President Donald’s Trump first administration and Texas governor from 2000 to 2015. The company is named after Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, who played a significant role in the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear power.

Neugebauer has been a significant political donor to Republicans such as Perry and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz in the past.

Although gas-fired power is the initial behind-the-meter power solution for the planned Amarillo HyperGrid, Fermi America also will seek federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval to build utility-scale reactor plants alongside the Amarillo AI site.

Many in the U.S., such as Neugebauer and Perry, contend that AI is a national security issue and off-grid power is the best way to fuel those heavy loads. Nuclear power also operates at consistently high-capacity factors and does not generate carbon emissions.

Behind-the-meter power is the only solution to ensure “America’s AI dominance,” Neugebauer said in a statement. “Without it, we're handing China the keys to AI. There will only be one winner.""

In the meantime, the project’s first gas-fired installation also will utilize selective catalytic reduction to reduce total emissions from the combined-cycle turbine power generation, according to the Fermi America statement. The company’s second power-unit acquisition, which closed last month, will add a set of three secondary market General Electric industrial gas turbines and a paired steam turbine which previously operated to provide power for an industrial customer in New Jersey.

All of those previously used GE units will be refurbished and made operative in simple cycle mode.

""The executed agreements will allow Fermi America to acquire highly reliable, energy-efficient, and environmentally advanced power generation systems to support the artificial intelligence campus,"" added Fermi America Chief Power Procurement Officer, Larry Kellerman. ""The initial fleet represents ISO rated capability of over 600 MW of power generation equipment that is available for shipment and refurbishment, avoiding multi-year Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) lead times.""

Utility-scale nuclear power plants currently generate about 18% of total U.S. electricity, but building new plants is time consuming and hugely expensive. Southern Co.’s Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 reactor expansion projects, while now delivering the single biggest carbon-free generation nationwide, took about a decade and cost close to $35 billion to add the two units.

Next-generation combined cycle gas-fired power installation as a starter would be cheaper and quicker to build while also contributing less CO2 emissions compared with current coal and gas generation, the company says. Fermi America hopes to build the first of the nuclear power installations by 2032.

West Texas also is home to the Permian Basin oil and gas play which is the most prolific in the U.S.

Details on the partnership with Texas Tech University are not clear yet, nor what kind of financial backing the company has beyond its associations with Neugebauer and Perry.

And while Fermi America is seeking federal nuclear regulatory approval, its appeal is first to the Trump Administration, which is seen by many as seeking to pull oversight power away from the NRC and place it within the White House, according to some reports.

The Trump-led U.S. Department of Energy has announced plans to streamline advanced reactor project development and reduce the lengthy review processes of the NRC.

A battery passport serves as an Aadhaar identity of sorts, with every battery having a unique ID that provides all information on the product

NEW DELHI: In a move that will help owners of electric vehicles (EVs) get precise details of the batteries being used, India will soon have its own ""Battery Passport"" regime. Under the system, the specifications of every battery, including its origin, performance, composition, end of life and the entire supply cycle will be captured digitally and embedded in a QR code.Niti Aayog has started deliberations with ministries and govt departments on the proposed framework, sources said. Officials highlighted that a battery passport serves as an Aadhaar identity of sorts, with every battery having a unique ID that provides all information on the product. The initiative will not only improve safety and quality standards but also accelerate export of EVs from India. Significantly, India is offering incentives to global EV players to set up plants and export their vehicles from India. It will also be crucial when govt rolls out a battery swapping policy for vehicles, allowing owners to access details of batteries by scanning the QR code printed on them. The need for such a regime was first felt after a series of fire incidents involving electric two-wheelers and cars. Industry insiders said there had been instances of companies importing battery cells of different vintages and using them as part of the same modules. ""When cells made in different years are joined together, there is more load on new cells, as the older ones are closer to their expiry date. Such a module impacts performance and can be a safety hazard,"" said a source. Officials privy to govt's plan said once the battery passport system is implemented, it will be possible to ensure that cells in any battery are manufactured in the same year. Through it, users will get to know about the lifecycle and performance of batteries, which is key considering they account for nearly 40% of the costs of EVs, an official said. A source said, ""This move will help achieve three major goals: trade (export of electric vehicles), safety and quality"". The European Union in 2023 enacted the Battery Regulation making it mandatory for every industrial or EV battery in EU with a capacity of over 2 kWh to have a battery passport. It will come into force on Feb 1, 2027. The battery passports will require inputs from mining and refining companies, cell and battery producers, vehicle brands, and battery servicing, refurbishing, and recycling companies. The EU rules specify that the battery passport must contain all information, including unique identifier, basic characteristics of the battery including type and model, updated statistics on performance and durability, and carbon footprint specific to the manufacturing site and batch of batteries. This information will need to be selectively shared with three groups: the general public, regulatory bodies, and battery service and end-of-life processors.

3.1 In its first two years, the Just Transition Fund supported a wide range of projects across the North East and Moray, spanning early-stage feasibility studies, skills programmes, nature-based initiatives, and capital infrastructure. Projects were delivered by a mix of start-ups, social enterprises, academic institutions, and public bodies. Projects were given freedom to decide which economic, community, environmental or equity outcomes they would deliver against. Many were pre-commercial or exploratory in nature, meaning tangible impacts—such as job creation or emissions savings—are emerging but not yet fully realised.

3.2 In this chapter we describe in more detail the economic, community, social and environmental impact of the projects funded by the JTF. As well as capturing successes and project achievements, this chapter also explores the implementation and project delivery challenges.

Economic impact

Total jobs created: at least 110 jobs.

Total jobs safeguarded: 120 jobs.

Total number of people who accessed training: at least 750.

Private sector investment in JTF projects: £30 million.

Public/third sector investment in JTF projects: £4.7 million

Employment

3.3 At least 110 jobs have been created across the 24 JTF projects, with the largest contributions from the Social Enterprise Just Transition Fund (47 jobs) and the ETZ Supply Chain and Energy Transition Challenge (37 jobs). While these figures provide a strong indication of job creation, additionality and displacement effects have not been formally considered, meaning it is unclear whether all jobs are entirely new to the region or if they have replaced existing roles elsewhere.

The 47 new jobs created by the Social Enterprise Just Transition Fund are all new full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs including positions in green skills training and community-led business development;

ETZ’s Supply Chain and Energy Transition Challenge Fund has supported 37 new jobs in sectors such as offshore wind, hydrogen, fabrication, and energy transition supply chains;

The Findhorn Watershed Initiative created a mix of full-time and contract-based roles, employing 5.45 FTE staff and supporting work across ecology, mapping, and woodland restoration; and

North East Adventure Tourism (NEAT) has begun hiring for permanent and seasonal roles, with Huntly Development Trust, a sub-project under NEAT, appointing a full-time centre manager and Tarland Trails, another sub-project of NEAT’s, planning to recruit trail maintenance staff.

3.4 Several projects have laid the foundation for future workforce expansion by creating employment opportunities in emerging sectors. In the academic and innovation sectors, projects such as UHI Moray Net Zero Bottlenecks and the Digital Innovation Lab have facilitated employment in research, green skills, and decarbonisation initiatives. The Digital Innovation Lab, for example, employed four staff within the University, all dedicated to climate-related projects. Additionally, several projects, including Ripcell’s EV Battery Recycling initiative, have begun with a small number of staff including four green jobs.

3.5 In addition to job creation, the JTF has helped safeguard 120 existing roles. The ETZ Supply Chain and Energy Transition Challenge safeguarded 96 jobs in 2023/24, with further job retention expected in future years; the Social Enterprise Just Transition Fund protected 24 FTE jobs, particularly in social enterprises focused on green skills and community development. Other projects contributed to workforce transition and job security. The Findhorn Watershed Initiative supported land management workers in adapting their skills toward nature restoration.

Future jobs

3.6 Several JTF-funded projects anticipate creating additional jobs in the coming years, particularly as they scale operations, secure further investment, or transition from planning to implementation:

ETZ Supply Chain Pathway and Energy Transition Challenge Fund forecasts 200 new green jobs over four years;

EV Battery Recycling expects to expand from four jobs to up to 12 as operations scale;

Hydroglen and Hydrogen Offshore Production (HOP2) highlight potential for long-term employment in renewable energy, contingent on further infrastructure development and funding; and

Cabrach Trust Distillery, a social enterprise, will bring single malt whisky production back to the area, creating jobs and volunteering opportunities, particularly in a region impacted by outward migration.

3.7 These projections remain speculative, as actual job creation will depend on future funding, policy shifts, and market conditions. Many projects, particularly those in research, feasibility studies, and infrastructure, require sustained investment to transition from short-term project roles to lasting employment. As the JTF is a ten-year endeavour still in its early stages, measuring its long-term job impact will require continued tracking of workforce retention.

Through future growth of the Lab and associated projects, it is likely that further green jobs will be created in the University. (Digital Innovation Lab, End of Year Report)

Sectoral distribution of jobs

3.8 JTF-funded jobs span five main sectors: renewable energy, education, social enterprise, sustainable tourism, and research, with additional roles in community engagement and infrastructure development:

Renewable energy: projects such as EV Battery Recycling created technical and engineering roles, while the ETZ Supply Chain & Energy Transition Challenge contributed to employment in energy transition industries;

Education and research: the UHI Moray Net Zero Bottlenecks project created three research fellow roles, while the JT Hub at James Hutton Institute is expected to generate further research jobs. The Digital Innovation Lab also employed four staff dedicated to net-zero research and decarbonisation projects;

Social enterprise: the Social Enterprise Just Transition Fund was a major driver of job creation, supporting employment in social enterprises focused on climate action. The NESCAN Communities Project also created an engagement officer role to support community-led transition initiatives; and

Sustainable tourism: North East Adventure Tourism (NEAT) project created a full-time role, with Huntly Development Trust hiring a centre manager and Tarland Trails planning to recruit maintenance staff.

Training and skills initiatives

3.9 The projects have played a key role in delivering training and skills development across multiple sectors, ensuring individuals and businesses are equipped for the energy transition. These are mainly through three projects:

The Pilot Energy Skills Project developed and delivered 15 new courses, alongside 22 existing ones, providing over 700 free training places across three academic institutions, surpassing their target of 450 training places. These courses ranged from short workshops to 36-week programmes, addressing skills gaps in the energy sector and both supporting new entrants and upskilling workers in the renewable energy sector;

The Energy Skills Passport finished its minimum viable product development and initial workforce testing, aiming to provide a standardised system for skills recognition in offshore energy; and

The ETZ Supply Chain Pathway and Energy Transition Challenge Fund ran workshops, masterclasses, and onboarding sessions for over 300 businesses transitioning to offshore renewables, covering topics like floating wind and digital acceleration.

Continuous development of Transition Extreme enables the social enterprise to engage young people, often furthest from the job market, in the sports offering in the city, train them and offer them employment opportunities at the centre. (NEAT, End of Year Report)

3.10 Other projects contributed to workforce development through specialist training. The ETZ Energy Transition Skills Hub (formerly the Advanced Manufacturing Skills Hub) is a significant investment aimed at expanding skills capacity in the energy transition sector. This includes the development of a new facility at North East Scotland Altens campus in Aberdeen and the procurement of an outreach vehicle to improve accessibility of training opportunities. Alongside this the Digital Innovation Lab trained six individuals as certified drone pilots, while the Findhorn Watershed Initiative provided 44 participants with training in nature restoration, including GIS mapping, biodiversity monitoring, and seedling surveying.

Investment

3.11 In the next section the amount of funding leveraged alongside the JTF’s investment is presented in terms of in-kind contributions, public and charitable trust monies and private sector funds.

3.12 Individual investment decisions for projects receiving JTF funds alongside financial support from other organisations and sectors (private, public and third sector) will have been made against a balance of funds available, perceived investment risk and the potential financial and non-financial benefits associated with each project. The weighting of these factors varied among investment partners for each project making it challenging to precisely quantify the extent to which JTF directly leveraged additional partner funding or whether projects with multiple funders would have proceeded without JTF support. However, the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the JTF has effectively encouraged and facilitated additional investments from private, public and third sector partners. This supplementary funding has enabled project expansion, sustainability, and the development of new initiatives.

In-kind contribution

3.13 Several JTF projects benefited from substantial in-kind contributions, with three reporting figures about the contributions they had received. These contributions helped maximise the impact of JTF funding by supplementing financial support with resources.

3.14 The James Hutton Institute provided £96,216 worth of staff time for the JT Hub, including participation in project team meetings, design consultations, and stakeholder engagement. The Digital Innovation Lab also received in-kind support from Robert Gordon University (RGU), which enabled the establishment of a production lab, procurement of advanced scanning equipment, and sourcing of lidar data valued at over £300,000. Similarly, the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) made a significant in-kind contribution across its network, supporting the UHI Moray Net Zero Bottlenecks project with staffing, administration, and other services.

The University has contributed approximately £560k of in-kind support through the project. This is primarily in relation to staff including digital and computing experts, built environment experts, production assistants to enable significant data interrogation and modelling, business development and commercial experts, and project management support. (Digital Innovation Lab, End of Year Report)

3.15 The Findhorn Watershed Initiative benefited from extensive landowner and estate staff support, including logistical assistance, accommodation, and access to land for ecological surveys. Board members of the Findhorn, Nairn & Lossie Rivers Trust also provided expertise in law, finance, and project coordination, strengthening the initiative’s governance and planning.

3.16 These in-kind contributions played a valuable role in extending the reach of JTF projects, reducing reliance on external funding, and ensuring efficient project delivery.

Additional public sector/third sector/charitable trust investment

3.17 The JT Hub secured £1.6 million from the Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology (DSIT) to develop an immersive engagement space, allowing stakeholders to visualise energy transition scenarios. This investment was directly enabled by initial JTF funding, which provided the foundation for securing further resources.

3.18 In the education and skills sector, the Pilot Energy Skills Project attracted Scottish Funding Council (SFC) funding to develop an Energy Career Pathways Tool, helping individuals navigate opportunities in the energy transition sector. SFC funding also helped address over-demand for course places by covering additional enrolments. ETZ also provided the pilot Energy Skills Project with £27k in additional funding to target the most deprived postcodes in Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen city, which allowed more residents to benefit from the courses being offered.

3.19 Environmental and community-led initiatives have also benefited. The Findhorn Watershed Initiative unlocked multiple public and charitable trust investments totaling £2,170,414 over from inception and over the next five years. This includes:

£197,914 from the naturescot Nature Restoration Fund;

£75,000 from the LNER Community & Customer Investment Fund;

A five-year funding agreement with Chivas Brothers worth up to £1,662,500;

£10,000 contributed by the Moray Climate Action Network; and

Three-year grant from the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation valued at £225,000.

3.20 The UHI Moray Net Zero Bottlenecks obtained £70,000 from the Scottish Government’s Climate Engagement Fund and £2,500 from the Moray Climate Action Network. Additionally, the Energy Skills Partnership provided the UHI Moray Net Zero Bottlenecks project funding to design an online Futures in Wind course, further supporting workforce development in the renewable energy sector.

3.21 Local government has also played a role in supporting JTF-backed initiatives. Aberdeen City Council awarded NESCAN Hub £80,000 to manage a Community Environmental Improvement Fund, alongside an additional £8,000 in coordination fees. The Two Towns Big Ideas Grant from Aberdeenshire Council has also supported community-led projects emerging from NESCAN’s work. Other community and enterprise projects benefited from additional funding streams. The Social Enterprise Just Transition Fund leveraged £1 million in additional funding, doubling its impact, while Huntly Development Trust (under North East Adventure Tourism) secured £273,651 from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF).

3.22 These public, third-sector, and charitable trust investments have significantly amplified the impact of JTF-funded projects, increasing opportunities for skills development, community engagement, and environmental restoration.

Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB)

SNIB is as an independent commercial entity responsible for dispersing public capital into impactful and commercially viable investments. While funded by the Scottish Government (its shareholder), SNIB operates autonomously, akin to a private investment firm, making independent investment decisions aiming for both financial returns and positive societal impacts. The bank particularly addresses market gaps, supporting innovation, technology growth, net-zero transition, and place-based community investment.

The Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB) became involved with the Just Transition Fund (JTF) in its second year to manage the deployment of financial transactions. With a substantial allocation of £25 million for the 2023/2024 financial year, SNIB assumed responsibility for distributing these funds, leveraging its established infrastructure and expertise.

The £25 million allocation was integrated into SNIB’s commercial investment framework but was specifically directed to achieve JTF outcomes supporting Scotland’s transition to net zero. SNIB matched each JTF investment resulting in £24.25 million being deployed across three organisations and these investments attracted a further £20.4 million from private investors.

Aurora Energy £10 million JTF plus £10 million SNIB

Orbex £5.25 million JTF plus £5.25 million SNIB

Trojan Energy £9 million JTF plus £9 million SNIB

Private sector investment

3.23 The JTF has also played a role in attracting private sector investment to supported projects. Many projects used JTF funding as a catalyst to garner private investment, strengthening their financial sustainability and expanding their impact.

3.24 The Supply Chain and Energy Transition Challenge Fund successfully secured £6.2 million in private sector match funding from various companies, significantly amplifying the original JTF investment. Similarly, the Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB) reported that its JTF-supported investments have attracted an additional £20.4 million from private investors, demonstrating the Fund’s role in unlocking private capital. Under Food Hub NES, an additional investment of £1 million came from Opportunity North East (ONE).

3.25 In the renewable energy sector, the EV Battery Recycling project leveraged a £80,000 investment from IBIOIC (Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre). The project aims to become self-sufficient, reducing reliance on public funds while continuing to expand operations. Other projects, like the Energy Skills Hub have secured a commitment of £1.8 million over five years from Shell to support workers to transition into green jobs.

3.26 The Cabrach Distillery project exemplified how JTF funding complemented private sector backing. The initiative secured a total of £2.985 million, with significant contributions from private philanthropy and industry partners, including the Ethos Foundation, Bentley Foundation, Forsyths Ltd., and the William Grant Foundation. This support was instrumental in advancing the distillery’s regeneration and economic development plans.

3.27 Overall, JTF-supported initiatives have leveraged significant private sector funding, demonstrating strong market confidence in certain projects’ potential.

The Just Transition Fund award has enabled further investment beyond the funding period, including sponsorship of a welding academy from the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board (ECITB) and £1.8m investment over 5 years from Shell UK to help 1,000 people into energy transition jobs.

3.28 Across the public, third, charitable sector and the private sector, investment has totalled just over £34 million, with £30 million in private funding and £4.7 million in public/third sector funding.

Financial transactions 2023-2024

Aurora Energy Services - a total investment of £20 million (£10 million from JTF and £10 million matched by SNIB was allocated to expand Aurora’s network of regional training hubs and workshop facilities that support the renewable energy supply chain, covering sectors like wind, solar, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage (CCS), pumped hydro, and waste-to-energy. The strategic goal of Aurora’s funding is to capitalize on existing skills within the oil and gas industry, retraining workers for renewable energy roles, thereby supporting Scotland's net-zero ambitions. The funding accelerates the company’s expansion into renewables, increases employment and training opportunities in rural Scotland.

Orbex - a spaceflight company, received a follow-on investment totalling £10.5 million from SNIB (£5.25 million JTF plus £5.25 million SNIB). This formed part of a larger £16.7 million funding round alongside private investors. Orbex’s investment was used primarily to accelerate the development of its ""Prime"" rocket—a sustainable rocket system designed to transport small satellites into low earth orbit. This rocket uniquely uses renewable bio-fuels to significantly reduce carbon emissions compared to traditional rockets. The funds will also support the completion and expansion of Orbex’s Sutherland Spaceport, underpinning Orbex’s commitment to sustainability and bolstering Scotland's positioning as a leading hub for sustainable space technologies.

Trojan Energy - secured a total of £18 million from SNIB (£9 million JTF matched by £9 million SNIB), part of a broader £26 million funding round, which also involved £8 million from growth capital investor BGF. Trojan Energy provides innovative on-street electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions and the funding supports the deployment of Trojan’s patented flat, pavement-integrated chargers, addressing public charging accessibility for households without driveways. The investment supports Trojan’s growth, expanding public EV charging infrastructure to deploy thousands more chargers throughout the UK.

Community and social impact

Community engagement

At least 1,700 people engaged in community activities.

More than 19,000 people voted on funding decisions for local projects.

Participatory budgeting

97 projects funded across two years (grants from £1,000 to £50,000)

3.29 In this section the wider social and community impacts that have been realised as a direct result of the Fund’s investment are identified. Four projects explicitly described how their activity was contributing towards the empowerment of local communities. Three of these gave evidence of how this had already been achieved (JT Communities Project (NESCAN), Findhorn Watershed Initiative and the JT Participatory Budgeting Fund) and the fourth described how it was expected to be achieved in the future (Hydroglen).

3.30 A wider range of community benefits were also reported, and these provide insight into how the JTF is enabling (or could enable) community empowerment. Reported benefits can be broadly categorised as:

Being heard – enabling communities to take part in decision making and shape a just transition;

Building awareness – raising awareness and understanding of climate change and the actions that can make a difference;

Sense of place – creating or strengthening connections with a place or community; and

Improving local places – creating new facilities or improving/ retrofitting existing facilities that in turn, create spaces for communities to enjoy and come together.

Enabling communities to be heard

3.31 Two of the projects, NESCAN’s Just Transition (JT) Communities project and the JT Participatory Budgeting Fund, were directly focused on engaging communities as part of a just transition to net zero. These projects created opportunities for local people to shape what the transition meant and looked like in their area.

3.32 The JT Communities project gave communities access to information and resources so that they could develop their understanding of the transition and created structures and processes to help them organise their response to it. This included the piloting of community climate assemblies as well as what the project described as deliberative processes. The supported communities are developing their own Just Transition Community Actions plans which will set out their priorities for the future. In their End-of-Year 2023/2024 report, the project stated that:

587 people, including 105 young people and 36 communities of interest groups had been engaged through this work;

The funded activity had led to strengthened links with other policy and decision-making structures including local authorities, community councils and Scotland’s Just Transition Commission; and

That the project has developed a model for the transition that is: community-led, rooted in residents’ lived experience and harnesses the Place Principle in identifying local JT priorities and actions on adaptation and mitigation, and which also should inform the regional policy and planning framework.

3.33 The Just Transition Participatory Budgeting (JTPB) Fund is also enabling communities to take part in decision making. To date, there have been three funding rounds (one in each year since the programme’s launch in 2022) with an ongoing £1 million annual commitment with grants of £1,000 to £50,000 available to community groups. The initiative has supported a wide variety of projects, including allotments, electric vehicle (EV) minibuses for community transport, retrofitting community spaces for energy efficiency, and the creation of new green spaces.

3.34 A total of 44 projects were funded in Year 1 and 53 in Year 2. Participatory democracy is central to the JTPB process, ensuring that funding decisions are directly shaped by the communities they impact. Each year, the JTF is split across three regions—Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, and Moray—where a shortlist of eligible projects is identified before being put forward for a public vote. Members of the public are then invited to vote on which projects should receive funding, allowing communities to have a direct say in how the just transition takes shape in their area. These votes are conducted throughout the North East, with a total of 19,094 voters consulted: 7,723 in Aberdeen City, 8,428 in Aberdeenshire, and 2,943 in Moray. The JTPB was delivered through a partnership of five organisations and one of these partners suggested that the participatory approach used had enabled a wider audience to engage in the just transition and better understand what it meant in everyday life.

It's helping more people to contribute and volunteer, the communities that have got involved are not just the ones that have green on the tin. (JTPB Partner)

3.35 Some of the partners also described how the benefits of the project go beyond the participatory processes, with the locally funded projects making the just transition more visible in local communities by demonstrating what it could look like. In doing so, it helped people to think about the process in a way they might not have done otherwise. The funded projects also showed what could be achieved through collective action:

Beyond the tangible outputs, the project instilled confidence in communities, showing them that small local actions collectively lead to larger change. This kind of behavioural shift around decarbonization and efficiencies is one of the most meaningful outcomes of the initiative. (JT Participatory Budgeting Partner Interview)

Awareness raising

3.36 Some of the projects sought to raise awareness of climate change and the actions that can be taken to help bring about a transition. For example, several of the projects worked with local schools including:

Ripcell’s EV Battery Recycling project to raise awareness of recycling;

VSA Easter Anguston Farm’s through its farm-to-fork programme, which grew fruit and vegetables in newly installed polytunnels to improve understanding of more sustainable forms of agriculture; and

NESCAN’s JT Communities project carried out extensive work in schools on topics including climate literacy, the circular economy and climate action heroes.

3.37 Other projects that were primarily focused on skills development also reported that their activity helped to raise awareness across communities.

Creating connection with place

3.38 The Findhorn Watershed Initiative aimed to empower communities by creating a connection with the local rivers and ecosystem as part of their restoration programme of work. The different workstreams are described in more detail in the showcase example. The JTF provided the Initiative with the capacity needed to trial different approaches to community engagement. These approaches included ‘research residence’ to explore cultural heritage and human ecology, creative engagement sessions and environmental education. Feedback presented in their 2023/4 End-of-Year report suggests that some of the 1,190 involved had begun to learn about their local environment and develop a stronger connection to it.

Improving places

3.39 The funding has led to investment in new or improved facilities in some communities. For example, NEAT developed the local mountain biking infrastructure and reported that the community is benefiting from this through access to a facility that can improve their health and wellbeing as well as increased visitor numbers/ visitor spend. Elsewhere, VSA Easter Anguston Farm (run by a health and social care charity that support vulnerable adults and children) used some of their funding to install play equipment and the JT Participatory Budgeting fund enabled local groups to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings and create community gardens. JT Participatory Budgeting project partners described how these improvements had created warm spaces for the wider community to use, which in turn was identified by an interviewee as generating more community activity.

Strengthening local economies

3.40 Several projects provided tangible examples of how delivery against the JTF’s Communities and Places outcome had strengthened local economies. The reported examples included:

New play facilities at VSA Easter Anguston Farm and the improved mountain biking infrastructure developed by the NEAT project were both reported to have led to increased visitor numbers;

The NEAT project also described how the project had enabled them to test a new model of funding and support a community to develop their local infrastructure to generate wealth; and

Findhorn Watershed Initiative recognised their potential as a local anchor institution and used the JTF funding to support community wealth building through their procurement processes.

3.41 A greater number of examples were given of how projects are expected to help to create more sustainable communities, and in doing so, strengthen local economies in the future. These included:

The Cabrach Trust is developing a new distillery, which will be operated as a social enterprise and return single malt production to the area. Once completed, it is expected to bring visitors to the area and in doing so create jobs and volunteering opportunities. Creating jobs in the local area was perceived by the project lead as important in tackling outward migration and energising the local community; and

The James Hutton Institution is constructing a ‘Hydroglen’ community farm demonstrator site that is expected to help rural areas better understand their renewable energy potential and connect remote communities and their local economies with the Scottish hydrogen economy. It will address the lack of gas grid connections by using green hydrogen and through the production of green energy. By enabling communities to recognize their potential, the project is expected to empower rural communities in the future.

I suppose there's things that are more intangible when it comes to that. You know, a sense of hopefulness, a sense of the community believing that the area has a future, when there's been such migration of people away from the area to cities to pursue jobs and opportunity elsewhere. You have a business like this, which is looking to do things in the right way by the community in the environment. (Cabrach Distillery, Interview)

Tackling inequalities

3.42 The evaluation found some examples of how the projects’ activities were helping to tackle social and economic inequalities.

Enabling groups and communities to access funding

3.43 Some projects described how they had worked to enable groups and organisations that might not usually be able access to funding or support to benefit from the JTF. Both the JT Participatory Budgeting and Social Enterprise JTF described how their approach to administering the funding was designed to achieve this. The Social Enterprise JTF delivered a series of events to help groups to apply for funding. These included online Preparing for Investment workshops and in-person masterclasses. They also carried out a data mining exercise to identify where social enterprises and third sector organisations were working in areas of deprivation and targeted them in their promotion of the project. It was reported in the End-of-Year 2022/23 report that funded activities had benefited around 160 organisations and 108,000 people across the region.

3.44 The JT Participatory Budgeting was delivered by five partners to enable a broad reach into different communities, and they delivered awareness raising events in each year of the fund. Partners also supported groups to develop their project ideas and prepare a funding application (for example, the End-of-Year Report 2023/24 stated that a project partner provided over 70 hours of one-to-one support in the JT Participatory Budgeting’s second year). While this approach was resource intensive, it was identified as enabling smaller community groups to access funding.

3.45 In Year 2, the JT Participatory Budgeting partners carried out more targeted engagement with local minority groups and adapted the criteria to encourage and support successful applications from minority groups e.g. Aberdeen Mosque. In addition, and to ensure that young people had a greater say, young people in Moray were able to decide how part of the fund was allocated in Year 2.

In Moray, a tenth of the Fund was originally reserved for a participatory budgeting process governed by young people. Of the remaining £450,000, the first £225,000 was open to all, while the remaining £225,000 prioritised groups without paid development staff. (Just Transition Participatory Budgeting, End of Year Report).

3.46 A project partner commented that the JT Participatory Budgeting had made funding access more democratic and enabled smaller organisations to access support. Despite these efforts though, the JT Participatory Budgeting concluded in their 2023/24 End-of-Year report that more work was needed to encourage smaller groups to apply for funding and counteract the perception that PB is a ‘popularity contest.’

Funding groups and communities to tackle inequalities

3.47 The majority of the Social Enterprise JTF and JT Participatory Budget funded groups were working towards increasing inclusion and improving local facilities. For example, the Social Enterprise JTF had funded a charity that was supporting people who were homeless, and the JT Participatory Budgeting had funded the development of a community garden in a deprived area that had limited access to green spaces.

3.48 In addition, the JTF itself directly funded organisations that supported vulnerable community members. The VSA Easter Anguston Farm project, for example, is a working farm and a training facility for adults with learning difficulties. It is being delivered by VSA, a health and social care charity supporting vulnerable people in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. Children and adults from some of the most deprived communities can access the farm. VSA wants the farm to become a hub for sustainable education, food security and health and wellbeing.

Lowering energy costs

3.49 Project partners reported that the increased energy efficiency measures funded through the JT Participatory Budgeting enabled local groups to benefit from lower energy costs, which in turn made these groups more sustainable.

3.50 Future benefits around energy costs are expected to be brought about through NESCAN’s JT Communities project, which supported communities to develop plans to implement retrofitting campaigns and community and shared energy schemes. Similarly, the Digital Innovation Lab used their JTF funding to test a new facility that uses immersive and visualisation technologies to support decision making and planning around, for example, the retrofitting of existing buildings and the design of new buildings and spaces. Supporting energy efficiency improvements in social housing was identified as a potential future use of the lab in the project’s End-of-Year 2023/2024 report.

3.51 Other funded projects described different ways in which they expected their work to tackle inequalities in the future which included:

Reducing fuel poverty: Some of the projects that focused on energy transition cited how they were developing new technology or processes that would enable areas to make better use of renewable energy sources. These projects were perceived to be particularly beneficial to remote and rural areas where access to gas was limited and fuel poverty higher. As well as the Hydroglen project, Shine Engineering’s project explored the use of tidal and river flow energy to create a low-cost energy solution that could also tackle the fuel poverty experienced in remote areas. As a demonstrator site (in construction) and a feasibility study, these benefits have yet to be realised; and

Tackling the root causes of deprivation: As part of a Case for Change and Preliminary Options Appraisal carried out as part of the CNER Buchan Sustainable Transport Study, poor public transport was identified as a key factor in experiences of deprivation in Fraserburgh and Peterhead. The Feasibility Study identified the potential of a new railway for improving access to health, leisure and employment opportunities.

Environmental impact

Carbon reduction

Retrofitting and EV purchases via Social Enterprise JTF & JT PB Fund cut emissions (e.g., 1.82t CO2e/year from evs).

Businesses supported in low-carbon transition

26 businesses (The Supply Chain Pathway and Energy Transition Challenge Fund)

Clean energy innovation

Seaweed Energy’s wave system could offset 1t CO2e per MW.

Ripcell’s battery recycling process is carbon negative (-1.59kg CO2e).

Sustainable construction

Energy Skills Hub and Seedpod built for 100% renewable energy use.

Cabrach Distillery using anaerobic digestion for green gas.

Biodiversity and land restoration

125ha of woodland restoration (Findhorn) to sequester 5,064t CO2e.

Moray Council identified 133ha for planting (~1,341t CO2e/year).

3.52 The projects identified environmental benefits or expected benefits as a result of JTF.

Carbon reduction and sustainability

3.53 Three of the JTF projects have distributed funding to businesses, organisations or community groups to enable action that can reduce emissions. The Social Enterprise JTF and the JT Participatory Budgeting both funded groups to retrofit buildings and purchase electric vehicles. The Social Enterprise JTF cited case study examples of the savings made. For example, the purchase of two electric vehicles enabled an organisation to reduce CO2e by an estimated 1.82.t per annum and another organisation had received funding for a net-zero build that would be net negative by an estimated 0.87t pa.

3.54 Similarly, the JT Participatory Budgeting described how the funding of electric vehicles reduced carbon emissions, and an organisation was using their vehicle to support the circular economy (by distributing preloved clothing). Other PB funded activities included retrofitting buildings and the trialling of battery storage and infra-red heaters and controls in community spaces. These impacts, however, have not been quantified.

3.55 The Supply Chain Pathway and Energy Transition Challenge Fund aimed to support local businesses to transition to low carbon markets. The project reported in their survey response that 11 businesses received Challenge Fund monies in 2022/23 and 15 in 2023/24 (totalling £3.1m). While the funded activities were known to have reduced emissions, the reductions made were not always quantified by recipient businesses. Examples of how reductions were being achieved included the development of in-house capabilities for activities that had previously been outsourced and through the purchase of equipment that enabled the automation of processes. While it is too early to draw conclusions about the impact of the funding, the project described how its first two years of delivery have created a cohort of 26 businesses who are now actively engaged in using renewable energy.

3.56 Other projects have also developed and tested new technology and processes that could potentially support the transition to net-zero:

Seaweed Energy’s JTF project enabled them to complete a design scope of their wave energy technology system. It was calculated that the generation of one megawatt of power using their new system could offset approximately one tonne of carbon emissions annually; and

Ripcell piloted the use of green solvent from distillery waste to recover critical minerals from EV batteries. A life cycle analysis carried out with the University of Aberdeen found that the process is carbon negative with a Global Warming Potential of -1.59kg.

3.57 Some projects had received funding to refurbish existing buildings or construct new buildings and described how carbon reduction and sustainability principles had been incorporated into the build:

The Energy Skills Hub has used whole life carbon as a metric to minimise carbon emissions within its build and will use renewable energy to heat the building;

The NEAT project’s infrastructure build had been designed in line with green energy strategies. Key measures taken included the use of local materials, the capture of rainwater and the use of renewable energy;

Seedpod, an innovation hub for the food and drink industry, will be 100% electrically powered through green energy sources and onsite PV cells. Once operational, it will support food and drink businesses to adopt energy efficiency measures through showcasing technologies and hosting events; and

The construction of Cabrach Distillery involves an anaerobic digestion plant to recycle their co-products and produce green gas.

The project has been designed and delivered in line with ETZ Net Zero Principles to ensure whole life, embodied and operational carbon are minimised. ETZ Net Zero Principles ensure a focus on circular economy, building performance and energy strategy, as well as the role the development will play in improving landscape and delivering community benefit. Whole Life Carbon analysis is the primary metric through the design and construction phase and further metrics include operational carbon and energy performance. (Advanced Skills Manufacturing Hub, Survey Response)

Environmental protection and adaptation

Initiatives for biodiversity and land restoration

3.58 Some of the projects described how they were enabling carbon sequestration through the creation of greenspaces and planting of trees, e.g. Findhorn Watershed Initiative and others had developed plans to do this as part of their future activity e.g. Energy Transition Skills Hub. The Moray Council JT Masterplan included research into carbon sequestration on Council land and identified 133 hectares as potential sites for tree and shrub planting, which could sequester 1,341 tons of CO2 each year.

3.59 Other actions taken to improve biodiversity included improvements at the VSA Easter Anguston Farm to enhance species protection and the creation of a scrape as part of NEAT’s mountain-biking infrastructure build to provide a habitat for amphibians and insects.

3.60 The work of Findhorn Watershed Initiative has, however, been focused on riparian woodland restoration, with the planting of woodlands along riverbanks used to reduce water temperature. The project began planting in January 2024 and is expected to have restored 125 hectares of woodland by Spring 2025 (Year 3). The projected emissions savings from the woodland planting is 5,064 tco2e over the scheme’s lifetime. More details of their restoration work, and its impact, are provided in the showcase example.

Project delivery challenges

3.61 While the JTF supported a collection of diverse projects across sectors that delivered a wide range of benefits, project leads encountered challenges in delivering funded activities.

3.62 The most cited issues included tight project timelines, funding uncertainty, and communication difficulties. Many projects operated within compressed timeframes, requiring rapid implementation that did not always align with the scale or nature of their project. Uncertainty around funding availability and timing created financial and operational hurdles, particularly for projects relying on multi-year investment. In addition, shifting priorities, rising costs, and administrative constraints impacted project planning and execution. Some organisations struggled with capacity limitations, particularly in smaller teams managing ambitious initiatives. Stakeholder engagement and partnership working presented further difficulties, with some projects experiencing delays due to the need for extensive collaboration across multiple organisations.

Project-specific challenges - partnership working

3.63 Most projects relied on collaboration across sectors, but misaligned priorities, power imbalances, and communication challenges sometimes needed to be addressed. When a project involved multiple stakeholders, overcoming power divides between large and smaller projects and allowing more time to manage relationships was important for these projects to progress.

Project-specific challenges – technical issues and capacity

3.64 Some projects faced engineering and logistical obstacles, particularly those involving infrastructure, technology, or environmental considerations. Procurement and supply chain delays affected some project timelines. In some cases, to project designs to address unexpected environmental assessments resulted in additional costs and some highly technical initiatives, design and implementation challenges had to be overcome. For example, the Net Zero Technology Centre’s offshore hydrogen project had to address corrosion, offshore efficiency, and modularisation constraints.

3.65 Smaller and volunteer-led organisations sometimes lacked specialist expertise or additional administrative and project management support to manage their projects.

Project-specific challenges – changing operational environment

3.66 A further challenge was the changing circumstances in which the projects operated and this impacted on their progress. Rising costs, driven by inflation and supply chain disruptions, placed financial strain on initiatives, particularly those involving construction or specialised equipment. Some projects also had to navigate shifting priorities, both within their organisations and in the broader policy environment, e.g. Post-Brexit supply chain issues, requiring them to adapt plans mid-delivery.

Congress has typically responded to severe natural disasters — hurricanes, wildfires, floods — with emergency funding to help affected communities weather the damage and rebuild.","The weekend’s fatal floods in Texas have sparked immediate clashes in Congress over the federal government’s role in preventing, or at least minimizing, the human toll of natural disasters.

On one side are Democrats pointing to the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Weather Service (NWS) as a potential reason the flood victims were not better forewarned. They’re calling for investigations into why the alert systems in place were not more effective.

On the other side are President Trump’s GOP allies, who argue that the president’s efforts to slash federal agencies, including the NWS, were a nonfactor in what they say was simply a freak natural calamity. They’re accusing the Democrats of exploiting a natural disaster for their own political gain.

The partisan dispute could hamper what is likely to be the coming debate over Congress’s emergency response to the severe flooding in the Hill Country of Central Texas, where at least 90 people — including girls attending a summer camp — were killed as the waters of the Guadalupe River rose violently in the earliest hours of July 4.

The massive flooding has put the GOP on the back foot as lawmakers try to defend the federal response and actions by the administration after roughly one-sixth of the weather service’s workforce was culled over the past six months. The cuts were part of Trump’s strategy to use the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — an extension of the White House initially led by the billionaire Elon Musk — as a vehicle to shrink the federal government.

Trump’s allies said the failure occurred within regional, not federal, ranks.

“The challenge was at a local level,” Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) told reporters at the Capitol on Monday, noting that “some sort of wide-ranging notification should have been possible.”

“That didn’t happen. That’s not anything from the national level, but I think we need to take a look at how to prevent this. It was just a bad situation all around,” said Budd, who has dealt with the recovery of western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene for most of the past year. “This was a horrible storm. … This was an act of nature.”

Some Democrats, for their part, are highlighting the cuts to the NWS as a potential reason that warnings from weather experts and local authorities did not reach the victims in time to compel an evacuation.

“I’m personally praying that Donald Trump finally understands this is not a game — it’s real life and there are serious consequences to playing politics with our security and emergency preparedness,” Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement.

“He was warned this could happen, he was told in clear terms that his weather service cuts could lead to needless deaths, and he didn’t care,” Martin continued. “As Donald Trump continues to ignore experts and gut our critical safety services, he is putting Americans everywhere in danger.”

Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), who represents nearby San Antonio, raised similar questions. Responding to reports that several Texas offices of the NWS had vacancies resulting from Trump’s DOGE purge, Castro said there needs to be an investigation into whether those cuts were a factor.

“On most days, obviously, you’re not going to have a tragedy like this, but when you have flash flooding, there’s a risk that you won’t have the personnel to … do that analysis, do the predictions in the best way. And it could lead to tragedy,” he said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” program.

“I don’t want to sit here and say conclusively that that was the case, but I do think that it should be investigated.”

Rep. Becca Balint (D), a Vermont liberal, was more forceful.

“We knew that these cuts would have deadly consequences,” she posted on the social platform X. “The NWS budget isn’t just a number that can be slashed because Trump and DOGE feel like it. These are real services that would have saved real people.”

Amid the finger-pointing, the NWS issued a statement on Monday dismissing the idea that understaffing in Texas offices might have contributed to the tragedy. Rather, the agency said it had additional forecasters in those regional offices in anticipation of heavy rains in the area, and that “all forecasts and warnings were issued in a timely manner.”

“Additionally, these offices were able to provide decision support services to local partners, including those in the emergency management community,” the agency said.

That has not prevented some local officials from accusing the NWS of giving what they consider misleading forecasts about the severity of the rain and the subsequent flooding.

“Everybody got the forecast from the National Weather Service,” said Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd. “It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw.”

What can be done on the congressional side remains an unanswered question, and one that might take some time to become clear. Congress has typically responded to severe natural disasters — hurricanes, wildfires, floods — with emergency funding to help affected communities weather the damage and rebuild. But even that once-routine process has been hamstrung by the partisan polarization that practically defines contemporary politics.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on Sunday that he feels “helpless” for now until supplemental requests roll in from lawmakers in the area and a greater assessment of the damage is conducted.

​​“Every available resource has been deployed. The president, of course, is dialed in and watching this develop moment by moment, as we are,” he told Fox News. “We will handle supplemental funding requests as they come in, but right now they’re still trying to do rescue and recovery, and our hearts go out to all of them.”

An outstanding question is whether any new emergency funding would have to be offset with changes elsewhere in the budget, or would be conditioned on separate policy reforms, as some Republicans have demanded of California wildfire aid. Those demands have delayed the delivery of emergency aid — and infuriated Democrats, who have accused Republicans of favoring red states over blue ones.

“Republicans spent months threatening to condition disaster assistance to devastated communities. That behavior was disgraceful,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) posted Monday on X. “Our job is to help everyone in need.”

At this point, lawmakers seem open to a supplemental funding package, though they admit it will take time to figure out a dollar amount.

“We want to take a look at it, but anything we can do to help,” Budd said, noting the December government funding bill included $100 billion for the state’s recovery efforts. “We want to, certainly, be open to that.

“But let’s get through the immediate stage right now, take care of lives, save as many lives as possible, assess the damage and then come with an accurate request of what’s needed,” he continued. “There’s enough emotion involved on this. Let’s wait until we actually know, then let’s take care of the people first.”

Politics almost always play a role in disaster recovery.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Monday called on the inspector general at the Commerce Department to probe the vacancies at NWS to determine whether they played a role in the rising death toll.

But lawmakers also appeared unified in arguing that whatever is to blame, there has to be a remedy to what happened.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Floods_070725_AP_Julio-Cortez.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-08 03:01:38.693835

The global direct lithium extraction market is heating up fast, with Research and Markets tracking 25 major players all chasing the same prize.","Two Stanford grads working out of a biotech complex in Burlingame think they've cracked the code on one of the clean energy world's biggest headaches: how to get lithium out of the ground without destroying the planet or going broke in the process.

Eric McShane and Evan Gardner's startup, Electroflow Technologies, is making some pretty bold claims. They say their electrochemical extraction process can pull lithium from brine at $1,500 per metric ton—compared to the usual $3,500 to $8,000 it costs everyone else. If they're right, it's the kind of breakthrough that could reshape America's entire battery supply chain.

The ""Perfect Mitt"" for Lithium

Here's where it gets interesting: instead of the traditional evaporation ponds that take up massive amounts of land and water, Gardner describes their approach as using battery cathode materials as The Wall Street Journal reported, ""the perfect mitt to grab the mineral directly from water."" Their single-step process achieves 96% recovery rates while using just one-tenth the water of conventional methods—a stark contrast to the typical 40-60% recovery rates from those sprawling evaporation ponds.

The technology caught the attention of some heavyweight backers. Both founders landed spots in Breakthrough Energy's Innovator Fellows program—that's Bill Gates' climate tech accelerator, for those keeping track, according to Breakthrough Energy. And when they tested their system at a California geothermal project in April, McShane said it ""performed very similarly to the lab,"" as he told The Wall Street Journal—always a good sign when you're moving from theory to reality.

Utah Proves the Point

But the real validation came from their partnership with Australian company Mandrake Resources at a Utah lithium project. In May 2024, Electroflow hit 92% lithium recoveries, according to Investing News—the kind of numbers that get investors' attention. Even better, Mandrake snagged US$1 million in Department of Energy grant funding for the project, as reported by Investing News, putting Electroflow in line for federal infrastructure funding.

Now they're gearing up for an $8 million seed round this month, building on the $2.8 million they've already raised from investors including Fifty Years, Harpoon Ventures, and StartX, according to PitchBook. That's not exactly spare change, but in a market where the competition is throwing around much bigger numbers, it's still relatively modest.

Racing Against Well-Funded Rivals

Speaking of competition—it's getting crowded out there. Oakland-based Lilac Solutions just dropped data showing their tech can recover 90% of lithium while cutting construction costs in half, as Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Melbourne's ElectraLith is producing 99.9% pure lithium hydroxide. The global direct lithium extraction market is heating up fast, with Research and Markets tracking 25 major players all chasing the same prize.

The numbers tell the story: the lithium mining market is projected to grow at 9.7% annually through 2035, with direct extraction technologies leading the charge at a blistering 19.6% growth rate, according to IDTechEx.

Perfect Timing for Domestic Production

Here's where the timing gets really interesting. The Inflation Reduction Act basically handed companies like Electroflow a golden opportunity. Starting this year, electric vehicles only qualify for federal tax credits if their battery minerals come from the US or free trade partners—and those requirements ramp up to 80% by 2027, the US Treasury Department confirmed. Translation: America desperately needs domestic lithium production, and it's willing to pay for it.

The policy push has already triggered more than $110 billion in clean energy investments, with over $70 billion earmarked specifically for battery supply chains, according to Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. Global demand for these critical minerals could increase 400-600%, as Mayer Brown research suggests—which explains why everyone's suddenly racing to solve the lithium puzzle.

Bay Area's Latest Energy Play

Electroflow is betting big from their base on Mitten Road, where they're part of a biotech complex that houses everything from diagnostic labs to pharmaceutical companies. It's a fitting location for a company trying to bridge chemistry and engineering, sitting in the heart of the Bay Area's growing energy storage ecosystem—which includes 282 companies ranging from household names like SunPower to emerging players, according to Tracxn.

Harpoon Ventures founder Larsen Jensen—a former Navy SEAL and two-time Olympic medalist who knows something about high-stakes performance—said he's particularly excited about the company's ability to convert lithium ""all the way to cathode material,"" as he told The Wall Street Journal. That's industry speak for turning raw materials into something car manufacturers can actually use.

Whether Electroflow can deliver on its ambitious promises remains to be seen. But with federal policy creating massive incentives for domestic lithium production and the EV market demanding supplies that simply don't exist yet, this July fundraising round will be a real test of whether investors believe the Stanford duo can turn laboratory breakthroughs into industrial reality.

The stakes couldn't be higher—or the timing more perfect.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/7/stanford-duo-raises-millions-claims-to-make-us-lithium-production-affordable-via-burlingame-startup-2.webp,N,,2025-07-08 00:01:39.548603

This will implement the One Big Beautiful Bill’s directive to the Secretary of the Interior to approve onshore commingling applications. This approach allows oil and gas to be produced from different leases, often under different ownership, using the same well pad, which reduces environmental impacts, lowers operating costs and increases overall efficiency.

Current Bureau of Land Management regulations restrict commingling to leases that have identical mineral ownership, royalty rates and revenue distribution. These requirements create unnecessary barriers in many areas of the West where mineral ownership is complex and varied. The proposed changes would allow commingling even when these conditions differ, unlocking energy potential that is currently tied up in regulatory red tape.

“This is about common sense and catching up with today’s technology,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “The current rules were written for a different era. These updates will help us manage public resources more efficiently, support responsible energy production, and make sure taxpayers and tribes get every dollar they’re owed.”

Thanks to major advancements in metering and measurement technologies, operators can now accurately track production and allocate royalties even at the individual wellhead. These technologies meet the precision standards required by the Bureau of Land Management and ensure that all mineral owners receive their fair share. By incorporating these advances into its regulations, the agency will better reflect modern industry practices while maintaining its commitment to transparency and accountability.

If finalized, the updated rules could result in as much as $1.8 billion in industry savings annually. Those savings would give operators the ability to reinvest in new energy production, helping drive domestic energy development while reducing the need for duplicative infrastructure. This rule would also allow for greater flexibility in how production is combined and measured, which will not only increase efficiency but also reduce surface disturbance, benefiting both industry and the environment.

This proposed rule change supports recent directives from the Trump administration and the Department to reduce regulatory burdens, promote energy development, and modernize outdated policies. The Bureau of Land Management intends to move quickly to update the relevant regulations under 43 CFR Subpart 3173, with a formal rulemaking process to follow, including opportunities for public comment.

Additionally, the OBBB codified the “beginning of construction rules,” in effect as of January 1, 2025, as it pertains to the “prohibited foreign entity” restrictions.","OBBB made changes to various tax provisions – including tax rates, modification of treatment of state and local taxes, individual tax breaks, establishment of “Trump Accounts,” extension of bonus depreciation, and revisions to international tax regimes (see coverage of some of these other changes here). OBBB also made sweeping changes to tax benefits and incentives previously expanded or introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”).

Though passage of the OBBB followed months of negotiations, rumors, horse trading, and release of various iterations – each seemingly slightly worse for the clean energy industry – the final version is thematically not *that* different than the version first released by the House in May.1 Thankfully, an excise tax that would have impacted solar and wind projects after 2027, included in an interim Senate version of the bill, was stripped out of the final version passed by Congress.

While the OBBB is undoubtedly big, it is far from beautiful for the clean energy industry.

Notably, OBBB terminates consumer tax credits for renewable energy (under Section 25D) and energy efficiency improvements (under Sections 25C, 45L, and 179D) and eliminates electric vehicle credits previously available for new and used electric vehicles and commercial fleets.2

It also brings in termination dates for technology neutral tax credits (Sections 45Y and 48E) – under OBBB these credits will start to phase down after 2032 for most technologies, with a major exception for wind and solar facilities, which are denied tax credits if they are placed in service after 2027, unless they began construction prior to July 4, 2026.3

There are a few positives to be found – the Section 45Z clean fuel production tax credit was extended through the end of 2029 (a real win for the renewable natural gas industry), the Section 45Q carbon capture and sequestration credit rate for utilization and for use as a tertiary injectant was increased, and 100% bonus depreciation was made permanent. In addition, fuel cell facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025, were added as qualifying technologies for the technology neutral tax credits.

Perhaps the most impactful changes are the “prohibited foreign entity” limitations which are littered throughout the OBBB.4 As discussed further in our prior coverage, these limitations include disallowance of certain credits if the taxpayer is one of these entities, controlled by one of these entities, makes certain payments to one of these entities, or receives “material assistance” from one of these entities. There would also be a potential 100% recapture of the clean electricity credit under Section 48E if a taxpayer makes an “applicable payment” to one of these entities within ten years after originally claiming the credit (essentially creating a 10-year period of recapture risk for the technology neutral investment tax credit). These limitations have almost an immediate impact – generally, being effective January 1, 2026, for calendar year taxpayers – and will impose a significant risk, compliance, and diligence burden on taxpayers. The clean energy industry will need to work together to quickly develop strategies for sharing information and documenting compliance.

For better or worse, taxpayers should expect further guidance implementing these changes out of the Department of Treasury and, potentially, the Executive Branch. OBBB directs and permits Treasury to issue guidance on a number of areas – including with respect to prohibited foreign entity limitations and Section 45Z emissions rates for animal manure – but this guidance may not be released for some time. As such, taxpayers will need to rely on the statutory language included in the OBBB in the near term.5

Republican leadership in the House of Representatives and the Senate have also expressed a desire for further legislation later this year, either in a bipartisan bill or another budget reconciliation bill. As such, while the focus may now turn to the regulatory guidance needed to implement the OBBB, taxpayers should stay alert for further legislative changes later this year.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the OBBB, please reach out to your V&E contacts.

1 We’ve covered some (but not all) of these releases here, here, here and here.

2 Though earlier versions of OBBB prohibited taxpayers from claiming tax credits for certain energy property that the taxpayer rented or leased to a third party, the final version of the OBBB only included this limitation on rented or leased solar water heating property and qualified small wind energy property.

3 These credits were previously scheduled to phase down after the later of 2032 and the calendar year in which annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the U.S. are equal to or less than 25% of the amount of such greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.

4 Notably, the clean hydrogen production tax credit (Section 45V) does not have a prohibited foreign entity restriction; however, the Section 45V credit termination date was accelerated for projects that do not begin construction before January 1, 2028.

5 It has been reported that certain House of Representatives members conditioned their approval of the OBBB on assurances from the Executive Branch regarding the implementation of certain “high-risk” provisions in the OBBB, including the beginning of construction safe harbors and prohibited foreign entity guidance, among others. Whether this happens remains to be seen.

Additionally, the OBBB codified the “beginning of construction rules,” in effect as of January 1, 2025, as it pertains to the “prohibited foreign entity” restrictions. While it may be unlikely that different rules would apply in other contexts, it is possible that the beginning of construction rules outside of the “prohibited foreign entity” restrictions will be clarified or tightened further.",https://media.velaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/15163735/Inflation-Reduction-Act.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 22:04:06.884375

(Reuters) -Europe’s car industry could return to producing 16.8 million cars a year, equalling its post-2008 crisis peak, if the European Union maintains its 2035 clean cars target and implements policies to support the transition, a study published by campaign group Transport & Environment showed on Tuesday.

Conversely, deploying no industrial strategy and going back on the 2035 target that all new cars and vans sold in the EU no longer emit carbon dioxide could result in a loss of 1 million auto industry jobs and two-thirds of planned battery investments, T&E said in a statement.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

Already challenged by high costs in their home markets and a gap to Chinese and U.S. rivals in the electric vehicle industry, European carmakers now face the effects of U.S. President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on auto imports, which have pushed many manufacturers to pull their forecasts for 2025.

Following heavy lobbying, the European Parliament gave its backing to a softening some of the EU CO2 emissions targets for cars and vans in May, but it has so far stuck the regulations that will bar the sale of fossil-fuel cars by 2035.

KEY QUOTES

“It’s a make or break moment for Europe’s automotive industry as the global competition to lead the production of electric cars, batteries and chargers is immense,” Julia Poliscanova, Senior Director for Vehicles & Emobility Supply Chains at T&E, said in the statement.

BY THE NUMBERS

If the 2035 goal is maintained and policies to boost domestic EV production are implemented, the automotive value chain’s contribution to the European economy would grow 11% by 2035, the advocacy group said.

Related stories: Trump rescissions bill undermines American allies, national security","Leaders of the House energy coalition are calling U.S. Senate passage of President Donald Trump‘s “Big, Beautiful Bill” the “Big, Ugly Blackout Bill” because it will destroy American energy security.

According to the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC), including Co-Chairs Reps. Doris Matsui, Mike Quigley, and Paul Tonko and Vice Chairs Reps. Don Beyer, Suzanne Bonamici, Sean Casten, Mike Levin and Chellie Pingree, Trump’s H.R. 1 will kills jobs and send electricity costs through the roof for American families.

“Despite stark and repeated warnings from every sector of the American economy, Senate Republicans today ignored all reason and passed their extreme ‘Blackout Bill.’ This disastrous legislation will cause more frequent and severe blackouts across the country, drive up household electricity bills by more than $400 a year, and kill hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs. This bill cedes America’s leadership in the industries of the future while giving handouts to the industries of the past. Senate Republicans have betrayed their own constituents and ignored the desperate warnings of American industry and consumers in order to bail out the oil industry and hand out tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans,” the leadership said.

Good-paying clean energy manufacturing jobs across the United States are already at risk because of the prospect of the bill becoming American law but are “the tip of the iceberg for the real pain that is about to be unleashed. We’ve already seen more than 90,000 clean energy jobs lost or threatened this year, and early reports predict that another 400,000 clean energy jobs will soon follow.”

“Clean energy is cheap energy. Unfortunately, Congressional Republicans don’t really care about your electricity bills. Congressional Republicans only care about appeasing Donald Trump. If that means killing American jobs and making energy more expensive to satisfy Trump’s personal grievances against wind turbines and solar panels, so be it. If it means aggressively putting the thumb on the scale for dirtier and more expensive fossil fuel energy sources, even as the oil and gas industry continues to pollute our communities and make our children sick, so be it. They will throw our entire country under the bus just to satisfy President Trump’s whims,” the leaders said.

The SEEC leaders said the madness can be stopped and encouraged Republican colleagues in the U.S. House to see the bill for what it really is: “the wholesale destruction of affordable domestic clean energy production that will lead to an extreme price hike on the American people.”

The SEEC is a coalition of 100 members of the U.S. House of Representatives that was founded in January 2009 to be a focused, active, and effective coalition for advancing policies that address climate change, promote clean energy innovation and domestic manufacturing, develop renewable energy resources, create family-sustaining clean jobs, protect our nation’s air, water, and natural environment, and promote environmental justice.

The Cayenne Electric will set new standards – without compromising on everyday usability and practicality.""
The Cayenne Electric will be on display at the Goodwood Festival of Speed this weekend, but it may not be fully revealed until next year.","After much speculation Porsche announced last year that the next-generation Cayenne SUV will be fully electric, with the current internal-combustion Cayenne to continue on with more V8s and hybrid powertrains. Porsche says it's still ""long before the market launch"" of the Cayenne Electric, but the company is now showing off near-production prototypes with barely any camouflage not just driving around in public, but competing in hill climbs — and winning.

A few weeks ago, a Cayenne EV prototype was entered in the Shelsley Walsh Hill Climb in Worcestershire, England, which has been running since 1905. Gabriela Jílková, a development driver for Porsche's Formula E team, took the Cayenne Electric up the hill and beat the previous SUV record (set by a Bentley Bentayga) by more than four seconds on her very first attempt. Coinciding with the same event, ex-""Top Gear"" presenter Richard Hammond got to experience the towing capacity of the Cayenne Electric, which will be the same as the combustion Cayenne.

Shelsley Walsh Hill Climb is 1,000 yards long and features a grade of up to 16.7%, and as Jílková describes it, ""The course is challenging and does not forgive mistakes, there are no run-off zones and little room for correction."" The Cayenne she drove was a prototype, but Porsche says the powertrain and equipment were already production-spec, and it was equipped with summer tires. Jílková rocketed the Cayenne up the hill in 31.28 seconds, but Porsche says the more impressive stat is that 60 yards were covered in just 1.94 seconds, a feat only matched at the event by single-seat race cars on slicks. It looks properly rapid.

The electric Cayenne will be offered with Porsche's Active Ride suspension system that was first introduced on the Panamera and Taycan. It's able to keep the body level even under hard cornering and braking while still offering great ride comfort, and surely it'll be able to do some cool off-road stuff — in the Panamera and Taycan, the Active Ride system can immediately raise the ride height as soon as you open the door.

Porsche says the Cayenne Electric will be able to tow up to 7,716 pounds, which is the same as a current internal-combustion Cayenne. Aside from the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ, which can tow up to 10,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, that'll put the Cayenne EV at the top of the list in terms of electric SUV towing capacities. The Rivian R1S can pull an almost-as-good 7,700 pounds, while the Lucid Gravity can tow 6,000 pounds, the BMW iX and Polestar 3 can tow 3,500 pounds, and the Mercedes-Benz G580 can't tow at all.

To show that off, Richard Hammond used the Cayenne prototype to tow his 100-plus-year-old Lagonda sports car to the hill climb. He doesn't get to talk too much about what the Cayenne is like to drive, but he's certainly positive about Porsche offering EVs like this next-gen Cayenne along with internal-combustion models.

This is also our best look yet at the Cayenne Electric's design, and I think it's looking really good. It looks a lot longer than the current Cayenne, with a thicker D-pillar and less coupe-like roofline. It looks wider, too, with a great stance accented by the fender flares, nice body sculpting and fat tires. There are no split headlight pods here, with the Cayenne's only headlights being fairly slim units at the top of the nose with a four-point design.

Late last month, a federal judge in Seattle granted a temporary injunction to unfreeze $875 million in federal funds for the stations. It went into effect on July 2 as the judge cited the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act as grounds for the injunction.

16 states and the District of Columbia had sued the Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration and staff members following Trump’s executive order freezing what remained of the $3.74 billion National EV Infrastructure program (NEVI).

Environmental groups decried the reconsideration of the leases in the Powder River Basin on Monday, calling it a giveaway to the coal and fossil fuel industry.
""Expanding coal production in the Powder River Basin would mean improved access to affordable, reliable energy and increased investment in Second District communities,"" Downing said in a statement.","The Trump administration is considering reversing a Biden-era decision from last year that blocked future coal leasing on public land in the Powder River Basin in eastern Montana and northeastern Wyoming.

The Bureau of Land Management announced Monday it is planning to conduct new environmental reviews that will inform a decision of whether to allow about 1.2 million acres of federal coal in Montana and 480,000 acres in Wyoming to be made available for future leasing.

Should the agency, under the Trump administration’s executive order to “unleash” American energy, decide to open the lands for leasing, it would reverse the agency’s rule finalized late last year to end any future coal leasing in the basin — about 1.7 million acres of land. Last year's move was part of the Biden administration’s effort to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions and reduce reliance on the sometimes shaky domestic coal market.

“These directives prioritize the allocation of energy resources on public lands and the federal mineral estate, including a possible revision of coal leasing decisions in the resource management plans for the Miles City and Buffalo field offices,” the Bureau of Land Management wrote in a news release Monday.

Once the BLM’s new proposals are posted in the Federal Register on Tuesday, the public will have until Aug. 7 to submit comments on whether to reopen the land to leasing or to have the agency stick with its previous decision to prevent future coal leasing in the basin, which accounts for about 85% of federal coal production and 40% of all U.S. coal production.

Montana’s four-person Republican federal delegation — U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and U.S. Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing — was vocally opposed to last year’s decision to end future coal leasing in the basin, as was Montana’s Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte. The State of Montana joined Wyoming in December to sue the Bureau of Land Management, seeking to overturn its decision made last November.

Gianforte on Monday said he supported the administration’s new look at possible leasing and said the Biden administration ignored Montana’s priorities and threatened coal-country jobs.

“I’m grateful to President Donald J. Trump and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum for recognizing the importance of increasing production of American-made energy to secure our energy future and create more jobs,” Gianforte said in a statement to the Montana State News Bureau.

UPDATED: Mine owners, lawmakers react to BLM's proposal to end coal leases for mines in Montana, Wyoming

A 2022 federal court decision found the Bureau of Land Management had violated the National Environmental Policy Act when granting previous land use plan amendments by failing to analyze the public health and environmental effects of coal mining. The court ordered the BLM to undertake a new analysis that did look into those effects.

Last year's decision from the Bureau of Land Management, the result of that court-ordered analysis, found coal markets have continued to decline, there were no projected new mines in the area being considered, and coal-fired power plants could be converted to utilize renewable energy. It forecasted existing operations at Rosebud Mine, which supplies Colstrip, could continue to 2060 and that operations at the Spring Creek Mine could continue to 2035. The two produced about 37 million pounds of coal in 2022, about two-thirds of their output in 2007.

The agency’s analysis last year found the two mines could continue to support 600 jobs through 2035 and bring in about $50 million each year.

However, most of the GOP in the West has pushed for increased fossil fuel production with the party back in charge of Congress and the White House. The “Big, Beautiful Bill” passed by Republicans in Congress and signed by President Donald Trump last week was favorable to coal mining, cutting royalty rates and ensuring coal plant operations into the future.

Environmental groups decried the reconsideration of the leases in the Powder River Basin on Monday, calling it a giveaway to the coal and fossil fuel industry.

Montana congressmen: Trump's ‘Big, Beautiful’ bill meets voters’ ‘mandate,’ juices economy

“Just last year, the Bureau of Land Management found it impossible to justify continued coal leasing in the Powder River Basin considering the abundant coal already under lease, shrinking demand, and the imperative to phase out fossil fuel development to address the climate crisis,” Jenny Harbin, the managing attorney for Earthjustice’s Northern Rockies office, said in a statement. “The administration’s efforts to expand coal mining on our public lands are no more justified now and will sell out our communities to further enrich coal industry executives.”

Gabby Wiggins, a spokesperson for Daines, said Monday he was “glad to see” the proposal from the Bureau of Land Management.

“Senator Daines will always fight to support our state’s miners and bolster Made-In-Montana energy,” she said in an email.

U.S. Rep. Troy Downing, the Republican who represents eastern Montana, said it was ""extraordinarily encouraging"" to see such a move from the Trump administration.

""Expanding coal production in the Powder River Basin would mean improved access to affordable, reliable energy and increased investment in Second District communities,"" Downing said in a statement. ""I applaud BLM's efforts and will continue to use my voice and vote to advocate on behalf of Treasure State energy production and the countless Montanans this industry supports.""

U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy also lauded the proposal.

""It’s refreshing to have an administration focused on protecting Montana jobs, unleashing our resource economy, and making energy affordable, accessible, and reliable again,"" Sheehy said in a statement. ""Coal keeps the lights on, and Montanans voted to make America energy dominant so we can bring down prices for families and boost real wages for the hardworking Americans who keep our economy running.”

People interested in submitting comments on the proposal can do so beginning Tuesday on the Federal Register website through the “Participate Now” button or by mailing them to the Miles City and Buffalo field offices.

This is what we’re trying to do.” Restoring the existing energy infrastructure Some of the efforts focus on simply repairing infrastructure destroyed in the war.
Al-Bashir said Syria’s infrastructure that has been repaired can provide 5,000 megawatts, about half the country’s needs, but fuel and gas shortages have hampered generation.
The plan will look at Syria’s projected energy demand and determine how much of it can come from renewable sources.
The focus is economic recovery The removal of sanctions signals to U.S. businesses that Trump is serious in his support for Syria’s recovery, Idlibi said.","DAMASCUS, Syria — Abdulrazak al-Jenan swept the dust off his solar panel on his apartment roof overlooking Damascus. Syria’s largest city was mostly pitch-black, the few speckles of light coming from the other households able to afford solar panels, batteries, or private generators.

Al-Jenan went thousands of dollars in debt to buy his solar panel in 2019. It was an expensive coping mechanism at the time, but without it, he couldn’t charge his phone and run the refrigerator.

Syria has not had more than four hours of state electricity per day for years, as a result of the nearly 14-year civil war that ended with the ouster of former President Bashar Assad in December.

Syria’s new leaders are hoping renewable energy will now become more than a patchwork solution. Investment is beginning to return to the country with the lifting of U.S. sanctions, and major energy projects are planned, including an industrial-scale solar farm that would secure about a tenth of the country’s energy needs.

“The solution to the problem isn’t putting solar panels on roofs,” Syria’s interim Energy Minister Mohammad al-Bashir told The Associated Press. “It’s securing enough power for the families through our networks in Syria. This is what we’re trying to do.”

Restoring the existing energy infrastructure

Some of the efforts focus on simply repairing infrastructure destroyed in the war. The World Bank recently announced a $146 million grant to help Syria repair damaged transmission lines and transformer substations. Al-Bashir said Syria’s infrastructure that has been repaired can provide 5,000 megawatts, about half the country’s needs, but fuel and gas shortages have hampered generation. With the sanctions lifted, that supply could come in soon.

More significantly, Syria recently signed a $7 billion energy deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and American companies. The program over the next three and a half years would develop four combined-cycle gas turbines with a total generating capacity estimated at approximately 4,000 megawatts and a 1,000-megawatt solar farm. This would “broadly secure the needs” of Syrians, said Al-Bashir.

While Syria is initially focusing on fixing its existing fossil fuel infrastructure to improve quality of life, help make businesses functional again, and entice investors, the U.N. Development Program said in May that a renewable energy plan will be developed in the next year for the country.

The plan will look at Syria’s projected energy demand and determine how much of it can come from renewable sources.

“Given the critical role of energy in Syria’s recovery, we have to rapidly address energy poverty and progressively accelerate the access to renewable energy,” Sudipto Mukerjee, UNDP’s resident representative in Syria, said in a statement announcing the plan.

Sanctions crippled the power grid

While the war caused significant damage to Syria’s infrastructure, crippling Washington-led sanctions imposed during the Assad dynasty’s decades of draconian rule made it impossible for Syria to secure fuel and spare parts to generate power.

“Many companies over the past period would tell us the sanctions impact matters like imports, implementing projects, transferring funds and so on,” al-Bashir said.

During a visit to Turkey in May, the minister said Syria could only secure about 1700 megawatts, a little less than 20%, of its energy needs.

A series of executive orders by U.S. President Donald Trump lifted many sanctions on Syria, aiming to end the country’s isolation from the global banking system so that it can become viable again and rebuild itself.

The United Nations estimates the civil war caused hundreds of billions of dollars in damages and economic losses across the country. Some 90% of Syrians live in poverty. Buying solar panels, private generators or other means of producing their own energy has been out of reach for most of the population.

“Any kind of economic recovery needs a functional energy sector,” said Joseph Daher, Syrian-Swiss economist and researcher, who said that stop-gap measures like solar panels and private generators were luxuries only available to a few who could afford it. “There is also a need to diminish the cost of electricity in Syria, which is one of the most expensive in the region.”

Prices for electricity in recent years surged as the country under its former rulers struggled with currency inflation and rolling back on subsidies. The new officials who inherited the situation say that lifting sanctions will help them rectify the country’s financial and economic woes, and provide sufficient and affordable electricity as soon as they can.

“The executive order lifts most of the obstacles for political and economic investment with Syria,” said Qutaiba Idlibi, who leads the Americas section of the Foreign Ministry.

Syria has been under Washington-led sanctions for decades, but designations intensified during the war that started in 2011. Even with some waivers for humanitarian programs, it was difficult to bring in resources and materials to fix Syria’s critical infrastructure — especially electricity — further compounding the woes of the vast majority of Syrians, who live in poverty.

The focus is economic recovery

The removal of sanctions signals to U.S. businesses that Trump is serious in his support for Syria’s recovery, Idlibi said.

“Right now, we have a partnership with the United States as any normal country would do,” he said.

Meanwhile, Al-Jenan is able to turn on both his fans on a hot summer day while he watches the afternoon news on TV, as the temperature rises to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. He doesn’t want to let go of his solar panel but hopes the lifting of sanctions will eventually bring sustainable state electricity across the country.

“We can at least know what’s going on in the country and watch on TV,” he said. “We really were cut off from the entire world.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/07/Syria.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 20:11:15.460495

That means the $7,500 tax credit established under former President Joe Biden's EV initiative will expire on September 30.

President Donald Trump signed the Big Beautiful Bill into effect on Friday. That means the $7,500 tax credit established under former President Joe Biden's EV initiative will expire on September 30.

""If you're in the market for an EV and you're ready to commit to a new car, you should do that,"" Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at car shopping website Edmunds, told Business Insider.

Revised rules for the $7,500 federal tax credit went into effect last year and limited the number of EVs that qualified for the credit. However, 20 electric and hybrid vehicles, including all of Tesla's models and the Ford F150 Lightning, still qualify for the discount (you can check out the full list here.)

Some auto manufacturers, like Slate Auto, have already started to adjust their listings. The Jeff Bezos-backed EV startup recently removed the ""under $20,000"" expected price tag for its upcoming EV pickup truck, which the company previously expected to qualify for federal tax incentives. Now it says it's expected to cost in the ""mid-twenties.""

The federal EV tax credit has two parts. Consumers can qualify for a $3,750 credit if the vehicle meets either the critical minerals or battery component requirements. If it satisfies both criteria, consumers can get the full $7,500 credit.

To qualify for the $7,500 incentive, several additional criteria must be met: the vehicle must have a battery capacity of at least 7 kilowatt-hours, a gross vehicle weight rating under 14,000 pounds, and final assembly must take place in North America. Additionally, at least 50% of the battery's minerals and components must be sourced from the US or a country with a US free-trade agreement. There's also a suggested price cap for the incentive to apply.

Used EVS also have a clean vehicle tax credit, which allows certain buyers in an income bracket to be eligible for up to $4,000 for an EV with a sale price of $25,000 or less.

Brian Moody, lead senior editor for Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book, said that buyers in search of a used EV should also strive to make a purchase as soon as possible. Long-term, though, it won't make too much of a difference because used EVs ""depreciate very rapidly,"" Moody said. The average 1 to 5-year-old used EV price is around $31,110, according to data from iSeeCars.com.

""Even without the incentive, they're still going to end up being a great deal,"" Moody said about used EVs.

New EVs are another story — often commanding higher price tags than their gas-powered rivals.

Yoon said the average sticker price of a new EV is $63,026, and the average manufacturer's suggested retail price for a gas car is $50,273. While not having the $7,500 rebate will have an impact, some manufacturers may add their own discounts and incentives to help move inventory, Yoon said.

If you happen to be on the fence about getting an EV and you're not in the place for a big-ticket purchase, there may be some benefit to waiting. With the incentives increasing competition in the market, some auto manufacturers may up their game to convince buyers to convert, Moody said.

""This could end up making electric cars better overall because they'll have to now compete on an even playing field with cars that are powered by all different types of fuels, whether it's hydrogen, electric, or just gas,"" Moody said.

The shift wouldn't happen overnight or in the near-term future, given that manufacturers will have to work on outsourcing, tariffs, and price adjustments. However, it could be a long-term benefit.

According to AutoNews, the company recently informed suppliers that plans to build two new electric crossovers in Canton, Mississippi will be delayed by ten months. This means the Nissan model (codenamed PZ1K) is now slated to go into production in November 2028, while its Infiniti counterpart (codenamed PZ1J) has been pushed back until March of 2029.

In a statement to the publication, a Nissan spokesperson confirmed the delay and said “We’ve made the strategic decision to slightly adjust the production timeline for our EVs at the Canton plant. Our goal is to ensure that this facility continues to bring highly competitive vehicles to market that exceed customer expectations.”

Earlier this year, Nissan announced the “adventure-focused SUV” and said it would arrive late in the 2027 fiscal year. The Infiniti was slated to follow in 2028 and draw inspiration from the Vision QXe concept. At the time, the company said it would combine the “brand’s latest Artistry in Motion design language with a suite of technology features.”

Little else is known about the crossovers, but a teaser image showed the Nissan featured a boxy design that vaguely recalled the Xterra. The Infiniti, on the other hand, is far more curvaceous and aimed at luxury buyers.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nissan-EV-Teaser.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 20:10:35.442683

According to Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, solar and wind energy are now cheaper alternatives to fossil fuels like natural gas and coal.
Lewis said the budget bill also includes changes to tax breaks for building new power generation plants.
Sen. Bill Cassidy released this statement, “Democrats that are trying to discredit the One, Big, Beautiful bill are wrong.
This bill will increase energy development and lower utility bills for Louisiana families.","NEW ORLEANS — The so-called ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" signed by President Trump on July 4, phases out tax credits that reduce costs for producing solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources.

Louisiana has experienced a recent boom in large solar farms, particularly in Washington and St. James parishes.

According to Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, solar and wind energy are now cheaper alternatives to fossil fuels like natural gas and coal.

Lewis said the budget bill also includes changes to tax breaks for building new power generation plants.

""By phasing out some of these plans, de-incentivizing some of the cheaper options on the table right now such as wind, battery, and solar, even phasing out geothermal and nuclear as well means it's going to be a lot more costly to build the power need to make sure meet our demand,"" Lewis said.

Republican congressional leaders strongly dispute claims that household energy prices will increase because of this legislation.

“About 3% of Louisiana’s electricity demand is met with renewables, and even the majority of that is biomass, not wind or solar,"" a Congressional energy policy staffer said. ""So the idea that people’s electric bills are going to soar because the Louisiana taxpayer is no longer going to be subsidizing the green energy industry through their hard-earned tax dollars just simply doesn’t add up.”

According to House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., the law opens federal lands and waters to new oil and gas drilling.

He said during a news conference after the bill passed that this will strengthen national security and lower energy prices.

""The attack on American energy we've seen for four years crushed jobs, crushed the economy, forced families to pay too much for gas, and emboldened the enemies of our nation,"" Scalise said.

According to Jackson Voss from The Alliance for Affordable Energy, taking back tax breaks and investments in renewable energy will add more costs to consumers down the road.

""With the passage of this bill, there's going to be the end of a number of tax credit and rebate programs that people would have had to make energy efficiency upgrades to their homes, and that will make it harder for people to bring their electricity bills down,"" Voss said.

Scalise inserted a provision in the bill that increases the revenue sharing the state receives from energy exploration and production off the Louisiana coast.

He said the new funding will bring hundreds of millions of new dollars to Louisiana for coastal restoration and hurricane protection projects.

Sen. Bill Cassidy released this statement, “Democrats that are trying to discredit the One, Big, Beautiful bill are wrong. This bill will increase energy development and lower utility bills for Louisiana families. Energy installations that have started construction will continue.”

The companies said they believe the deal is worth more than $3 billion per year.

United Energy LNG, the title of the merged company, currently has three LNG production sites in development. The company will focus on small-scale liquefaction sites designed for regional demand.

“While the majors are focused on megaprojects, we’re deploying modular, nimble solutions that get LNG to the people and industries who need it now,” said Brian Guinn, CEO of United Energy LNG in the announcement.

The company is developing one site in Houston, one in Kansas and another on the Gulf Coast, according to the announcement. United Energy LNG has a targeted combined capacity of up to 540,000 metric tonnes a year.

The company plans to begin commissioning in 2027 and to start production by 2028.

Small-scale LNG differs from the traditional LNG production companies in the amount of LNG sold. The U.S. LNG market primarily involves companies that manufacture LNG to be sold in quantities that fill an ocean-going tanker. Small-scale LNG is sold by the truckload, train-car or small tanker load be used for on-site power generation.

The shift comes as new legislation threatens to reshape America’s energy landscape with far-reaching consequences for power generation and AI development. Meanwhile, scientific breakthroughs offer hope: researchers have developed a potential game-changer for the 8 million people living with type 1 diabetes, Japanese scientists demonstrate that AI models can achieve more by working together than alone, and Moderna’s mRNA flu vaccine shows promising results. Read on to learn how these developments could impact everything from your electricity bills to your healthcare.

Demand for residential solar plummets

The story: Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill cancels subsidies for green projects like solar and wind power and electric vehicles while initiating a tax break for fossil fuels. The bill requires the federal government to provide opportunities for oil and gas drilling on public lands, including in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska.

The numbers:

Royalty fees for offshore drilling will decrease from 16.67% to 12.5%

Coal mining royalty fees from 12.5% to 7%

Investment in electricity and clean fuels production could decrease by $500 billion by 2035, according to Princeton University’s REPEAT Project

The REPEAT Project also estimated that the bill will

Increase US household and business energy costs by $28 billion in 2030 and over $50 billion in 2035

Decrease clean electricity generation by more than 820 terawatt-hours in 2035

Increase US greenhouse gas emissions by 190 million metric tons per year in 2030

Why it matters: The Bill will slow America’s planned increases in power generation. This means less power for everyone: tech and manufacturing industries, as well as the growing American population. It could also mean losing the battle for AI dominance to China. Generative AI notoriously needs enormous amounts of power, meaning any slowdown in US generation will greatly impact the industry.

Watch for: Projects in green energy will race to be completed by the tax credit deadlines, while regional utilities and smaller developers may cancel clean energy pursuits. Household electricity and heating bills will likely increase alongside a push for more fossil fuels.

Tesla/EVs’ latest political earthquake

The story: Tesla’s stock is tumbling as CEO Elon Musk announced he would form a centrist “America Party,” prompting investor concerns about his focus on Tesla’s operations. The former DOGE chief has entered a public dispute with Trump, calling the president’s “Big Beautiful Bill” a “disgusting abomination.” The Congressional Budget Office projected the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which recently was signed into law, would add approximately $2.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Adding to Tesla’s woes, the very bill Musk denounces terminates the $7,500 EV tax credit after September 30, 2025.

The numbers:

Tesla stock down 21.9% YTD, 7% this past week alone

$7,500 new EV credit / $4,000 used EV credit ending September 30

EVs average $57,700 vs gas cars at $48,100 (Kelley Blue Book, May 2025)

Why it matters: The public feud underscores how Musk’s political activities are directly impacting Tesla’s market performance and investor confidence. For Tesla, already reeling from its CEO’s divergent focus, the elimination of tax credits threatens a demand cliff—a bitter irony given Musk’s opposition to the very legislation dealing this blow.

Watch for: September 30 deadline sparking “summer of the EV” rush; whether Musk’s America Party gains traction targeting 2-3 Senate seats and 8-10 House districts.

Sakana AI reveals team-based genAI approach to crack problems none could solve alone

The story: The Japanese AI company Sakana AI has unveiled AB-MCTS, a new algorithm that enables multiple frontier AI models such as variants of ChatGPT, Gemini and DeepSeek to collaborate and solve problems through collective intelligence. The system dynamically allocates different models based on their strengths. For instance, one might excel at strategy while another writes better code. On the challenging ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, the combined AI team solved over 30% of problems, significantly outperforming any individual model’s 23% success rate.

The numbers:

30%+ problems solved by AI collaboration vs 23% by single models

250 maximum LLM calls per problem in experiments

3 frontier models combined: o4-mini + Gemini-2.5-Pro + DeepSeek-R1

Why it matters: This research announcement shows that genAI models, like humans, can achieve more through collaboration than working alone, potentially jointly solving problems that no single model could. For instance, in one example, o4-mini’s incorrect solution became a hint that enabled the open-source DeepSeek-R1 and proprietary Gemini-2.5-Pro models to find the correct answer.

Watch for: Commercial applications where AI teams tackle enterprise problems; potential cost implications of running multiple models; whether competitors will adopt similar collaborative approaches.

Moderna’s mRNA flu vaccine shows 26.6% better protection than standard shots in Phase 3 study

The story: Moderna’s mRNA-1010 flu vaccine demonstrated superior protection compared to standard flu shots in a Phase 3 trial of 40,805 adults aged 50 and older across 11 countries, according to the company. The trial showed 26.6% better relative efficacy overall, with especially strong results for those 65+ (27.4% better).

The numbers:

26.6% better protection than standard flu vaccines (95% CI: 16.7%-35.4%)

40,805 participants aged 50+ across 11 countries

Strong efficacy against all strains: H1N1 (29.6%), H3N2 (22.2%), B/Victoria (29.1%)

Why it matters: The news promises a significant advance in flu prevention technology, using the same mRNA platform that formed the backbone for the COVID vaccination strategy in many parts of the world. The superior efficacy could significantly reduce hospitalizations among older adults most vulnerable to severe flu. The mRNA approach also enables faster strain matching and opens the door for combination COVID-flu vaccines.

Watch for: Regulatory filing timelines and potential approval dates; pricing strategy versus existing high-dose flu vaccines; whether this accelerates development of Moderna’s combination respiratory vaccines targeting flu, COVID and RSV simultaneously.

Meanwhile, open questions swirl as the vaccine approaches potential FDA approval amid unprecedented changes at the FDA and CDC. HHS Secretary RFK Jr. has dismissed the CDC’s entire vaccine advisory committee, replacing it with mostly vaccine skeptics. He has also trimmed FDA staff, including food and vaccine safety personnel. In addition, there are questions about tolerability and durability of immune response from mRNA vaccines.

Astronomers track interstellar comet

The story: NASA telescopes in Chile first spotted the object on Tuesday. More than 100 observations have been made of the comet, named 3I/ATLAS, from telescopes all over the world. Astronomers determined that the comet was moving too fast to be gravitationally bound to the sun, meaning that it originated from outside our solar system. The origins of the comet are unknown; it may be the remnant of an explosion or collision in another solar system millions of years ago. Once it leaves our solar system, its orbit indicates that it will not be back.

The numbers:

The comet is between 12 and 25 miles wide

The closest it will be to the sun is about 200 million miles, around Oct. 29

It is traveling at about 150,000 mph and could break the record for the fastest-moving visitor in our solar system

This is the third interstellar object to be observed in our solar system

Why it matters: Studying interstellar objects like this one can give scientists clues to other interstellar visitors and whether they may pose a threat to Earth. It could also help scientists learn about the formation of other star systems.

Watch for: It will reach its closest point to the sun at the end of October, a distance about twice as far as the Earth is from the sun. As it gets closer, it may also get brighter. This object was spotted early enough that astronomers will have time to make many observations before it is out of view.

A new treatment for type 1 diabetes could replace insulin injections

The story: A single infusion of lab-grown pancreatic cells allows patients’ bodies to make the necessary amount of insulin, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. One year after the treatment, 10 out of 12 patients no longer needed insulin injections. Vertex developed a method to grow pancreatic islet cells in the lab using human stem cells. The islet cells settle in the liver, not the pancreas, where they sense blood sugar levels and produce insulin. Side effects of the therapy, called zimislecel, include diarrhea, headache, nausea and COVID-19 infection. These side effects were due to immunosuppressive drugs that prevent the body from attacking and rejecting the new islet cells.

The numbers:

Over 8 million people worldwide have type 1 diabetes

10 participants no longer needed insulin injections after one full dose

2 other patients were able to reduce insulin doses by up to 70%

Why it matters: Insulin injections are not a perfect treatment. Too much insulin causes kidney, nerve and eye damage. Too little insulin can cause people to pass out or become confused. Patients can receive pancreatic cells from deceased donors, but the number of donors is limited and patients often need infusions from multiple donors. A new treatment that solves these issues could help millions of patients.",https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AdobeStock_229285539.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 20:10:09.248831

The changes all came as part of the Trump administration's ""big, beautiful bill.""

Anyone who has been on the fence about solar energy still has some time to take advantage before the cuts are official at the end of the year. But once the cuts are official, experts say everyone will be impacted — as solar cuts mean higher bills.

""Really, really dramatic impacts with these cuts,"" said Chelsea Biggs of the Illinois Environmental Council.

In Illinois, the League of Conservation Voters is estimating that homeowners will pay $168 more in energy bills a year — with a 21% increase in commercial and industrial energy bills.

But Biggs said this won't just cost consumers.

""These cuts are terrible for our climate,"" said Biggs. ""They're terrible for our economy.""

Between now and 2030, the cuts are estimated to add another 7 billion tons of emissions to the atmosphere. So what about Illinois' goal of total clean energy by 2050?

""It's going to slow us down,"" said Biggs. ""As a state, we need to reassess our plan.""

""While this is a gut punch to solar power, but it's not a knockout punch,"" added Jim Chilsen of the Citizens Utility Board. ""Illinois has very strong solar energy policy.""

The Residential Clean Energy Credit helps consumers recoup up to 30% of the costs of energy-saving projects, like installing rooftop solar. The Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated the credit.

""This is going to lead to higher power bills across the country including Illinois,"" Chilsen said.

But Chilsen said the Citizens Utility Board is currently hearing from people who think this means they've lost their chance to benefit from the Residential Clean Energy credit — and that is not the case just yet.

""That tax credit goes away on Dec. 31, 2025,"" he said. ""So if you're interested in solar, you want to explore solar for your household, you should move now.""

45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit and baseload Secs.","On Friday, July 4, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA).

The bill includes tax cuts for businesses and high income earners and significant increases in defense and border spending. The bill also includes work requirements and cuts to Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and social services. The Seattle Metro Chamber’s federal priorities—behavioral health, addiction, housing, childcare, workforce training, transportation, and environmental/education funding—are largely undercut or unaddressed. Bright spots are the renter tax credits and potential hospital fund boost, but these are marginal compared to the bill’s overall direction.

Health and opioid crisis: The bill imposes eligibility tightening and cuts to Medicaid (up to 18% to 20%) and SNAP benefits. This would reduce funding for behavioral health and addiction treatment programs that rely on Medicaid/SNAP support and could reduce or remove coverage for thousands in Seattle.

Housing supply crisis and childcare affordability: The bill has a renter’s tax credit and expands the Child & Dependent Care Tax Credit, which will provide tax-based relief. This will help renters and families, addressing affordability indirectly. But it does not provide direct federal funding for shelter or workforce housing.

Tax cuts for small businesses: The bill extends the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions increasing deductions for qualified business income, adds deductions for tip income and overtime pay, and raises the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 for some filers. Taken together, these provide modest tax relief for small business owners, particularly those in hospitality and service industries.

Research education and natural resources: The bill offers cuts to non-defense spending that will likely lead to reductions in energy, education and agency funding. This threatens federal support for higher education, research and development, and national parks.

What’s next?

Regulations

Given the many new policies and some significant changes to existing law included, this new law will result in many IRS/Treasury guidance and regulatory projects over the coming months (some projects statutorily mandated). We should begin seeing signals from the Trump Administration soon on which projects will be prioritized. Some of these projects will include:

No Tax on Tips

No Tax on Overtime

Biofuels/SAF (Sec. 45Z)

Advanced Manufacturing/FEOC/domestic content (Sec. 45X and other credits)

Tech-Neutral Credit (Secs. 45Y/48E) commence construction for wind and solar

Agriculture Lending (ACRE Act)

International tax regimes

As with any regulatory effort, this process will provide formal comment and testimony opportunities for companies and trade associations. Perhaps more importantly, the relationships developed on Capitol Hill during the crafting of this bill should help provide champions for individual issues, especially with tax committee members, as those committees have jurisdiction over the IRS and Treasury. Other committees, like those with jurisdiction over Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Agriculture will have input on the clean energy incentives, like Foreign Entity of Concern and Clean Fuel Protection Credit. Engaging with these offices and departments early and throughout the regulatory process, in addition to administration officials, can help deliver favorable rules.

Future Legislative Opportunities

The congressional and administration relationships built over the last year, in addition to the demonstrable economic activity to result from the certainty following bill enactment, can also help serve as a momentum-builder for extensions or positive revisions of incentives impacted by this bill. There will be many opportunities over the next 3.5 years to address tax policy – some the result of actively-developed legislation, and some driven by the impending expiration of certain provisions.

In the immediate term, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) has signaled his intention to not “rest on his laurels” after this tax package passes. He intends to pursue bipartisan tax legislation in late 2025 or 2026 to address bipartisan issues that were not addressed in this bill. He has demonstrated the ability to reach across the aisle when he and then-Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) worked on a bill together last year. Bipartisan legislation could also be possible in the next Congress (2027-28) if Democrats win a majority in the House.

If bipartisan legislation is not on the table, House Speaker Mike Johnson has indicated his willingness to do another reconciliation bill. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate could again develop a bill under the reconciliation process once the current fiscal year ends on Oct. 1. Of course, a new partisan reconciliation bill could present further risks to some policies like clean energy incentives as they seek revenue offsets.

Other annual legislation, like the budget/Continuing Resolution (CR) and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) sometimes serve as tax policy vehicles. Also, depending on the policy issue, pending legislation such as permitting reform (perhaps for critical minerals) or the Farm Bill (perhaps for Sec. 45Z) could potentially carry tax provisions.

In addition to the more proactive opportunities outlined above, the expiration of certain tax policies can help build the momentum for tax legislation. Below are some upcoming dates that are worth looking at:

Balance of 2025: Permitting reform, Fix Our Forests Act, National Defense Authorization Act, CR, potential beginnings of bipartisan or new reconciliation tax bill

Late 2026: Surface Transportation Act (Highway Bill) Reauthorization and Medicaid Work Requirements implementation date

Depending on the political climate, a package including delay of Medicaid work requirements may provide an avenue for extenders or changes to other tax policy.

Lame-Duck (Post-midterm elections) 2026: In addition to policy drivers above, if one or both chambers switch parties, there may be a rush to get a bill done while Republicans still have the pen.

Late 2027: Wind, solar, hydrogen, wind Manufacturing Production Credits expiring

Extensions at this time depend on which party controls House and Senate. Should Democrats reclaim the House in the 2026 Midterm Elections, they will have some leverage to push for extension of IRA energy tax provisions expiring in 2027, likely as part of the CR.

Late 2028: FAA Reauthorization, No Tax on Tips/Overtime expire, Debt Limit

The confluence of state and local tax deduction cap, No Tax on Tips, and No Tax on Overtime – in addition to Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization – may create the conditions for significant tax package – likely during the post-election lame-duck session in December 2028. Additionally, the $5 trillion increase to the debt limit is anticipated to last through 2028, though the specific date will not be known for a little while.

Late 2029: State and local tax deduction cap deal expires (reverts to 10%), Sec. 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and metallurgical coal 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit incentive expire (both are Republican priorities)

After December 2030: Sec. 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit and baseload Secs. 45Y Clean Electricity Production Credits/48E Clean Electricity Investment Credits phasedowns to begin

Section 45X’s Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit phaseout is set to begin after 2030, leaving December 2030 as the likely deadline for advocacy focusing on an extension of that tax credit. 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit did not see any new inclusions (aside from designating metallurgical coal as a critical mineral), and this may provide an opportunity for other mined or refined materials or new technologies to become eligible for the credit – including hydrogen or nuclear

Other legislation not named in the list above that could carry a tax title could include a reconciliation bill (as discussed), a China competitiveness bill, a stimulus/infrastructure bill (depending on the economy), a future Water Bill (WRDA) or Farm Bill, and, as mentioned, the yearly National Defense Authorization Act and budget/CR.

“It looked like we had an off-ramp to 2032 to see these tax credits dissipate,” he said.
Instantly removing these tax credits at the end of the year is gonna be extremely detrimental.","On Thursday July 3, the House of Representatives passed the budget bill, known as the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ which included sweeping cuts to renewable energy tax credits and programs.

The bill claws back funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration’s landmark climate legislation, and changes or cuts energy and manufacturing tax credits. For example, solar and wind energy that are built and come online after 2027 will no longer be eligible for tax credits, significantly reducing the timeline for any projects to get off the ground.

The oil and gas industry, as well as mining, come out ahead in the bill. It reduces royalty rates that operators pay for oil and gas production on federal lands, and includes leasing mandates for federal land and water. There’s also a mandatory expansion of federal land to be made available for mining.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, solar and battery storage made up over 80% of the nation’s new electric generating capacity in 2024. That trend is expected to continue into 2025, with officials saying solar will be driving much of the growth in capacity.

Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) said during a virtual press conference on July 2 that some of the more harmful provisions in the Senate’s bill, like an excise tax on solar panels, were removed, but still, the economic impacts of rescinding tax credits would be devastating.

“We’re going to gut hundreds of billions of dollars in the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy investments,” he said. “This (was) a transformational moment to address climate change, and we weren’t solving it, but this was a major step towards addressing climate change, and now… it’s like running into a brick wall.”

“We got over 8 thousand solar jobs, just in Colorado,” he said.

Nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation (EI) says these cuts will mean less capacity for the nation’s increasingly strained power grid. The group estimates that by 2030, there will be a 340 gigawatt decrease in generation capacity.

Sara Baldwin, the group’s senior electrification director, says this could harm fast-growing regions like the Mountain West.

“We would see a net loss of generation capacity that we would have otherwise seen built by 2035 in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, to the tune of eight gigawatts,” she said. That’s enough energy to power 6 million homes.

EI estimates that because of the increasing reliance on coal and fossil fuels, the nation’s emissions would go up by 160 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2030, or the equivalent of adding 72 million cars to the road. Baldwin says for mountain areas like the Front Range and the Wasatch Front, which struggle with poor air quality, public health would be threatened.

Baldwin says many of the tax credits the bill cuts have been in place for decades, but the IRA expanded their reach, and added supplemental programs. She estimates that across the three states, there would be a loss of over 17,000 jobs by the year 2030.

“When you take something like a longstanding production and investment tax credit away from these businesses that are trying to create jobs in America, you are telling them that you do not respect the business that they have, and you do not want them to do that job creation here in the U.S.”

On average, EI estimates that Colorado and Utah households would see an increase in yearly utility costs of about $300. That number is about $150 in Wyoming.

Josh Shipley owns a small solar company, Alternative Power Enterprises, in Ridgway and Montrose, and he participated in Hickenlooper’s press call on the impacts of the bill.

“It looked like we had an off-ramp to 2032 to see these tax credits dissipate,” he said. “That was imperative in our business plan. That was part of how we were able to afford to continue on this company of now 30+ years. Instantly removing these tax credits at the end of the year is gonna be extremely detrimental. We actually don’t believe we’re going to be able to stay in business.”

Shipley says his business is one of just two installers in the area, and this could hurt the community’s ability to lower their energy costs. He says tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act have allowed his business to expand, helping people on the Western Slope reduce their energy costs.

“In the last handful of years, we’ve actually been able to start helping low income families be able to go solar,” he said. “I think in the last three years, over 120 families have benefitted from that.”

Sara Baldwin says the bill essentially takes the country back in time to a previous era.

E-bikes have an electric motor that runs off of a rechargeable battery.
The electric motor distinguishes e-bikes from mopeds with gasoline engines.
Robin Green of the Lafayette Police Department advises riders to use available bike paths for a safer experience.
""There’s a lot of bike paths, so we strongly encourage them to utilize the paths if they are available,"" Sgt.","LAFAYETTE, La. — If you drive around the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's campus or downtown Lafayette, you’ve likely noticed the increasing presence of e-bikes and e-scooters cruising along the streets.

These electric vehicles have become a popular mode of transportation for many, including UL student Dwayne Thompson, who relies on them to make his commute to class more efficient.

Thompson, a junior at UL Lafayette, has been riding his e-bike for about two years.

""It kind of helps me get to class,"" he says. ""Maybe I’ll leave the house at 10:10 and my class is at 10:20 and I'm able to get there in five minutes versus where I would be late a lot of the time if I did wake up late.”

According to Laborde Earles, a law firm in the Hub City, Louisiana legalized electric scooters in 2019, allowing users to operate them on sidewalks, bicycle paths, and streets where the speed limit is 25 mph or less.

The Louisiana Legislature amended its laws to treat e-bikes as bicycles. E-bikes have an electric motor that runs off of a rechargeable battery. The electric motor distinguishes e-bikes from mopeds with gasoline engines.

Under Louisiana law, e-bikes fall into three classes:

Class I has an electric motor to assist the cyclist up to 20 miles per hour

Class II has an electric motor to propel the bicycle up to 20 miles per hour

Class III has an electric motor to assist the cyclist up to 28 miles per hour

All classes of e-bikes qualify as bicycles and fall under the state's bike laws, according to People Powered Movement.

Sgt. Robin Green of the Lafayette Police Department advises riders to use available bike paths for a safer experience.

""There’s a lot of bike paths, so we strongly encourage them to utilize the paths if they are available,"" Sgt. Green said. ""If there is no shoulder or no bike path, we asked them to obey the traffic laws when utilizing the roadway.""

Green also emphasized safety tips for those using motorized bikes or scooters on the roadways or sidewalks:

Wear a helmet

Avoid distractions like using a cellphone or wearing headphones

Be aware of your surroundings and take a second to look around before accelerating

Be mindful of road conditions

For Thompson, the choice to ride an e-bike is practical.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b497965/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf.cdn.uplynk.com%2Fause1%2Fslices%2Ff86%2Ff777e7b891e1459dabc1eab38a649e4f%2Ff866e0f6fc24445cab65da0576faf2ea%2Fposter_02cd2301b1d04338bd6155614641bafb.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 19:12:29.052989

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“Act”), passed in the House of Representatives on July 3, 2025, by a 218-214 vote. This Act makes significant changes to the federal tax law and builds upon the foundation established by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). The TCJA, which was enacted during President Trump’s first term on January 1, 2018, introduced comprehensive tax reform focused on tax cuts and a variety of other benefits for individuals and businesses. Many TCJA provisions were scheduled to expire in 2025. The Act extends many TCJA provisions and includes other significant revisions to the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”).

The Act was passed pursuant to the budget reconciliation process, which allowed it to pass the Senate with a simple majority and without the possibility of a filibuster. After a narrow vote in the House, the Senate modified parts of the bill and approved it with Vice President J.D. Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. The use of reconciliation limited the number of amendments and expedited the timeline, resulting in a relatively swift legislative journey. Supporters view the Act as a continuation and expansion of earlier tax reform efforts, aiming to stimulate economic growth and simplify the tax system. Critics, however, have raised concerns about its potential impact on the federal deficit and the reduction of public assistance programs. The Act’s passage reflects broader debates about tax policy, government spending, and the country’s long-term fiscal direction. Below is a summary of the key tax provisions of the Act.

Key Tax Items

Individual Income Tax Rates: The reduced statutory income tax rates established by the TCJA are made permanent, with an additional year of inflation adjustments applied to the 10%, 12%, and 22% income tax brackets.

Standard Deduction: The TCJA’s near doubling of the standard deduction is made permanent. For 2025, the deduction is $31,500 for joint filers, $23,625 for heads of household, and $15,750 for all other filers, with amounts adjusted for inflation annually.

Personal Exemptions: The elimination of personal exemptions under TCJA is made permanent.

Child Tax Credit: The TCJA’s child tax credit is made permanent. The maximum credit for qualifying taxpayers will be $2,200 in 2026, which is adjusted for inflation each year.

Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT): The increase in the alternative minimum tax exemption is made permanent. The exemption phaseout thresholds have been reset to their 2018 levels: $500,000 for single filers and $1 million for joint filers, with adjustments for inflation going forward. Additionally, the AMT phaseout rate has been increased.

Pass-Through Business Deduction: The Code Section 199A pass-through deduction is made permanent. The income limitation phase-in range has been expanded by $50,000 for individual filers and $100,000 for those filing jointly. Additionally, a minimum deduction of $400 is now available to taxpayers who materially participate in a business and report at least $1,000 in qualified business income.

Estate and Gift Tax Exemption: The estate and gift tax exemption amounts under the TCJA are made permanent. Starting in 2026, the estate and gift tax exemption will be $15 million indexed for inflation each year thereafter, permitting a total $30 million exemption available to married individuals in 2026 for estate planning purposes.

State and Local Taxes (SALT): The cap on the itemized deduction for state and local taxes has been temporarily raised to $40,000 for 2025, with a 1% annual increase through 2029. This enhanced cap is subject to a phaseout for taxpayers earning more than $500,000. Beginning in 2030, the cap will return to a flat $10,000.

Bonus Depreciation: Full expensing (100% bonus depreciation) for certain business investments is restored and made permanent.

Research and Development Expensing: Immediate expensing for domestic research and development costs has been permanently reinstated. Small businesses with gross receipts of $31 million or less are allowed to retroactively expense research and development expenditures incurred after December 31, 2021. A small business will satisfy the gross receipts test as provided in Code Section 448(c)(1) if the average annual gross receipts of the entity for the prior three taxable years do not exceed $31 million. For all other domestic research and development conducted between December 31, 2021, and January 1, 2025, remaining deductions can be accelerated over a one- or two-year period.

Section 179 Expensing: The expanded Section 179 increased dollar limitations for expensing of certain depreciable business assets are made permanent.

Interest Deduction Limitation: The more generous limits on business interest deductions (based on EBITDA) are restored and made permanent.

Qualified Small Business Stock: The Act significantly expands the benefits of Code Section 1202 related to Qualified Small Business Stock (“QSBS”) by allowing for gain exclusions of 50%, 75% and 100% for shares held for more than three years, four years, and five years, respectively. The gain exclusion limit is increased from $10 million to $15 million per issuer, and the corporate-level gross asset ceiling increases from $50 million to $75 million.

New Middle-Class Tax Relief

“No Tax on Tips”: For tax years 2025–2028, the Act provides an “above-the-line deduction” (adjustment) for tips with a maximum of $25,000 that decreases for individuals making more than $150,000 a year, $300,000 for joint filers.

“No Tax on Overtime”: For tax years 2025–2028, the Act provides an “above-the-line deduction” (adjustment) on overtime pay from taxable income with a maximum of $12,500 that decreases for individuals making more than $150,000 a year. For joint filers, the deduction is capped at $25,000 with an income cutoff of $300,000.

Deduction for Car Loan Interest: For tax years 2025–2028, the Act provides a deduction up to $10,000 on new car loan interest for vehicles assembled in the U.S., subject to income-based phaseouts.

Enhanced Deduction for Seniors: For tax years 2025-2028, the Act provides a new “above-the-line deduction” (adjustment) for seniors of $6,000, who earn no more than $75,000 per year or $150,000 for joint filers.

Trump Accounts: The Act provides for new individual retirement accounts for qualifying children to be used for qualified expenses, with annual contributions up to $5,000, indexed for inflation. For U.S. citizens born after 2024 and before 2029, the Act provides for a credit to established accounts with an initial government contribution of $1,000.

Charitable and Other Deductions

“Above-the-Line Charitable Deduction”: The Act provides a permanent “deduction” (adjustment) up to $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for joint filers who do not itemize for charitable contributions.

0.5% Floor on Charitable Deductions: The Act establishes a new 0.5% floor on charitable contributions made by individuals in order to take them as itemized deductions.

Itemized Deductions: Corporate and individual deductions were limited. The corporate charitable deduction allowed pursuant to Section 170(b)(2)(A) was amended to include a minimum floor amount. A corporation can deduct charitable contributions if they exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income and may deduct amounts up to 10% of taxable income. The amount of itemized deductions allowed for an individual was reduced by 2/37ths of the lesser of: (1) such amount of itemized deductions, or (2) the amount of taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year that exceeds the dollar amount at which the 37% tax rate bracket begins with respect to the taxpayer.

Further, miscellaneous itemized deductions, other than the deduction for educator expenses, were permanently abolished. The deduction for personal casualty losses in Section 165(h)(5) was amended to make the time limitation permanent. The moving expense deduction provided in Section 217(g) was expanded to apply to employees or new appointees of the intelligence community who move due to a change in assignment that requires relocation.

Repeal and Phase-Out of Green Energy Credits: A wind or solar facility placed in service after December 31, 2027, will not qualify for the clean electricity production credit. Numerous clean energy credits were terminated, including the Clean Vehicle Credit, the Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit, the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit, the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, and the Residential Clean Energy Credit.

Opportunity Zones: The opportunity zones tax incentive was made permanent. The eligibility requirements for census tracts were tightened, and new tracts will be designated every 10 years beginning December 1, 2027. Gain invested in a qualified opportunity fund on or after January 1, 2027, will be eligible for deferral until December 31, 2033, and gain invested on or after January 1, 2034, will be eligible for deferral until December 31, 2043, and so forth for 10-year periods.

Business Credits: The advanced manufacturing investment credit was increased from 25% to 35% of the qualified investment for the taxable year for an advanced manufacturing facility. The depreciation deduction provided in Section 167(a) now allows for the full depreciation of qualified production property, up to the adjusted basis, for the year the property is placed into service.

International Tax Reforms: The foreign-derived intangible income and global intangible low-taxed income deductions were reduced from 37.5% and 50%, respectively, to 33.34% and 40%. The base erosion minimum tax amount will be calculated using the amount equal to the excess of 10.5% of modified taxable income, increased from 10%.",https://www.dykema.com/a/web/3Y6EBxRqmkT6tMJQpq3Zh1/avy9Pu/us-capitol-building-preview.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 22:05:33.703643

Automakers are rethinking their roadmaps that had put them on a path toward full electrification. Electric vehicle adoption is slowing in the United States, and the federal tax incentives are set to disappear soon. That makes pouring billions of dollars into EV development even riskier for already strained auto companies, and that uncertainty is forcing some, like Honda, to pull the plug on developing some future models.

The automaker has reportedly canceled plans for a large electric SUV. It was supposed to launch in 2027, but according to a new report from Nikkei Asia, Honda has halted development on the model and slashed how much it plans to spend on EVs through 2030.

Photo by: Honda

According to the publication, Honda will cut EV-related funding from ¥10 trillion ($68.6 billion at today's exchange rate) to ¥7 trillion ($48.0 billion). However, it's still planning to launch the flagship electric sedan and midsize SUV EVs that it showcased earlier this year with the 0 Series concepts (pictured above). They're scheduled to arrive next year.

Honda had plans to launch seven EVs by 2030, but it's unclear how many of those are still in development. The automaker is reportedly shifting its focus to building more hybrids, which are already in development for America.

The EV Pullback and the Combustion Comeback

In the last six to nine months, automotive companies have had an epiphany and realized their EV plans don't align with consumer demand. In November 2024, Lotus canceled its proposal to go fully electric by 2028. Instead, it will focus on hybrids, like Honda, and that's the direction many automakers are now heading.

Porsche also announced it would shift to offering more hybrid options, admitting it would not achieve its initial goal of 80 percent of its sales to be fully electric by 2030. However, the German brand said it would continue to expand its EV lineup. Nissan scrapped plans for a small electric SUV in January, and in April, Mini said it wouldn't abandon gasoline engines anytime soon.

Even Volvo has admitted defeat in achieving its EV plans.

And then there are the companies trying to keep the combustion engines alive. BMW said the combustion engine is its ""foundation."" Lamborghini is hopeful that synthetic fuels will happen, as its new V-8 can run on them without sacrificing performance. Mercedes-Benz is making a ""course correction"" to extend the life of its engines, and Audi has announced it will now build gas engines for another 10 years.

If 2025 has proven anything, it's that the auto industry is facing a massive upheaval, and automakers are scrambling to navigate an ever-changing landscape unlike anything they have ever seen. Competition from China on electric vehicles is putting Western automakers in a difficult position as EV adoption begins to falter elsewhere. Plans are changing, and that means some automakers are closing the purse strings on EV investments as things change.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/rKEw99/s1/honda-0-saloon-and-suv.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 19:10:33.439698

In December 2024, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the nation’s reliability monitor, issued an assessment that stated that the reliability risk for 2025-2029 in 11 of the 20 reliability areas was “elevated to high.” And that was before AI suddenly loomed as a big taker of electricity. AI has destabilizing characteristics, incidentally, so it doesn’t help the reliability picture.

In Europe, in recent days suffering a heat wave, several nuclear power stations had to shut down because the river water used for reactor cooling was too warm. We doubt this sort of situation was taken into account in the planning of the nukes, and we doubt its contemplation is in those reliability numbers. Who would have thought….? And it will be even harder to think of it in a country where climate change has been declared officially nonexistent, more or less.

A few days later, the head of Hitachi Energy, the world’s largest manufacturer of electric transformers predicted a shortage of transformers over the coming three years. Transformers control the voltage where the generator attaches to the transmission network and where the transmission network attaches to the distribution network. Talk about a quintessential equipment bottleneck! The Hitachi CEO also commented that AI centers would contribute enormous variability to grid demand and might require permission to operate during certain periods. Everyone wants an AI center in the neighborhood. Do they want what comes with it?

We cannot predict what natural event unexpected by the industry will affect service, or whether some Silicon Valley techie will discover a cheap substitute made in the USA for a transformer. but we can advise that if your organization will need a large block of reliable power in the future, don’t bet on the grid, and don’t bet on fusion energy which is a minimum of five years out, just get to work on it yourselves. The electricity industry may be too busy searching for transformers and ice cubes.

,Texas Environment,2025-07-07 21:53:53+00:00,Miami Herald,Texas and Florida floods show climate change's deadly effects | Miami Herald,Denise Hruby,,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/climate-change/article310145585.html,"And, despite the sheer speed with which these floods took people by surprise, they have another thing in common: Climate change made them even more catastrophic.
Heavier rainfalls likely made the Texas flooding “even more unprecedented,” said Winkley, who taught at Texas A&M University.
In Miami, Climate Central’s analysis, which is based on NOAA data, found that the hourly rainfall intensity increased by 12 percent.
That makes adaptation a necessity, especially in places like South Florida, where a lot of infrastructure dates back to the 1950s.
And while Florida was less susceptible to river flooding due to its lack of hills, the Texas flood, he said, was “a warning for everybody.”","As the Texas flooding death toll reached 95 on Monday — at least 27 of them children — and Tropical Storm Chantal prompted dozens of water rescues in North Carolina, some Floridians were reminded of the disastrous “rain bomb” in 2023 that hit faster and harder than any hurricane in living memory.

Though no one died from the 2 feet of rain that deluged Fort Lauderdale in a single day in April two years ago, the relentless rain forced hundreds to flee to Red Cross shelters, covered airport runways, filled the tunnel that runs under the New River and turned downtown streets into raging rivers.

And, despite the sheer speed with which these floods took people by surprise, they have another thing in common: Climate change made them even more catastrophic.

While the tropical system stuck over Texas’ Hill Country — also known as “Flash Flood Alley” — was expected to cause flooding, “we also know that climate change is adding just a little bit of extra rain,” Shel Winkley, who worked as a broadcast meteorologist for a CBS-affiliate in Texas, told the Miami Herald.

Overall, the climate is now 1.3 degrees Celsius warmer than before humans started burning fossil fuels, which releases greenhouse gases that trap heat within the atmosphere. The warmer the atmosphere, the more moisture it can hold, and, consequently, release.

Heavier rainfalls likely made the Texas flooding “even more unprecedented,” said Winkley, who taught at Texas A&M University. “The question is, would it have come down as fast, and would the river have risen as quickly as it did, without that climate change influence?”

Using a rapid analysis to show how the floods are linked to climate change, scientists in Europe determined that warmer weather fueled the Texas disaster as overall weather conditions in that specific region had gotten wetter compared to the past. The severity of the event, they said, can’t be explained by naturally occurring changes to the climate and weather.

Research by Climate Central, a nonprofit science and communications group, also found that, over the past 50 years, rainfall has become heavier in cities like San Antonio, some 60 miles south of the worst flooding, with rainfalls now increased by 6 percent.

In Miami, Climate Central’s analysis, which is based on NOAA data, found that the hourly rainfall intensity increased by 12 percent.

Both Florida and Texas are adversely affected because they lie on the Gulf of Mexico, which is currently between 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average for the beginning of July, conditions that are 10 to 30 times more likely because of climate change.

This extra heat has given more water molecules the energy they need to “escape” from the surface and evaporate into the atmosphere, where they’re supplying additional moisture, which makes rainfall more intense.

“Climate change loads the dice toward more frequent and more intense floods,” Davide Farranda, an expert on extreme weather events at the French National Center for Scientific Research, said in a statement, adding that the Texas flood “shows the deadly cost of underestimating this shift.”

“We need to rethink early warning systems, land-use planning, and emergency preparedness. And above all, we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit future risks,” he said.

While cutting greenhouse gas emissions is the only proven solution that can stop things from getting even worse, our atmosphere and oceans react slowly to the CO2 we’re emitting. The impact of the fossil fuels burnt today will be felt in decades to come.

That makes adaptation a necessity, especially in places like South Florida, where a lot of infrastructure dates back to the 1950s.

“These extreme events are likely to become more frequent,” said Ben Kirtman, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami, referring to the 2023 rain bomb, which overwhelmed Fort Lauderdale with such a sudden deluge that schools had to shut down for two days.

A 1-in-500-year flood, he said, referring to a flood that, statistically speaking, is so devastating it occurs once every 500 years, “that will maybe be a 1-in-a-100-year flood, or a 1-in-20-year flood,” Kirtman said.

Cities, he said, need to know what to plan for, so infrastructure can be hardened, and at least some catastrophes can be avoided.

Figuring out not just how much rainfall we can expect, but also the frequency and duration of rainfall is exactly what Kirtman and colleagues from across Florida, including the US Geological Service, are trying to figure out.

Six inches of rainfall might not be a lot for a city like Miami, but it wouldn’t be able to handle six inches of rain over three, four or five days. Within a year, he and his colleagues hope to have some preliminary data.

Even with that data, keeping people and properties safe from ever heavier flooding can simply prove too costly. Miami, for example, would have had to pay $5.1 billion to upgrade its infrastructure for a 1-in-10-year storm, an extra $1.3 billion compared to adapting for a 1-in-5-year storm. The city tried to find a middle ground, upgrading some projects to higher and others to lower levels.

Though Floridians are used to storms, heavy rain and flooding, being surrounded by a warmer Gulf on all sides and the fact that hurricanes have already become more intense doesn’t bode well, Winkley said. And while Florida was less susceptible to river flooding due to its lack of hills, the Texas flood, he said, was “a warning for everybody.”",https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/jkj81u/picture310155460/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/sipa_62610322.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 18:16:35.480351

The EPA will spend several weeks removing PCBs and other materials used in manufacturing before being phased out due to the health hazards they present.

What we know:

The city of Detroit has spent years working on the Joe Louis Greenway, which will one day be a nearly-30-mile path around the city, moving through both Highland Park and Hamtramck as well as along the city's famous riverfront.

Part of the work is on pause because of contaminated soil found in a vacant lot at 8013 W. Chicago. The location is just north of where the trail has already been paved.

After being requested to take a look, the EPA confirmed elevated levels of Polychlorinated biphenyls within a 400-foot by 90-foot area on the property.

The EPA plans to transport the contaminated soil off-site before Detroit can truck in new soil that will serve as the foundation for the future greenway.

The clean-up is expected to take four to five weeks.

What are PCBs?

Local perspective:

PCBs were outlawed in 1979 after being used in U.S. manufacturing for 50 years.

The chemicals are man-made and used because they didn't catch on fire, were highly stable, and insulated electrical currents. Their applications were wide, stretching from electrical and hydraulic equipment to paint products.

Most of America’s transmission lines are more than 50 years old, and date back to the 1950-60s. The American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid a D+ grade. As we use more electronics, build new factories, and continue to grow AI data centers, our electricity demand increases. But our outdated grid cannot keep up.

When the grid fails, it’s not just an inconvenience. Blackouts mean straining hospitals, fire departments, and police, as well as safety threats and lack of heating and cooling during extreme weather. Recent tornados and high winds across the central US this year have shown how a weak grid can leave communities without power for days. Expanded transmission strengthens the grid against extreme weather by creating alternative pathways for electricity to move, giving us the flexibility to handle emergencies by moving electricity from where it’s available to where it’s needed most.

Energy storage also plays a critical role. When used as a transmission and distribution asset, storage can relieve congestion on overloaded lines, provide backup during outages, and reduce the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. By storing electricity during periods of low demand and discharging it when demand spikes or outages occur, storage supports grid stability and enhances resilience.

More transmission also improves efficiency by easing power transfer between regions to meet demand. When power can’t move easily between regions, areas with high demand cannot access cheaper power, leaving households and businesses with higher bills. Expanded transmission networks are the backbone of a strong, affordable, and reliable energy system, letting us tap into the cheapest sources of power. New transmission also makes it easier to bring new resources online, presenting an all-of-the-above opportunity for various energy sources to serve consumers across the country.

Building new or expanded transmission lines not only increases reliability and resiliency, it creates good-paying jobs. Over one million Americans are currently employed in transmission, distribution and storage. Expanding transmission will create jobs in construction, maintenance, and operation. Reliable transmission also attracts manufacturing and new businesses, creating economic growth and job opportunities.

Today, building new transmission lines is slow and complicated, often tangled in red tape between states and regions. We need to update the rules so projects can move forward quickly and fairly. A stronger grid means fewer blackouts, lower bills, and more jobs. It’s a win for families, businesses, and our entire economy. Let’s invest in America’s future by investing in the power network we all depend on.",https://feeds.newsusa.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_size_rss_feed/public/2025-07/shutterstock_134011310.jpg?itok=WeIMvpxY,N,,2025-07-07 22:06:09.632948

Solar + wind are >22% of US utility-scale generating capacity The installed capacities of solar (11.0%) and wind (11.8%) are now each more than a tenth of the US total.
Moreover, at least 25-30% of US solar capacity is in small-scale (e.g., rooftop) systems that are not reflected in FERC’s data.
Including that additional solar capacity would bring the share provided by solar + wind to more than a quarter of the US total.
If small-scale solar capacity is included, renewables are now about one-third of total US generating capacity.","Solar and wind accounted for almost 96% of new US electrical generating capacity added in the first third of 2025. In April, solar provided 87% of new capacity, making it the 20th consecutive month solar has taken the lead, according to data belatedly posted on July 1 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign.

Solar’s new generating capacity in April 2025 and YTD

In its latest monthly “Energy Infrastructure Update” report (with data through April 30, 2025), FERC says 50 “units” of solar totaling 2,284 megawatts (MW) were placed into service in April, accounting for 86.7% of all new generating capacity added during the month.

In addition, the 9,451 MW of solar added during the first four months of 2025 was 77.7% of the new generation placed into service.

Solar has now been the largest source of new generating capacity added each month for 20 consecutive months, from September 2023 to April 2025.

Solar + wind were >95% of new capacity in 1st third of 2025

Between January and April 2025, new wind provided 2,183 MW of capacity additions, accounting for 18.0% of new additions in the first third.

In the same period, the combination of solar and wind was 95.7% of new capacity while natural gas (511 MW) provided just 4.2%; the remaining 0.1% came from oil (11 MW).

Solar + wind are >22% of US utility-scale generating capacity

The installed capacities of solar (11.0%) and wind (11.8%) are now each more than a tenth of the US total. Together, they make up almost one-fourth (22.8%) of the US’s total available installed utility-scale generating capacity.

Moreover, at least 25-30% of US solar capacity is in small-scale (e.g., rooftop) systems that are not reflected in FERC’s data. Including that additional solar capacity would bring the share provided by solar + wind to more than a quarter of the US total.

With the inclusion of hydropower (7.7%), biomass (1.1%), and geothermal (0.3%), renewables currently claim a 31.8% share of total US utility-scale generating capacity. If small-scale solar capacity is included, renewables are now about one-third of total US generating capacity.

Solar is on track to become No. 2 source of US generating capacity

FERC reports that net “high probability” additions of solar between May 2025 and April 2028 total 90,158 MW – an amount almost four times the forecast net “high probability” additions for wind (22,793 MW), the second-fastest growing resource. Notably, both three-year projections are higher than those provided just a month earlier.

FERC also foresees net growth for hydropower (596 MW) and geothermal (92 MW) but a decrease of 123 MW in biomass capacity.

Taken together, the net new “high probability” capacity additions by all renewable energy sources over the next three years – i.e., the bulk of the Trump administration’s remaining time in office – would total 113,516 MW.

FERC doesn’t include any nuclear capacity in its three-year forecast, while coal and oil are projected to contract by 24,373 MW and 1,915 MW, respectively. Natural gas capacity would expand by 5,730 MW.

Thus, adjusting for the different capacity factors of gas (59.7%), wind (34.3%), and utility-scale solar (23.4%), electricity generated by the projected new solar capacity to be added in the coming three years should be at least six times greater than that produced by the new natural gas capacity, while the electrical output by new wind capacity would be more than double that by gas.

If FERC’s current “high probability” additions materialize, by May 1, 2028, solar will account for one-sixth (16.6%) of US installed utility-scale generating capacity. Wind would provide an additional one-eighth (12.6%) of the total. That would make each greater than coal (12.2%) and substantially more than nuclear power or hydropower (7.3% and 7.2%, respectively).

In fact, assuming current growth rates continue, the installed capacity of utility-scale solar is likely to surpass that of either coal or wind within two years, placing solar in second place for installed generating capacity, behind only natural gas.

Renewables + small-scale solar may overtake natural gas within 3 years

The mix of all utility-scale (ie, >1 MW) renewables is now adding about two percentage points each year to its share of generating capacity. At that pace, by May 1, 2028, renewables would account for 37.7% of total available installed utility-scale generating capacity – rapidly approaching that of natural gas (40.1%). Solar and wind would constitute more than three-quarters of installed renewable energy capacity. If those trend lines continue, utility-scale renewable energy capacity should surpass that of natural gas in 2029 or sooner.

However, as noted, FERC’s data do not account for the capacity of small-scale solar systems. If that’s factored in, within three years, total US solar capacity could exceed 300 GW. In turn, the mix of all renewables would then be about 40% of total installed capacity while the share of natural gas would drop to about 38%.

Moreover, FERC reports that there may actually be as much as 224,426 MW of net new solar additions in the current three-year pipeline in addition to 69,530 MW of new wind, 9,072 MW of new hydropower, 202 MW of new geothermal, and 39 MW of new biomass. By contrast, net new natural gas capacity potentially in the three-year pipeline totals just 26,818 MW. Consequently, renewables’ share could be even greater by mid-spring 2028.

“The Trump Administration’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ … poses a clear threat to solar and wind in the years to come,” noted the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director, Ken Bossong. “Nonetheless, FERC’s latest data and forecasts suggest cleaner and lower-cost renewable energy sources may still dominate and surpass nuclear power, coal, and natural gas.”

,Texas Environment,2025-07-07 21:44:07+00:00,www.bbc.com,Did US government cuts contribute to the Texas tragedy? - BBC,"Ben Chu, Jake Horton, Kayla Epstein & Marco Silva",,,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyndrwz00xo,"This would take effect in the 2026 financial year which begins in October this year - so these particular cuts would not have contributed to the Texas tragedy.
Despite this, climate experts told BBC Verify that the NWS forecasts and flood warnings last week in Texas were as adequate as could be expected.
However, some experts have suggested that staffing cuts may have impeded the ability of local NWS offices in Texas to effectively co-ordinate with local emergency services.
The San Angelo and San Antonio offices, which cover the areas affected by the flooding, reportedly had some existing vacancies.
For example, the San Antonio office's website lists several positions as being vacant, including two meteorologists.","In the aftermath of the fatal Texas floods, some Democrats have warned about the ""consequences"" of the Trump administration's cuts to the federal government workforce, including meteorologists, with Senator Chris Murphy saying that: ""Accurate weather forecasting helps avoid fatal disasters.""

The suggestion is that the cuts may have impeded the ability of the National Weather Service (NWS) - the government agency which provides weather forecasts in the US - to adequately predict the floods and raise the alarm.

But the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday: ""These offices [of the NWS] were well staffed… so any claims to the contrary are completely false.""

BBC Verify has examined the impact of cuts under President Trump in this area and while there has been a reduction in the workforce at the NWS, experts who we spoke to said the staffing on hand for the Texas floods appears to have been adequate.

The Trump administration has proposed a 25% cut to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) current annual budget of $6.1bn (£4.4bn). NOAA is the agency which oversees the NWS.

This would take effect in the 2026 financial year which begins in October this year - so these particular cuts would not have contributed to the Texas tragedy.

However, the staffing levels of the NWS have already been separately reduced by the Trump administration's efficiency drive since January.

The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), previously run by Elon Musk, offered voluntary redundancies, known as buyouts, as well as early retirements to federal government workers. It also ended the contracts of most of those who were on probation.

As a result, about 200 people at the NWS took voluntary redundancy and 300 opted for early retirement, according to Tom Fahy, the director of the NWS union. A further 100 people were ultimately fired from the service, he said.

In total, the NWS lost 600 of its 4,200 staff, says Mr Fahy, causing several offices across the country to operate without the necessary staffing.

In April, the Associated Press news agency said it had seen data compiled by NWS employees showing half of its offices had a vacancy rate of 20% - double the rate a decade earlier.

Despite this, climate experts told BBC Verify that the NWS forecasts and flood warnings last week in Texas were as adequate as could be expected.

""The forecasts and warnings all played out in a normal manner. The challenge with this event was that it is very difficult to forecast this type of extreme, localised rainfall,"" says Avantika Gori, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University in Texas.

And Andy Hazelton, a climate scientist who modelled hurricane paths for the NOAA until he was fired during the layoffs in February, says: ""I don't think the staffing issues contributed directly to this event. They got the watches and the warnings out.""

However, some experts have suggested that staffing cuts may have impeded the ability of local NWS offices in Texas to effectively co-ordinate with local emergency services.

""There is a real question as to whether the communication of weather information occurred in a way that was sub-optimal,"" says Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at University of California Los Angeles.

""The impact might have been partially averted if some of the people at the weather service responsible for making those communications were still employed - which they were not in some of these local offices,"" he adds.

The San Angelo and San Antonio offices, which cover the areas affected by the flooding, reportedly had some existing vacancies.

For example, the San Antonio office's website lists several positions as being vacant, including two meteorologists.

The NSW union director told BBC Verify that the San Angelo office was missing a senior hydrologist, a scientist who specialises in flooding events.

The San Antonio office also lacked a ""warning coordinating meteorologist"", who coordinates communications between local forecasting offices and emergency management services in communities, Mr Fahy said.

However, he noted that both offices had temporarily upped their staffing in anticipation of a dangerous weather event, which is typical in these circumstances.

""The NWS weather forecast offices in Austin/San Antonio and San Angelo, Texas had additional forecasters on duty during the catastrophic flooding event,"" NWS spokeswoman Erica Grow Cei said in a statement to BBC Verify. ""All forecasts and warnings were issued in a timely manner,"" she added.

NWS meteorologist Jason Runyen, who covers the San Antonio area, also said in a statement that where the office would typically have two forecasters on duty during clear weather, they had ""up to five on staff"".

When asked on Sunday if government cuts had left key vacancies unfilled at the NWS, President Trump told reporters: ""No, they didn't.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c150/live/33a201a0-5b72-11f0-a40e-a1af2950b220.png,N,,2025-07-07 23:01:49.055887

The legislation extends Trump-era tax cuts that were set to expire this year, and provides tax relief for some workers while increasing the Child Tax Credit and eliminating clean energy tax credits. More notably, the legislation slashes $1.2 trillion in federal spending–mainly targeting Medicaid and food assistance.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates it would cut Medicaid spending by $1 trillion, leaving nearly 12 million more Americans uninsured by 2034. Louisiana, which ranks second in Medicaid enrollment at nearly 32%, could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF.

Republicans celebrate bill’s passage

The bill narrowly passed the House 218–214, with all Louisiana Republicans—Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Rep. Clay Higgins, and Rep. Julia Letlow—backing the legislation. Democrats Troy Carter and Cleo Fields opposed it.

In the Senate, Louisiana Republicans Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy both voted in favor of the bill. Johnson, Scalise, Cassidy, and Kennedy had been instrumental in shaping and advancing the legislation. After President Trump signed the bill into law on Friday, Johnson presented him with the gavel used during the bill’s passage.

In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Johnson called it a “tax cut for everyone” and “jet fuel for small businesses, manufacturers, and farmers” that will “lift the economy.”

He said the bill was the first step in a three-part strategy, with a second reconciliation bill expected by fall and a third by spring before the end of the current Congress.

Scalise also praised Trump and Johnson for uniting Republicans around their agenda.

“And I tell you, a lot of people wrote this bill off for dead. Nobody said it would be easy. But you know what? We didn't come here to do easy things. We came here to do big things. We came here to make history,” Scalise said in a statement.

Cassidy praised the bill for including his Educational Choice for Children Act, which offers tax incentives to encourage donations that help fund K-12 scholarships.

“Our goal is to create an economy that works for working and middle America. We cut taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security, give businesses the stability to create better-paying jobs, secure the border, and support our military. Great start!” he said in another post on X.

In a series of posts on X, Letlow highlighted how the bill will reduce tax burdens for seniors, families, farmers, law enforcement, and workers who rely on tips and overtime pay.

Democrats warn of consequences

Rep. Carter called the bill “catastrophic” and warned it would have “devastating” consequences for Louisianians and people across the country.

“It rips away coverage from 17 million Americans, slashes $1 trillion from health care—with $900 billion from Medicaid alone—and drives up out-of-pocket costs for millions more. It strips support from our hospitals and nursing homes, threatening to close 1 in 4 long-term care facilities, and it puts SNAP at risk for 40 million people—including children, seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities,” Carter said in a statement. “And for what? To hand $1.3 trillion in tax breaks to people making over $500,000—a staggering wealth transfer from working families to billionaires like Elon Musk and Republican megadonors.

Carter announced he and other House lawmakers hold a town hall at 6 p.m. CT on Thursday, July 10 to address concerns after the bill's passage.

Rep. Fields was also blunt in voicing his disdain: “Hospitals will close. People will die. Food will be taken out of hungry children’s mouths.

At a time when business resilience is increasingly defined by energy reliability and sustainability, corporate real estate (CRE) executives are placing a strategic focus on one factor that was once an afterthought in site selection: the power grid.

Energy availability, pricing, and grid readiness are no longer just utility considerations — they are core elements in location decision-making. Whether it’s a data center requiring multi-megawatt capacity, a manufacturing plant seeking clean energy options, or a logistics hub aiming for operational continuity, access to stable, scalable, and affordable power has become a critical success driver.

Today, companies are scrutinizing power infrastructure with the same rigor once reserved for labor markets or incentive packages. For CRE leaders navigating expansion or relocation, understanding the energy landscape has become essential.

From Operating Cost To Strategic Risk Variable

Historically, power costs were treated as a line item in operating budgets. Today, they’re a business continuity risk and a brand consideration rolled into one. Why?

Because the stakes have changed:

Extreme weather and grid failures have revealed vulnerabilities in power infrastructure.

Corporate sustainability mandates now demand renewable energy sourcing and emissions transparency.

Power-intensive sectors like AI, cloud computing, and advanced manufacturing require scalable megawatt capacity — now, not later.

State and local policy variance makes energy costs highly uneven across U.S. regions.

As a result, CRE teams are collaborating with energy consultants and infrastructure engineers earlier in the site selection process to model power availability, resilience, and pricing projections over time.

Power Grid Capacity And Scalability: The Hidden Constraint

One of the most underestimated variables in corporate site selection is grid capacity and readiness for growth. While a site may check all the boxes in terms of location, zoning, and access — it may not have the power infrastructure to support a major corporate facility.

CRE executives should consider:

Current substation capacity and upgrade timelines

Transmission line proximity and congestion points

Interconnection queue wait times, which can exceed 24–36 months in some regions

Load growth forecasts for the utility district

Public-private investment plans to expand capacity

Markets with limited substation access, long utility permitting delays, or strained grids are falling out of favor — regardless of tax advantages or real estate costs.

Energy Pricing: Why Location Can Make Or Break Operating Margins

Power pricing can vary drastically depending on location, rate structures, and regulatory environments. A facility in one state might pay 7 cents per kilowatt-hour, while a similar facility in another state could pay twice that.

CRE leaders must examine:

State and utility-level commercial and industrial rate structures

Time-of-use and peak demand charges

Renewable energy premiums and offsets

Volatility risk from deregulated vs. regulated energy markets

Texas, for instance, offers competitive industrial rates but comes with exposure to power grid volatility. Conversely, states like Washington or Oregon offer lower rates and strong hydroelectric access but may lack site-ready megawatt capacity.

Energy modeling should be integrated into total cost of occupancy (TCO) calculations, especially for facilities where power accounts for 20% or more of operational expenses.

Renewables And ESG: Powering The Corporate Brand

Data center operators, in particular, are actively seeking sites with access to clean energy grids — or where private power purchase agreements (PPAs) are feasible. Similarly, manufacturers with sustainability goals are evaluating regions not only for compliance, but for public alignment with their brand commitments.

Case Example: Northern Nevada’s Energy Edge

Tesla’s Gigafactory outside Reno, Nevada, is often cited as a case study in location strategy based on power alignment. The decision wasn’t just about proximity to California or incentives — it was about tapping into Nevada’s expanding renewable energy infrastructure, open land for solar, and utility cooperation through NV Energy.

The state’s blend of affordable land, flexible regulatory climate, and access to renewable energy has since attracted a cluster of battery and EV suppliers — demonstrating how energy strategy creates economic clustering.

CRE Considerations: Questions To Ask Early In The Process

To ensure that energy factors are fully vetted, CRE executives should integrate the following checkpoints into their location due diligence:

What is the available grid capacity at the site and substation level?

What are the average and peak commercial/industrial rates in the utility zone?

Are renewable energy programs or green tariffs available from local providers?

What is the utility’s track record for reliability and response?

How long is the interconnection queue, and what upgrades are planned?

What state or regional energy policies may affect future pricing or access?

Answering these questions may require engagement with engineering consultants, utility liaisons, and economic development teams — but the return on diligence is a site that can power your business forward.

The Energy-Informed Location Strategy

As CRE professionals navigate location decisions in 2025 and beyond, the imperative is clear: build for power resiliency.

This means shortlisting locations not only for availability today, but for energy scalability tomorrow. It means balancing cost, reliability, ESG alignment, and infrastructure timelines to support rapid deployment and long-term success.

Most importantly, it means recognizing that in the digital and industrial economies alike, power is not a commodity — it’s a competitive advantage.

Final Thought

From AI training centers to EV battery plants, from cloud campuses to chip foundries, the message is consistent: if the grid can’t handle your load, the location won’t work — no matter how favorable the real estate deal.

For CRE leaders making high-stakes decisions, energy is no longer a back-end consideration. It’s a boardroom priority, and one that demands expertise, foresight, and precision planning.

With their One Big Beautiful Bill, national Republicans passed a stunning reversal on the Biden Administration’s effort to marshall the resources of the federal government behind tackling the climate crisis. But even as Arkansas and the United States seem insistent on rolling back the clock on renewable energy development, some progress can’t be rolled back.

Right after I joined the Arkansas Times last July, some exciting news broke. Central Arkansas planning organization Metroplan, in collaboration with the state and many other stakeholders, received a record-breaking $100 million grant aimed at economic development while also reducing Arkansas’ greenhouse gas emissions. And it was exciting to go to their announcement event in sweltering July, and see the plan to make green investments across Arkansas come to fruition.

The climate pollution reduction grant will pay for major infrastructure investments in Central Arkansas, the Fort Smith metro and Northwest Arkansas over the next few years, all under the stewardship of Metroplan.

Despite uncertainty earlier this year around whether Trump would try to illegally freeze the funding appropriated by Congress and distributed by the Environmental Protection Agency, Metroplan has been rolling out the grant awarded to our state. Now their plan for the investments in Central Arkansas, called the Energy and Environment Innovation Plan, has been released to the public. Metroplan is taking public comments until July 29.

Along with explaining which projects will be funded, and laying out goals for greenhouse gas reductions, the plan also includes one of the first public greenhouse gas inventories for Central Arkansas. A greenhouse gas inventory estimates the amount of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, an area produces, and identifies the sources of the greenhouse gas emissions.

While Metroplan leaders weren’t available to speak with me about the plan, I was able to talk with April Ambrose and Stephanie Slagle at the Arkansas Advanced Energy Foundation about their organization’s role in implementing one of the projects receiving Metroplan funding.

Ambrose, who has a long track record of environmental work in Arkansas, is leading a new project called Skillstream to create a talent and career pipeline for people interested in working in renewables and energy efficiency. Skillstream has over $2 million in funding from the climate pollution reduction grant to fund workforce programming and training over the next five years.

Her project, one of many funded by Metroplan’s grant, aims to connect young people and underserved people with employers, training, resources and support to help them become the workforce of the green energy transition. Part of the opportunity, said Ambrose, is that advanced energy jobs are growing at double the national average, with almost half not requiring college degrees.

“For a lot of these industries, like commercial energy auditors or solar installers, there aren’t existing training pathways where somebody is exposed to the career, knows how to go about getting that job, and knows about the career progression,” Ambrose said. “It’s very sporadic and employers feel like they have to train internally or home-grow their candidates. … So they need a program to help facilitate creating pathways for candidates, and to develop training programs in the state.”

Skillsteam will host two employer forums in July, one at Shorter College in North Little Rock on July 16, and the second one at The Blue Lion in Fort Smith on July 22. But the program is also making many other efforts to connect energy employers with potential employees, including through building a job board of energy jobs.

Ambrose said that even while Washington, D.C., turns against opportunities for low-income and disadvantaged communities, she remains passionate about getting involved. Whatever happens in D.C., Ambrose is sure the renewable sector will continue to grow, and she wants Arkansans to have opportunities to work in these fields and benefit from the growth.

“For whatever reason, climate change is politicized, and it makes it increasingly difficult for some of these pathways to be created,” Ambrose said. “But if we want these industries to grow, we have to address the workforce issues.”

The Plan

Metroplan estimates suggest their plan for their $49 million share of the grant could reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Central Arkansas by 63% over the next 25 years. Their greenhouse gas inventory revealed that Central Arkansas emits 9.1 million metric tons of greenhouse gases a year, with transportation and commercial buildings driving the emissions. Another 3 million emissions are offset or sequestered by forests and other land use every year.

The Central Arkansas plan identifies five ways to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, while also driving economic development:

Building out “Green Corridors,” which are sprawling trails with plenty of greenery that act as alternative roads for pedestrians and cyclists.

Investing in local energy, by providing energy efficiency funding for buildings and installing solar panels and battery storage for renewable energy.

Investing in increased recycling to prevent landfill expansion

Using funds to encourage infill development of vacant and underused urban land to incentivize more walkability.

Building out electric vehicle charging stations that are publicly accessible.

Much of the infrastructure improvements Metroplan seeks to bankroll aim to make less carbon- intensive forms of transportation more accessible.

The Arkansas Advanced Energy Foundation will also be helping Metroplan implement energy efficiency upgrades through their “C-PACE” program to finance low- interest loans for energy efficiency upgrades to buildings in Central Arkansas.

Without Metroplan’s investments over the coming decade, their forecast suggested greenhouse gas emissions would drop by 22% by 2050. But with the investments, Metroplan predicts they can more than double emissions reductions in Central Arkansas.

Metroplan hopes to fund over 222 miles of regional trails, connecting all of Central Arkansas with pedestrian-friendly transportation infrastructure. Greenways provide residents an option for active, emissions-free travel and can sequester carbon from the atmosphere with green scenery like trees. But most of the greenhouse gas savings in the plan are expected to come from renewable energy and energy efficiency investments, which could cut 36 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions through 2050.

Other goals in the plan include building 975 megawatts of solar energy, developing 16,000 acres of vacant urban property and building 11,000 publicly accessible electric vehicle charging stations by 2050.

Metroplan is hosting two virtual townhalls to hear community members’ thoughts on the plan on July 10 and July 17. You can sign up at this link.

Brazil will launch its own initiatives to promote climate finance in Cop 30.","Developed countries must fully engage in climate finance to support developing countries trying to meet Paris agreement goals, top Brazilian officials said at the Brics summit held in Rio de Janeiro on 6-7 July.

""One decade after the Paris agreement, [the world] lacks resources for a fair and planned transition,"" Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said. ""Developing countries will be the most affected by losses and damages, while they are also the ones that have fewer ways to fund mitigation and adaptation,"" Lula da Silva said during his keynote address Monday.

The Brics summit discussed climate finance in anticipation of the UN Cop 30 climate summit, which will be also be held Brazil, in November. The group issued a declaration that reinforced its commitment to uphold multilateralism as a solution for climate actions, while it also emphasized developed countries' responsibility towards developing countries to financially enable just transition pathways and sustainable development aligned with the Paris agreement.

The Cop 29 summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024 managed to reach an agreement to allocate $300bn/yr in resources for climate action. But delegates to the upcoming UN Cop 30 summit are targeting at least $1.3bn/yr in public and private funds to tackle climate change, focusing especially on countries that are already dealing with extreme weather conditions and lack financial resources to mitigate it.

The Brics also announced a memorandum of understanding on the Brics Carbon Markets Partnership focused on capacity building and multinational cooperation to support climate strategies such as mitigation efforts and emergency resource mobilization. The declaration opposes unilateral protectionist measures, arguing that they ""deliberately disrupt the global supply and production chains and distort competition.""

Climate justice, the fight against desertification, strengthened climate diplomacy and subsidies to environmental services were the main topics of discussion during the Brics summit, Brazil's environment minister Marina Silva said. Brazil will launch its own initiatives to promote climate finance in Cop 30. One program already launched is the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) fund that aims to raise $125bn to preserve 1bn hectares of global tropical forests across 80 developing countries.

Brics' development bank NDB will target 40pc of its investments to promote sustainable development, such as energy transition. The bank has approved $40bn in investments for clean energy, environment protection and water supply, it said last week. Brazil accounts for $6.4bn of total investments, gathering resources to 29 projects under climate actions, according to the institution.

Brazil currently holds the presidency of the Brics, which also includes Russia, China, India and South Africa. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran are also members. Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Thailand, Cuba, Uganda, Malaysia, Nigeria, Vietnam and Uzbekistan act as partner nations.

Heated speech

During his keynote address, Lula criticized the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as an institution that promotes unilateralism and stressed his support for reforming institutions of the UN to promote multilateralism and political equity for developing countries.

He also mentioned that 65 of the biggest banks in the world committed to a $869bn investment to the fossil fuels sector last year.

The measure boosts defense and border wall funding and makes Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent, offsetting some of those costs with deep cuts to Medicaid, food assistance programs, student loans and clean energy programs.

Some of the law’s key pieces will take effect later this year, while others will not be implemented until well after midterm elections.

Here are when the biggest parts of the new law will take effect:

Medicaid reforms

Among the bill’s most contentious parts are its reforms to Medicaid, the joint federal and state program that provides health insurance coverage to low-income Americans.

A number of Republicans were worried about the cuts to Medicaid, with some saying the party risked political backlash by adopting the cuts since many GOP voters could be affected by them.

The question may be how many of those voters feel the effects before November 2026.

Roughly 16 million people could lose their health insurance coverage by 2034 due to cuts to Medicaid and changes to the Affordable Care Act marketplace, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Americans could also lose their coverage due to new work requirements for the program. Under the law, adults between the ages of 19 and 64 will need to work at least 80 hours a month to qualify for Medicaid coverage unless they qualify for certain exemptions.

Some adults will be exempt from the new work requirements if they have dependent children or have certain medical conditions.

Medicaid’s funding changes under the law are not scheduled to take effect until 2028, well past the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Some work requirements could come earlier, however. They are to begin no later than Dec. 31, 2026.

Changes to food assistance

The law will change the country’s largest food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps. Like Medicaid, SNAP will also undergo funding and work requirement changes.

In the past, the federal government has funded the program while states have taken on the cost of managing it. Under the bill’s conditions, states will be required to partially fund SNAP if they have a payment error rate of 6 percent or higher beginning in 2028 — two years after the midterms.

However, the law also allows states with payment error rates of 13.34 or higher to delay paying for the program for two additional years.

Previously, most adults had to work until age 54 to qualify for SNAP unless they were a parent with dependents. Now, the working age to stay in the program has been raised to 64, and only parents with children younger than 14 are exempt from the requirement, according to the law.

The law does not specifically state when the updated work requirements will begin to take effect, but a spokesperson for the Senate Republicans said there is no “delayed implementation in the law.” A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture has yet to respond to questions from The Hill about the new enforcement requirement.

New tax cuts

The law paves the way for numerous tax changes, with the most significant being to the cuts Trump enacted during his first term in 2017. Those expiring tax cuts are permanent, effective immediately.

Under the law, Americans living in high-tax states such as New York and California will receive larger income tax deductions for state and local taxes, otherwise known as SALT, beginning this year and lasting until 2028.

Republicans will be selling these tax cuts aggressively, since people who qualify for the cuts will feel them well ahead of the midterm elections.

Some tax provisions will impact working-class voters.

Starting this year, tip amounts of less than $25,000 will be tax-deductible through 2028. There is a cap for the deduction of a $150,000 income or $300,000 for people filing jointly, according to the law.

The law also changes when overtime pay will be tax-deductible. Starting this year, up to $12,500 of extra overtime pay is tax-deductible until 2028. Again, there is an income limit of $150,000 a year for a single person or $300,000 for those filing jointly.

Changes to the child tax credit will also take effect this year. Now, the child tax credit is $2,200 for every qualifying child. The amount will also be adjusted for inflation starting next year.

Changes to the senior deduction also take effect this year. Beginning this year until 2028, Americans older than 65 can deduct an additional $6,000 on their tax returns.

Rollbacks to green energy

The law eliminates numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy and energy efficiency programs. Under the law, $7,500 tax credits for electric vehicles will be eliminated starting Sept. 30 of this year — well ahead of the midterms.

It also eliminates a $3,200 tax credit for Americans making energy-improvement changes to their homes beginning in 2026 and ends tax credits for Americans who make investments in clean energy sources for their homes, including solar panels, fuel cells or battery storage technology starting next year.

The law also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which helps finance local emissions-reduction projects, beginning this year. Although it appears that current contracts under the program will remain in place.

Changes to higher education

The bill will make some changes to how Americans finance higher education.

Grad PLUS loans as well as repayment options like the SAVE Plan and Income-Contingent Repayment and Pay as You Earn plans will be scrapped and replaced with a Repayment Assistance Plan or a standard repayment plan.

Grad PLUS loans will be replaced with new borrowing caps of $100,000 for many grad students and $200,000 for professional students, such as those enrolled in medical schools or law schools.

For undergraduate students, Stafford loans will remain capped, and Parent PLUS loans now have a reduced lifetime cap of $65,000. All of the loan changes are set to take effect in July of 2026.

The law also changes tax rates for colleges based on the size of their endowments. In 2026, schools with higher endowments per student will receive higher tax rates on their endowment. Schools with endowments between $500,000 and $750,000 will have a tax rate of 1.4 percent.

Those with endowments of $750,000 to $2 million now have a tax rate of 4 percent, and those with more than $2 million will be taxed at 8 percent.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/When_OConnellDomenech_AP_EvanVucci.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-07 18:16:19.678591

The biggest EV tax credits in U.S. history are coming to an end.

Thanks to President Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” passed on July 4—a federal budget deal that quietly phases out clean energy incentives—all three major EV tax credits will expire on September 30, 2025. That includes:

❌ Up to $7,500 for new EVs

❌ Up to $4,000 for used EVs

❌ Up to $7,500 for leases (via the commercial EV credit)

These credits have helped millions of Americans save money on EVs. But come October 1, they’ll be gone.

If you want to lock in up to $7,500 in savings on a Tesla, Hyundai, Ford, or Rivian—this is your window.

What EV Tax Credits Are Ending on September 30?

New EV Tax Credit

$7,500

EVs under $55k–$80k

Used EV Tax Credit

$4,000

Used EVs under $25k

Commercial/Leasing EV Credit

Leased EVs and fleet use

These incentives were expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Now, they’re being rolled back as part of the 2025 budget deal.

“This is going to be the summer of the EV,” says Ingrid Malmgren, Senior Policy Director at Plug In America. “Come the end of September, those credits will be gone.”

Why This EV Tax Credit Deadline Actually Matters

Let’s look at what these credits mean in real dollars:

$44,990

Used Tesla Model 3

$19,000

$23,000

Chevy Equinox EV

$22,500

$30,000

Depending on the vehicle, the federal EV tax credit covers 15–25% of the total cost. Waiting could cost you thousands.

Step 1: Check If You Qualify for the EV Tax Credit

Small modular reactors probably make the most sense at remote rural sites that are heavy energy users, the premier added.
Small modular reactors, or SMRs, generate about one-third of the power of traditional nuclear plants and can be prefabricated elsewhere before being shipped to site.
An initial project description was filed in April for the Peace River Nuclear Power Project, kicking off the federal review process.","Alberta plans to hold public consultations this fall on adding nuclear power to the province's energy mix, Premier Danielle Smith said Monday.

There have long been discussions about building reactors in Alberta — including ones that could power oilsands operations — but the province is currently reliant on greenhouse-gas emitting natural gas for electricity.

Those conversations are to begin anew around September or October, when Chantelle de Jonge, parliamentary secretary for affordability and utilities, plans to hold nuclear consultation sessions.

""We want to talk to Albertans, because it's new for us,"" Smith told reporters alongside Ontario Premier Doug Ford after the two flipped pancakes at the Alberta premier's annual Stampede breakfast.

""It's not new for Ontario. Ontario gets 60 per cent of their power, I understand, on their grid from nuclear energy.""

Small modular reactors probably make the most sense at remote rural sites that are heavy energy users, the premier added.

""Our oilsands projects are perfect for it, if you can get both the power and steam, power and heat.""

Small modular reactors, or SMRs, generate about one-third of the power of traditional nuclear plants and can be prefabricated elsewhere before being shipped to site.

Ontario Power Generation is building an SMR at its Darlington site east of Toronto, which would make it the first power company in North America to connect such a plant to the grid. There are plans to build three more SMR units there.

Ford said SMRs don't themselves employ a lot of people when they're up and running, but they could enable tech giants like Amazon or Google to set up shop with electricity-hungry artificial intelligence data centres.

""And that's where the jobs are created because they just suck an endless amount of energy, these data centres,"" Ford told reporters.

""So that's the way of the future. We're leading the world and we're gonna make sure we share that technology right across the country.""

At least one U.S. developer of small modular rectors has a keen eye on Alberta as a growth market.

""We have designed a small modular reactor that is perfectly suited for Alberta,"" Clay Sell, CEO of X-Energy Reactor Co., said in an interview last month.

The problem with conventional reactors has been their complexity, he said on the sidelines of the Global Energy Show in Calgary.

""If you ever get one built, you'll run it for the next 80 years, but they're hard to build and they're capital intensive to build,"" Sell said.

""So our whole approach has been from the beginning: 'How do we make it simpler? How do we make it smaller? How do we have fewer components?""'

X-Energy is pursuing opportunities to add power to Alberta's grid in general, as well as to link to steam-assisted gravity drainage oilsands projects that pull bitumen from deep underground through wells rather than mine it.

""Our plant is perfectly suited to perform that same mission on a small footprint,"" Sell said.

OPG is looking at using X-Energy plants at industrial sites in Ontario.

There is a larger-scale plant planned for northwestern Alberta that would have two twin Candu Monark nuclear reactors licensed for a maximum output of 4,800 megawatts.

That would represent up to a quarter of the province's existing electricity generation.

""We initially thought, 'wow, that would swamp our power grid,""' Smith said.

""And now with all the demands for AI data centres, we're thinking, 'hmm, that's maybe exactly what we need.""'

An initial project description was filed in April for the Peace River Nuclear Power Project, kicking off the federal review process.

In a speech to the Global Energy Show in June, Candu Energy senior vice-president Carl Marcotte said Alberta would benefit from adding nuclear to the mix.

""Whatever Albertans decide to build, you will. But you need a lot more power to do it — reliable power that runs 24/7, power that works in great weather and when it's -45 C... and it must be affordable — it really must,"" he said.

""So yes, of course Alberta's abundant natural gas resources can and should do all that...But wouldn't it benefit from having a powerful, cleaner, reliable ally in that growth, providing important baseload electricity with low emissions?""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7347687.1731180536!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/darlington-nuclear-generating-station-and-smr-construction-aeria.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-07-07 20:10:27.740158

""Five minutes of that siren going off could have saved every single one of those children,"" she told AFP.","The Texas flash floods this weekend that left scores dead, including many children, offer a stark illustration.

Here is a look at the intertwined forces that amplified this storm's impact.

'Flash Flood Alley'

Texas's Hill Country sits in an area known as ""Flash Flood Alley,"" explains Hatim Sharif, a hydrologist at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

Warm Gulf air rushes up the Balcones Escarpment -- a line of steep hills and cliffs that arcs southwest down from near Dallas -- cools, and dumps torrents onto thin soils that quickly give way to bedrock.

Runoff then funnels through a dense web of creeks.

""Water will rise very, very quickly, within minutes or a few hours,"" Sharif told AFP.

The early hours of July 4 proved that.

Around 3:00 am, a gauge near Camp Mystic in Hunt showed the Guadalupe River rising nearly a foot (30 centimeters) every five minutes; by 4:30 am the river had surged more than 20 feet, National Weather Service data show.

That's enough water to sweep away people, vehicles and buildings.

An urgent NWS warning went out shortly after 1:00 am, but most campers were asleep; phones are banned, coverage is patchy, and darkness makes escape routes hard to judge.

Sharif urges the use of hydrologic forecasts that convert rainfall into likely river levels.

""Rainfall needs to be translated into runoff,"" he said. ""If you have 10 inches, what will happen?""

Summer camps have long been drawn to the region for its natural beauty. But with increasing risks, Sharif warns that treating these sites as safe or permanent is unwise.

'We need to adapt'

A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, loading the dice for heavier downpours.

A new analysis by ClimaMeter finds that the meteorological conditions preceding the floods, which delivered more than twice the monthly average rainfall in a single day, could not be explained by natural variability alone.

""Climate change is already affecting us, so we need to adapt,"" said Mireia Ginesta, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford who co-authored the research, which is funded by the European Union and the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).

""We also need to cut our emissions, and make sure that proper funding is provided to the forecast services and research in general on climate change.""

The call comes as the National Weather Service, like other agencies, has experienced deep staffing cuts under President Donald Trump's administration.

Experts stress, however, that NWS forecasters performed admirably under the circumstances.

The real failure, wrote climate scientist Daniel Swain on Bluesky, ""was not a bad weather prediction, it was one of 'last mile' forecast/warning dissemination.""

No warning system

For years, commissioners in Kerr County, where the camps lie, considered flood sirens and digital alerts to replace the informal practice of summer camp staff getting on the radio and warning fellow camps.

Minutes from a 2016 meeting show officials labeling even a feasibility study ""a little extravagant,"" suggesting sirens would mainly help tourists, and vouching for the word-of-mouth system.

The debate rolled on. In 2021, commissioners again balked, this time wary of federal funds tied to the Biden administration that they opposed politically.

After the disaster, San Antonio mother Nicole Wilson -- who almost sent her daughters to Camp Mystic -- launched a petition on Change.org urging Governor Greg Abbott to approve a modern warning network.

""Five minutes of that siren going off could have saved every single one of those children,"" she told AFP.

The company went on to say the “price is subject to change” and “does not include taxes, fees, and accessories.” While the latter is to be expected, Slate’s revised statement suggests we can expect a price hike of around $5,000. That makes the truck far less appealing as the bigger and better equipped Ford Maverick begins at $28,145.

Slate hasn’t publicly addressed the change, but it appears to be tied to President Trump’s signing of The One Big Beautiful Bill into law. The sprawling piece of legislation includes everything from a tax deduction on auto loan interest to funding for a “Golden Dome” missile defense system.

It also cut funding for solar and wind facilities as well as the clean vehicle credit. The latter will be phased out on September 30, 2025 instead of December 31, 2032. This applies to both new and used vehicles.

While the changes are brief – just one line for the previously-owned clean vehicle credit – they’ll have a huge impact on electric vehicles as consumers will no longer get a discount of up to $7,500. This means prices will likely rise, while demand could fall.

This story is published through our partnership with NOTUS.

The Trump administration is looking to make sweeping cuts at the nation’s weather agencies, including the closure of all federally funded meteorology labs.

The cuts also come as deadly flooding hit Texas on July 4, and as flash floods caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal surprised parts of central North Carolina on Sunday—underscoring just how crucial it is to have adequate warning systems in place to anticipate natural disasters.

The targeted labs include:

Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, Florida

Air Resources Laboratory locations in College Park, Maryland; Idaho Falls, Idaho; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee

Chemical Sciences Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado

the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey

Global Monitoring Laboratory locations in Colorado, Alaska, Hawaii, American Samoa, and the South Pole

Global Systems Laboratory Boulder, Colorado

National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma

Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, Washington

Physical Sciences Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado

The National Severe Storms Laboratory at the University of Oklahoma in Norman is responsible for radar breakthroughs in forecasting that the nation relies on for storm warnings and emergency preparedness. The Trump administration’s proposed cuts there prompted a rare rebuke from a prominent Republican member of Congress.

“I want to make sure that whoever’s proposing this actually goes down there and looks at it and meets them,” said Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, chair of the Appropriations Committee. “I’ve allowed things in my district to be closed before, but this is a national asset, and I want to be very careful about what we do with it.”

These facilities also support local economies. According to the University of Oklahoma, the federal lab in Norman helps sustain more than 900 jobs in the region.

But it’s one of more than 10 weather and oceanographic laboratories listed for termination in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s request for funding next year, part of much larger cuts requested by the Trump administration. If approved by Congress, NOAA would receive just $4.5 billion in funding next year, meaning it would have $2 billion less and 12,000 fewer personnel to support studying and forecasting weather events.

An Office of Management and Budget spokesperson told NOTUS in a statement that the budget request provides “ample” funding for NOAA, and that it “refocuses the agency on its core mission and streamlines operations.” The spokesperson also pointed to some research divisions getting consolidated into National Weather Service offices.

“NOAA will continue critical work and research that supports navigation, weather forecasting, commercial fisheries, etc., while terminating funds spent on left-wing Green New Scam activities masquerading as science,” the spokesperson said.

But Cole isn’t the only Oklahoman pushing back on the NSSL’s potential closure.

A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said in a statement that the NSSL’s closure would be a “setback” to storm warning innovation and emergency preparedness, and that getting rid of it “threatens the future of storm warning innovation that keeps communities safe year after year.”

Norman’s Chamber of Commerce President Scott Martin, a former state House Republican, also said its loss would be “devastating” for the community and its local economy.

And that Oklahoma lab is just one of the over two dozen research labs and institutes the Trump administration wants to stop supporting.

“There are just so many key pieces of the forecast puzzle that came out of these places, and out of these people who are going to be let go, so that’s really disturbing that we’re willing to give all that up,” said James Franklin, who served as the National Hurricane Center chief until 2017.

Franklin added the loss of federal support would not only cripple meteorological science if the federal government moves forward with these cuts, but set it back decades.

“It’s hard to imagine what the next 25 years would look like if they all went away,” he said.

If the proposal is approved, the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, NOAA’s research arm, would be dismantled. That would mean four research labs in Boulder, Colorado, would close, along with the Air Resources Laboratory, headquartered in Maryland, which studies pollution and helps officials make decisions about whether to issue stay-at-home orders when air quality decreases.

The Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, Florida, is also a possible cut. Experts there interpret essential real-time data collected from NOAA’s aerial hurricane-monitoring operations that significantly improve hurricane modeling. And, like the NSSL, the AOML partners with local and state researchers.

Rick Spinrad, the former head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under Joe Biden, said the loss of the AOML would “put a lot of people in harm’s way” because teams there help monitor hurricane tracks and intensity.

But NOAA’s proposal drew another concern from Spinrad. Industries and state emergency preparedness officials alike rely on NWS forecasts to make decisions, he argued, so less accurate models would cause unnecessary economic losses—likely much more than any of these proposed cuts would save.

“The weather service is about a billion dollars a year endeavor, and every year, we’re seeing hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of damage from natural disasters,” Spinrad told NOTUS. “There have been many economic studies, and every one of them shows a dramatic return on investment.”

These research labs run programs that have been bolstered by years of bipartisan support from Congress. The last weather bill, which passed with simple voice votes in both chambers, provided funds for NOAA to “prioritize weather research to improve weather data, modeling, computing, forecasts, and warnings for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy.” Trump signed it into law in April 2017.

Still, it’s up to Congress to build the actual budget based on NOAA’s request. Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska, who proposed legislation last month to allow NWS to fix its understaffing issues, said he wasn’t too worried about Congress approving the proposal as-is. He said in a statement to NOTUS that these proposals from the administration are just suggestions.

“I have faith the House Appropriations Committee will prioritize public safety as they craft budget bills for the upcoming year,” Flood said.

Below are some of the Bill’s key changes to the IRA’s energy tax credits.
Other types of projects, such as geothermal, fuel cell, combined-heat-and-power systems, biogas systems, waste energy recovery, thermal energy, and battery storage, may still claim the § 45Y Production Tax Credits and § 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credits.
The energy credit will be denied where the “threshold percentage” for material assistance is exceeded.
The following chart summarizes other key energy credits the Bill impacts:","On July 3, 2025, Congress approved a version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (the Bill), which significantly impacts the energy tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). President Trump held a signing ceremony in the Oval Office on July 4, 2025, during which he signed the Bill into law.

Below are some of the Bill’s key changes to the IRA’s energy tax credits.

Accelerated Termination and Phase-Out Schedules

Most significantly, the Bill contains an early termination of the solar and wind tax credits (Internal Revenue Code (IRC) §§ 45Y and 48E). Specifically, the Bill eliminates a taxpayer’s ability to claim the 45Y Production Tax Credits and 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credits for a solar and wind project (i) where beginning of construction (BOC) occurs on or after July 4, 2026 (the one-year anniversary of the Bill’s enactment), and (ii) the project is placed in service after December 31, 2027.

Thus, a solar or wind project placed in service before December 31, 2027, is still eligible for the credits. Additionally, a solar or wind project where BOC occurs before July 4, 2026, is eligible for the credits even if it is placed in service after December 31, 2027. We expect that the standard “continuity” requirements would apply, which would allow for 2028, 2029, and 2030 placed in service dates.

Other types of projects, such as geothermal, fuel cell, combined-heat-and-power systems, biogas systems, waste energy recovery, thermal energy, and battery storage, may still claim the § 45Y Production Tax Credits and § 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credits.; The credits, however, will phase out after December 31, 2032, as follows:

100% credit available if BOC occurs on or before December 31, 2033

75% credit available if BOC occurs on or before December 31, 2034

50% credit available if BOC occurs on or before December 31, 2035

0% credit available if BOC occurs on or after January 1, 2036

With respect to the § 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Credit, a project must begin construction on or before December 31, 2027, to remain eligible.

The Bill also extended and modified the § 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, inserting provisions that: (i) require the feedstock for qualifying Sustainable Aviation Fuel be produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada; (ii) exclude from the definition of Transportation Fuel any fuel that is produced from a fuel for which a 45Z credit is allowable, thus precluding double counting, and (iii) preclude the use of a negative emission rate for a transportation fuel. The Bill also extends the recovery period for the § 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit for an additional two years through December 31, 2029.

The following tax credits for clean vehicles and energy efficient buildings terminate on the below dates:

IRC § 25C – Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit December 31, 2025

IRC § 25D – Residential Clean Energy Credit December 31, 2025

IRC § 25E – Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credits September 30, 2025

IRC § 30C – Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Credit June 30, 2026

IRC § 30D – Clean Vehicle Credit September 30, 2025

IRC § 45L – New Energy Efficient Home Credit June 30, 2026

IRC § 45W – Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit September 30, 2025

Transferability Impacts

The Bill generally left alone the current energy credit transferability provisions in IRC § 6418. However, the Bill did impose new limitations on transferring credits to “specified foreign entities” (SFEs) and “foreign influenced entities” (FIEs), and in some cases, both SFEs and FIEs as “prohibited foreign entities” (PFEs).

SFEs are generally: (i) foreign entities of concern listed in 15 U.S.C. 4651; (ii) Chinese military company entities; or (iii) entities with ties to North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran.

FIEs are generally: (i) entities where an SFE can appoint an executive-level officer or board director; (ii) entities where an SFE controls at least 25% of such entity; (iii) SFEs in the aggregate own at least 40% of such entity; (iv) an SFE holds at least 15% of the debt of such entity; or (v) an entity over which an SFE has “effective control” (defined as authority over key aspects of the energy project’s components, energy generation, or energy storage as well as an SFE that receives payments from such an entity via licensing arrangements)

PFEs are generally both SFEs and FIEs determined as of the last day of the taxable year.

With respect to PFEs, the Bill denies energy credits under IRC §§ 45X, 45Y, and 48E where the eligible taxpayer receives “material assistance from prohibited foreign entities.” The Bill determines “material assistance” by looking at the taxpayer’s total direct costs for all manufactured products and components that are mined, produced, manufactured, or otherwise attributable to a PFE.

The energy credit will be denied where the “threshold percentage” for material assistance is exceeded. For projects that begin construction in: (i) 2026 – 40%; (ii) 2027 – 45%; (iii) 2028 – 50%; (iv) 2029 – 55%; and (v) 2030 and onward – 60%.

Other Impacts

Domestic Content Percentages for § 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credits: The Bill revises the domestic content applicable percentages for qualified facilities and energy storage technology seeking to claim 48E Clean Electricity Investment credits as follows:

40% if BOC occurs on or before June 16, 2025

45% if BOC occurs after June 16, 2025, and before December 31, 2025

50% if BOC occurs on or before December 31, 2026

55% if BOC occurs on or after January 1, 2027

Tax Depreciation: Although IRC §§ 45Y and 48E property would still be listed as five-year modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) (i.e., accelerated depreciation), the Bill specifically removes solar and wind energy property from the five-year MACRS designation where BOC occurs on or after January 1, 2025. Despite this, the Bill retains 100% bonus depreciation under IRC § 168(k), which may still be available for such projects.

Foxconn (famous for building Apple iPhones) reportedly wanted to help Nissan with production and software development, with a bend toward all-electric vehicles.
Located in the Kanagawa prefecture city of Yokosuka, Nissan’s Japanese facility is quite large and presently employs over 4,000 people.
While the company already helps build EVs for Yulon Motori, it is actively developing models of its own.
The company has said it would like to build EVs of its own at the Ohio plant in the coming years.","Nissan is reportedly back in discussions with Foxconn regarding EV assembly. Previous negotiations pertained to the Taiwanese company buying a major stake in the Japanese automaker after the prospect of a Honda-Nissan merger was abandoned. Foxconn (famous for building Apple iPhones) reportedly wanted to help Nissan with production and software development, with a bend toward all-electric vehicles. Now, Foxconn is allegedly interested in utilizing Nissan-owned facilities to build its own vehicles.

It’s not a secret that Nissan is looking to downsize at the moment. The company wants to streamline operations and reduce costs as it seeks a new partner. According to Japan’s Nikkei, this has opened up the door for negotiations that could lead to Foxconn utilizing Nissan’s Oppama plant as a venue to manufacture its own EVs.

Located in the Kanagawa prefecture city of Yokosuka, Nissan’s Japanese facility is quite large and presently employs over 4,000 people. In addition to assembly, it likewise serves as a development facility and comes with a test track to assist with R&D. This could make it an ideal venue to serve as an all-encompassing facility for Foxconn — which has expressed a desire to build EVs of its own for several years now.

The Oppama facility is also underutilized at present. Peak production is said to be capped at 240,000 vehicles annually and Nissan is estimated to only be using about half that at present. Due to the fact that many Japanese brands are considering shifting even more production to Western markets in a bid to avoid U.S. tariffs, the site is not assumed to see increased demand and presently focuses on smaller vehicles serving the Japanese market.

That could make it an ideal location for Foxconn to try its hand at large-scale vehicle manufacturing. While the company already helps build EVs for Yulon Motori, it is actively developing models of its own. It has likewise agreed to help Mitsubishi (which is already allied with Nissan) develop all-electric vehicles. Oppama could become the birthplace of some of those models while helping Nissan’s bottom line.

However, negotiations are reportedly in the early stages and we’ve seen things fall apart for Foxconn before. In the United States, Foxconn was supposed to manufacture EVs for Lordstown Motors in Ohio. That deal fell through following numerous scandals and Lordstown went bankrupt in 2023 after selling the former GM facility to Foxconn. The site was then supposed to become a venue for building Fisker EVs. But that company likewise went under the following year.

While we cannot fault Foxconn for those startups going bankrupt, it does underscore how unpredictable these industrial agreements sometimes pan out. The company has said it would like to build EVs of its own at the Ohio plant in the coming years. But this likely wouldn’t be able to serve the Asian market, necessitating additional production at a location like Nissan’s Oppama facility.",https://cdn-fastly.thetruthaboutcars.com/media/2025/07/07/14381/social-45129385.jpg?size=1200x628,N,,2025-07-07 18:16:02.346574

Today, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued a methodology to analyze reserve power margins across the country that systematically undercounts the contributions of clean energy to meet the nation’s energy needs and protect system reliability. DOE plans to use this methodology to deem certain generators, likely coal and natural gas, as critical to system reliability, consistent with its recent actions.

Over the last few months, DOE has already started issuing orders under the Federal Power Act section 202(c) that would extend the lives of polluting power plants past their planned expiration dates. The orders falsely invoke emergency powers to upend the usual legal and regulatory decision-making process, requiring consumers to pay to operate plants that are not needed to meet reliability needs and that harm air quality and public health. DOE is now likely to renew these 202(c) orders and issue additional orders using the new methodology in order to continue preventing retirement of expensive, polluting power plants.

Coal, gas and oil fired power plants spew millions of pounds of health-harming and climate-warming pollution into the air each year, and cost consumers millions of dollars more than cleaner energy sources. Extending the lives of aging fossil fueled power plants usurps the judgment of state regulators, the utility, state Attorneys General, and numerous other parties who negotiate and approve the settlements to retire these plants.

Additionally, accreditation methods approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) are typically developed by grid operators over months and even years of significant stakeholder input because these methods must take into account the different resource mixes, market constructs, and other conditions in a given region. DOE’s rushed one-size-fits-all approach – developed behind closed doors with no public input – is flawed and it could cost ratepayers an average of $2 billion or more every year without providing corresponding reliability benefits.

Recently, public interest groups challenged DOE’s illegal order to extend the J.H. Campbell power plant and Eddystone oil and gas power plant past their planned expiration dates.

Statement of Christine Powell, Deputy Managing Attorney for Earthjustice’s Clean Energy program: “Determining the reserve margin and critical resources are complex decisions with severe health and economic consequences that Congress rightly entrusted FERC to oversee using a robust public adjudication process. Today’s methodology attempts to usurp that process, and would impose billions of dollars and harmful pollutants on consumers without any corresponding benefits for anyone except for the coal industry.”

Statement of Greg Wannier, Senior Attorney for the Sierra Club: “The methodology released today is another attempt to push the false narrative that our country is facing a so-called ‘energy emergency’, so that the DOE can continue bailing out the dying coal industry. The report does not provide any basis for the DOE to to bypass FERC and the regulatory process or forcibly keep coal plants online past their planned retirements —any effort by DOE to do so would be an extraordinary and unlawful overreach of its regulatory authority and would be costly, dangerous, and harmful especially to the communities near these power plants. We will continue to hold the DOE accountable for any decisions it makes that have severe, direct consequences on everyday Americans.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gettyimages-1240947794_crop_2k.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 18:15:13.635360

The Department of Energy released budget details last week that reveal the shifting of fiscal year 2025 funds away from wind and solar energy and into water and geothermal. Congress enacted $318 million for solar initiatives for FY24, but DOE plans to spend $42 million on them in FY25, representing an 87% cut. Wind energy initiatives similarly will see a 78% cut. Meanwhile, the department more than quadrupled funding for geothermal energy from FY24 levels, and water power will see a 50% increase.

Congress passed legislation earlier this year that maintained most science agencies’ topline budgets at or near the levels from FY24 but did not specify funding at the program level. Democrats overseeing DOE appropriations argued that the legislation carried forward FY24 appropriations for solar and wind energy and that DOE’s spending plan for FY25 is “in defiance” of the spending law.

The department also shifted money between programs within the Office of Science, including a 30% increase to isotope R&D and production and a 22% cut to the workforce development program from FY24 levels. Other areas will see smaller changes, including increases for nuclear physics, advanced scientific computing research, and high energy physics, and cuts to biological and environmental research and basic energy sciences.

Senate appropriators turn to science agencies this week

The Senate Appropriations Committee will meet Thursday to advance its fiscal year 2026 budget proposals for multiple science agencies, including the National Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and NASA. The results of the meeting will preview the extent to which the Senate intends to challenge President Donald Trump’s proposed funding cuts to science in his 2026 budget request. Trump is seeking large cuts to all of these agencies, including a 56% cut to NSF and a 47% cut to NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.

The House Appropriations Committee was set to hold similar mark-ups this week for its corresponding subcommittees, but those have been removed from the House calendar as of Monday morning.

NOAA nominees to testify

The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee will hold a hearing Wednesday on the nominations of Neil Jacobs to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Taylor Jordan to be NOAA’s top official for environmental observation and prediction. Jacobs served as acting NOAA administrator in the first Trump administration during the scientific integrity controversy that erupted concerning the forecast of Hurricane Dorian. A later investigation concluded that Jacobs’ violated the agency’s scientific integrity policies by caving to political pressure from the White House to undermine a weather report that contradicted President Trump’s prediction that Hurricane Dorian would strike Alabama, though Jacobs disputed the investigation’s conclusion.

In the fiscal year 2026 budget request, the Trump administration is proposing to eliminate NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. Some of OAR’s programs would be transferred to the National Weather Service, including the Earth Prediction Innovation Center (EPIC). During his past stint at NOAA, Jacobs said a top priority was improving weather forecasting collaboration through EPIC. One potential topic of discussion during the hearing is the NWS role in issuing warnings about the flash floods that swept through Texas last week.

The EPA’s latest actions on steel industry emissions have the effect of granting that request, according to Earthjustice attorney Adrienne Lee.","The Trump administration is delaying mandates that would have forced steelmakers U.S. Steel and Cleveland-Cliffs to cut toxic emissions, drawing industry praise and environmentalist dismay.

A July 1 order from the Environmental Protection Agency postpones until April 2027 stricter emissions standards for the country’s integrated steel mills, all of which are run by the two companies.

Another rule set to go out this week delays similar regulations on producing coke, a fuel derived from coal and used to melt iron ore, until July 2027. U.S. Steel and Cleveland-Cliffs make much of their own coke, but also depend on external suppliers.

Taken together, the rules would have slashed the release of chemicals linked to cancer, heart disease and other serious conditions. They were approved by the Biden administration last year and set for gradual implementation starting this month.

Now, the EPA is claiming “serious concerns” the steel industry couldn’t have complied in time, according to documents posted to the Federal Register. The agency also said some aspects of the rules need clarification.

In a statement to TribLive, Amanda Malkowski, a U.S. Steel spokeswoman, criticized the Biden-era rule as detached from established science, available technology and business considerations.

“In addition, implementation of the 2024 rule would have come at exorbitant costs and would have provided little, if any, environmental benefit while significantly impacting American jobs and the nation’s critical infrastructure,” Malkowski said.

Cleveland-Cliffs did not return a request for comment.

EPA data suggests costs would have been relatively low, though.

The agency estimates delaying the rules will produce annual savings of between $4.6 million and $4.9 million. It’s unclear whether this is on a per-company or industrywide basis, but for multibillion-dollar firms like U.S. Steel and Cleveland-Cliffs, the savings are minor either way.

And pushing back the integrated steelmaking regulations alone will lead to an additional 120 tons of hazardous air pollutants, according to the EPA. Facilities emitting at least 25 tons of air toxins a year are deemed by the agency as major polluters.

“All of these pushbacks and rule delays, it further harms the people involved,” said Qiyam Ansari, president of Valley Clean Air Now in Glassport. “Obviously, it’s a win for the industry, but I think it’s a loss for community health.”

Annie Fox, an attorney with the Philadelphia-based Clean Air Council, said it’s typical of U.S. Steel to push back “when any additional regulation is proposed or even discussed” by citing costs burdens.

U.S. Steel previously requested a two-year presidential exemption to the integrated steelmaking and coke rules. The EPA’s latest actions on steel industry emissions have the effect of granting that request, according to Earthjustice attorney Adrienne Lee.

Lee thinks it’s unlikely the more stringent rules will go into effect come 2027.

“It’s just making sure that none of the facilities have to comply with the old rule while they’re trying to work on a new one,” Lee said.

Questioning the process

U.S. Steel’s Mon Valley Works is an integrated operation, handling everything from smelting raw materials to making final products for customers.

These types of facilities rely on blast furnaces, which burn much dirtier than the most common alternative, electric arc furnaces.

So, as the EPA crafted the 2024 rules for integrated mills, area residents and advocates gave ample input. Ansari isn’t sure how much sway local commenters had, but the chance to weigh in was much appreciated, he said.

Ansari and others won’t get the same opportunity this time around.

While the EPA typically collects feedback and then sets regulations, the agency has reversed the order of operations here by using a somewhat rare process known as interim rulemaking.

In short, the rules go into effect, then the agency gets reactions to craft a final version.

Environmental advocates say they knew President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin would be targeting hazardous air pollutant rules for steelmaking. The process through which they did it has added another layer of concern for Hilary Lewis, steel director at Industrious Labs, an environmental organization focused on heavy industry.

“I think what’s frustrating is that community members who are living with this pollution every day have already shown up, have already sent letters, and already told their story to the EPA through the previous public comment period,” Lewis said.

But by skipping over the typical multi-year rulemaking process, the EPA could be opening itself to legal challenges.

The federal Administrative Procedure Act allows agencies to issue interim rules only under narrow circumstances, such as immediate danger to human health.

“This is supposed to be used for real emergencies,” Fox said. “It’s not supposed to be just because it could hurt a company’s bottom line.”",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/07/8655250_web1_ptr-airquality8-042520.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 19:11:14.362492

If were just to maintain that level, not get any worse, what would be the effects on glaciers and sea level?
And the answer to that question is the ice sheets, the polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, they're losing almost 400 billion tons of ice per year.
And that means that their children will then have to cope with 1 meter of sea level rise over 100 years.
So it's unlikely to stop sea level rise in total, but it will stop sea level rise from the big ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, we would hope.","John Yang:

The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change set the goal of limiting global warming by the end of the century to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above what it was before the industrial age. That was thought to be the threshold for averting severe climate change impacts.

But now new research published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment says that even that level is too high to prevent the catastrophic consequences of sea level rise due to melting glaciers. Chris Stokes is one of the authors of that study. He's a professor at England's Durham University where he studies glaciers. Chris Stokes, we're currently at 1.2, as I understand it, above pre industrial levels. If were just to maintain that level, not get any worse, what would be the effects on glaciers and sea level?

Chris Stokes, Professor and Glaciologist, Durham University: So that was actually one of the questions that we tried to answer in our research. And the answer to that question is the ice sheets, the polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, they're losing almost 400 billion tons of ice per year.

And this is a trend that started in the kind of early 1990s. And it's something that we're really worried about because some of the changes we're seeing now in terms of the mass of ice being lost is really quite Dramatic.

Chris Stokes:

Yeah, so at the moment, the global average sea level all around the world is rising at about four and a half millimeters per year. So if you take that four and a half millimeters per year that we're currently experiencing at the moment, and you just carry on at that same rate of acceleration, before the end of this century, we'll hit that kind of 1 centimeter per year.

So that means our young children, who will be living into their 80s and 90s, will be living with sea level rising at a centimeter per year. And that means that their children will then have to cope with 1 meter of sea level rise over 100 years. So this is really quite alarming. As I say, the changes that we're seeing and measuring at the moment are perhaps what we're seeing is the worst case scenario playing out before our eyes.

Chris Stokes:

We probably need to go back to about 1 degree above pre industrial. That's kind of conditions at the late 1980s and, you know, that's what we think will slow down, possibly even stop sea level rise from ice sheets at that kind of warming level.

But you know, that doesn't mean that all ice will stop melting because we'll still have mountain glaciers around the world. Those smaller glaciers will still continue to melt. So it's unlikely to stop sea level rise in total, but it will stop sea level rise from the big ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, we would hope.

Chris Stokes:

Just as an example, there are 230 million people who live within 1 meter of sea level. And there's about a billion people live within 10 meter of sea level. And so for those people, you know, think of all a lot of our largest coastal cities, London, New York, Singapore as well Bangladesh, whole countries who have their land territory within just a few meters of sea level.

Well, this represents an existential threat. You know, this threatens the existence of entire countries and we're talking about widespread displacement of, you know, millions and millions of people at that level.

Chris Stokes:

You know, I wish I wasn't here talking to you today about this, but I think we have to just faithfully report what the observations are showing is what the science shows. You know, people can debate whether to carry on burning fossil fuels. The ice doesn't care. Right. The ice will just melt as it gets warmer.

But part of the message here is that every fraction of a degree really matters. So if we end up at 1.6 or 1.7 degrees of warming, that will be far better than if we end up at 2 or 3 degrees. Part of the message here is like, if countries want to continue burning fossil fuels, and let me be clear, I don't think they should. But if they do, they need to start preparing to invest trillions of dollars in coastal defenses because this problem will not go away.

Decisions taken in the next few years and decades by world leaders at the climate conferences will actually have impacts for several generations, and some of those impacts will be irreversible as well.

Introducing new tax deductions for business and rollbacks of clean energy measures, the bill saw criticism from labor unions concerned about workers and apprentices on renewables jobs. Some contractors and engineering firms applauded the bill for job creation and growth through extended tax reform.

The 900-page legislation included a wide range of tax breaks, spending cuts, money for national defense and deportation, the Associated Press reported. The new law affects nearly every American citizen, with money for the border wall and cuts to Medicaid and SNAP funding.

The legislation has around $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, which lawmakers said was crucial as tax breaks from Trump’s first term were set to expire in December, AP reported. It will solidify the tax cuts approved in the president’s first term.

The SALT cap, which is a deduction limit on payment for state and local taxes, will quadruple from $10,000 to $40,000 through 2029, AP reported.

Clean energy tax credits axed under ‘big beautiful’ bill

A big provision in the bill is cutting tax credits that were designed to boost clean energy projects that used renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. In 2022, former president Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act which focused on addressing climate change by incentivizing the use of renewable energy and electric vehicles.

Different legs of the construction industry have watched IRA closely as the bill included prevailing wage and registered apprenticeship participation for clean energy credits. Around $2.7 billion in tax credits were included in the IRA for clean manufacturing and recycling, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Tax breaks for solar and wind were crucial for labor unions such as the Laborers’ International Union of North America. After the Senate passed the bill, Kent Miller, president and business manager of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council, said on social media the Senate’s version of the bill was a “jobs killer for the wind and solar industry.”

The bill included a provision that will get rid of tax credits for projects if they aren’t completed by 2027, Miller added.

“That means some projects that were counting on those credits may not move forward and that means less job opportunities for our members,” Miller said. “You might say hey, I don’t work in solar, so this doesn’t affect me. But as trade unionists we believe an injury to one is an injury to all. And health and pension funds live and die on growing members and growing more work hours,” he added.

Miller addressed the fact that the legislation included a temporary tax deduction on overtime.

“Not taxing your overtime doesn’t mean (expletive) if you don’t have a job,” he said.

Seven Wisconsin labor leaders representing trades such as painters, sheet metal workers, plumbers, concrete masons and electricians on July 2 took part in a virtual press event to speak out against the “big beautiful” bill and its rollbacks for federal incentives.

The BlueGreen Alliance, a nonprofit bridging labor unions and environmentalist groups that hosted the event, shared that the bill will risk $8.6 billion in private investments and more than 7,000 jobs at risk in Wisconsin.

Andy Buck, the director of governmental affairs for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 7, said clean energy projects put union members to work and gave apprentices a start in the trades. Because of high apprenticeship participation standards, IUPAT saw a record number of apprentices last year, he added.

However, repealing the energy tax credit will mean communities already planning projects according to that credit will have to rethink their plans, Buck said.

Engineering companies applaud the legislation

Before the bill made it to Trump’s desk, the American Council of Engineering Companies leadership on July 3 praised chambers of Congress for passing the spending bill and for its extension of tax laws established under the previous administration.

“ACEC applauds the passage of this critical legislation that will promote job creation and innovation across the U.S. Economy,” said Linda Bauer Darr, president and CEO of ACEC, in a statement. “The extension of the 2017 Tax Law will deliver critical certainty for American businesses. These are pro-growth policies that directly support investment, innovation, and workforce expansion, especially in the engineering sector,” she added.

82% of engineering companies used their tax savings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to hire new employees, data from the ACEC Research Institute showed. Tax savings were also used to invest in technology and expand services, officials added.

Among scores of business-related tax cuts, the legislation will allow businesses to write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.

“In addition, this bill includes a long-sought provision by ACEC to permanently restore full deductibility of R&D expenses for engineering firms,” Darr said. Engineering firms are in the innovation business, designing the next generation of American infrastructure, and it was critical to restore the tax code’s traditional role in incentivizing research and development,” she added.

“As the bill heads to the president’s desk, we commend both chambers of Congress for delivering a package that gives America’s engineering industry the certainty it needs to improve our communities while developing the next generation of engineers. While more work remains, particularly around energy tax policy, this legislation is a strong step forward for America’s future,” Darr noted.

The Associated Builders and Contractors applauded the bill’s signing.

“On this July 4, ABC celebrates Congress and the White House working together to bring this pro-growth tax reform to reality for the millions of hardworking Americans who build and power our economy,” said Kristen Swearingen, ABC vice president of government affairs, in a statement. “This new law provides long-overdue tax certainty that empowers construction businesses to invest in their workforce, expand operations and keep America building,” she added.

The legislation provided certainty to more than 95% of American businesses structured as S corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships, ABC officials said. These businesses employ 62% of the private sector workforce, officials added.

Highlighted reforms included solidifying deductions for small businesses, a permanent increase to the estate tax exclusion amount, restoration of full bonus depreciation and expanding the use of 529 savings accounts for career and technical education in the skilled trades.

“Now that this critical legislation has been signed, we urge Congress and the administration to build on this momentum by enacting additional reforms to reduce regulatory burdens on businesses,” Swearingen said. “Smart, targeted regulatory relief will give contractors even greater ability to create jobs, strengthen their communities and drive economic growth nationwide,” she added.",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2025/07/Depositphotos_90063152_L.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:16:57.158064

Most of America’s transmission lines are more than 50 years old, and date back to the 1950-60s. The American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid a D+ grade. As we use more electronics, build new factories, and continue to grow AI data centers, our electricity demand increases. But our outdated grid cannot keep up.

When the grid fails, it’s not just an inconvenience. Blackouts mean straining hospitals, fire departments, and police, as well as safety threats and lack of heating and cooling during extreme weather. Recent tornados and high winds across the central US this year have shown how a weak grid can leave communities without power for days. Expanded transmission strengthens the grid against extreme weather by creating alternative pathways for electricity to move, giving us the flexibility to handle emergencies by moving electricity from where it’s available to where it’s needed most.

Energy storage also plays a critical role. When used as a transmission and distribution asset, storage can relieve congestion on overloaded lines, provide backup during outages, and reduce the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. By storing electricity during periods of low demand and discharging it when demand spikes or outages occur, storage supports grid stability and enhances resilience.

More transmission also improves efficiency by easing power transfer between regions to meet demand. When power can’t move easily between regions, areas with high demand cannot access cheaper power, leaving households and businesses with higher bills. Expanded transmission networks are the backbone of a strong, affordable, and reliable energy system, letting us tap into the cheapest sources of power. New transmission also makes it easier to bring new resources online, presenting an all-of-the-above opportunity for various energy sources to serve consumers across the country.

Building new or expanded transmission lines not only increases reliability and resiliency, it creates good-paying jobs. Over one million Americans are currently employed in transmission, distribution and storage. Expanding transmission will create jobs in construction, maintenance, and operation. Reliable transmission also attracts manufacturing and new businesses, creating economic growth and job opportunities.

Today, building new transmission lines is slow and complicated, often tangled in red tape between states and regions. We need to update the rules so projects can move forward quickly and fairly. A stronger grid means fewer blackouts, lower bills, and more jobs. It’s a win for families, businesses, and our entire economy. Let’s invest in America’s future by investing in the power network we all depend on.",https://feeds.newsusa.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_size_rss_feed/public/2025-07/shutterstock_134011310.jpg?itok=WeIMvpxY,N,,2025-07-07 20:11:49.325064

The approval, finalized late last month and effective on Aug. 6, applies to a portion of Louisiana’s State Implementation Plan under the Clean Air Act’s “Good Neighbor” provision, which requires states to prevent their air emissions from causing nonattainment of federal air standards in downwind states.

“EPA determines that the Louisiana SIP contains adequate provisions to ensure that the air emissions in the state will not significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance” of the 2010 1-hour SO₂ National Ambient Air Quality Standard, the agency wrote in its final rule.

The EPA’s approval of Louisiana’s plan may also mark one of the final actions under the “Good Neighbor” policy. On March 12, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency would terminate the program as part of what he called “the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history.”

Zeldin argued that the program “expanded federal rules to more states and sectors beyond the program’s traditional focus” and led to widespread rejection of state-submitted air plans. It’s unclear how the rollback will affect already-approved SIPs, including Louisiana’s.

The decision is the result of a 12-year review process. Louisiana originally submitted its SIP revision in 2013 to address the interstate transport obligations tied to sulfur dioxide, a pollutant primarily emitted by industrial sources such as power plants and refineries.

The ruling drew praise from the Louisiana Public Service Commission, which submitted formal comments urging EPA to finalize the decision.

According to the ruling, the LPSC said the decision, “supports cooperative federalism, preserves the LPSC’s authority to regulate retail electric rates and services, and avoids the reliability and cost challenges associated with federal mandates.”

The EPA also received public comments in support of the rule from an anonymous commenter and a Louisiana resident. One citizen applauded the agency’s continued enforcement of the Clean Air Act and warned against rolling back interstate pollution protections.

The ruling does not include the actual comments.

Sulfur dioxide is a toxic gas linked to respiratory problems, especially in children and older adults. But the EPA concluded that Louisiana’s current emissions controls — while not specified in the rule — are sufficient to avoid causing pollution problems in neighboring states.

The action does not impose any new regulations beyond what the state already has on the books. In its response, EPA emphasized that its role is to approve state-submitted plans so long as they meet Clean Air Act standards, not to rewrite or add to them.

Environmental advocates may scrutinize the decision in light of Louisiana’s industrial footprint and ongoing air quality concerns in regions like Cancer Alley. EPA has already signaled plans to strengthen several National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and states may face new SIP deadlines in the coming years.

Any challenges to the final rule must be filed in federal court by Sept. 5 under the Clean Air Act.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/07/4.-Air-monitoriing.png,N,,2025-07-07 17:19:31.121476

“I joined my colleagues in passing the One Big Beautiful Bill to prevent the largest tax hike in American history, lower energy costs, and permanently secure our border,” said Michigan Rep. Tom Barrett, a Republican.","(The Center Square) – In the wake of the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill Act, clean energy groups are warning of potential impacts on Michigan’s auto industry and rising energy costs for consumers.

“This bill is a scorched-earth assault on the health, wallets and future of every Michigander,” said Bentley Johnson, federal government affairs director for Michigan League of Conservation Voters. “At a time when families are battling rising costs, dangerous air pollution and the escalating impacts of climate change, Senate Republicans chose to side with billionaire polluters over the people they were elected to serve. This is legislative malpractice of the highest order.”

On the other hand, fossil fuel advocates are applauding the act, which President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. It cut a number of federal clean energy-related tax credits, including:

• Terminates the energy efficient home improvement tax credit. Under current law, taxpayers may claim that credit of up to $3,200 for certain energy-efficient property purchased and installed into a primary residence before 2033.

• Accelerates the expiration of the zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit by one year to 2031. Under current law, a tax credit is available for qualified nuclear power facilities before 2033.

• Rescinds funding for a low emissions electricity program that provided “education, technical assistance, and outreach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that result from domestic electricity generation and use.”

• Imposes annual federal registration fees on owners of electric and hybrid vehicles, terminating in 2035.

• Repeals the Environmental Protection Agency’s program that awards grants to states, air pollution control agencies, municipalities, and Indian tribes for developing and implementing plans to reduce greenhouse gas air pollution.

This is part of a broader push from Republicans in support of nuclear, coal and fossil fuels, instead of the renewables which Trump has labeled the “Green New Scam.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has signed a number of executive orders “unleashing American energy” and in line with his campaign promise to “drill, baby, drill.”

“America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our nation’s economic prosperity,” stated an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office. “It is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity.”

Yet, clean energy groups are concerned about the “staggering” impact the cuts to clean energy initiatives could have.

“The bill guts nearly all federal investments in clean energy, sending electricity rates skyrocketing and gas prices soaring,” said a statement from the league. “On top of the economic pain, the bill kneecaps Michigan’s ability to build the clean energy infrastructure urgently needed.”

The league also cites a study from Energy Innovation which found that cumulative annual consumer energy costs could increase more than $16 billion in 2030 and more than $33 billion by 2035. For Michiganders, this equates to an extra $120 a year immediately and up to $230 annually within a decade.

“The GOP passed this disastrous budget bill, and everyday Americans will pay the price,” said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. “This bill is a loud wakeup call that the GOP does not value working families.”

Republicans say the act will release consumer choice and pull back on federal red tape in the energy sector.

“I joined my colleagues in passing the One Big Beautiful Bill to prevent the largest tax hike in American history, lower energy costs, and permanently secure our border,” said Michigan Rep. Tom Barrett, a Republican. “This legislation will create thousands of good-paying jobs to boost our economy, ensure the middle class keeps more money in their pockets, and invest in a brighter future for America.”

A statement from Barretts office also promised the act will lower “the costs of gas and electricity for families and businesses by unleashing American energy dominance and increasing domestic mining.”

The American Petroleum Institute, the nation’s largest oil and natural gas trade association, applauded the passage of the act and its “sensible tax policy.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/a3/fa3d3a5c-f478-11ef-a580-a740ef32986d/67bf6d5e46537.image.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:18:52.035409

The Texas flash floods this weekend that left scores dead, including many children, offer a stark illustration.

Here is a look at the intertwined forces that amplified this storm's impact.

'Flash Flood Alley'

Texas's Hill Country sits in an area known as ""Flash Flood Alley,"" explains Hatim Sharif, a hydrologist at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

Warm Gulf air rushes up the Balcones Escarpment—a line of steep hills and cliffs that arcs southwest down from near Dallas—cools, and dumps torrents onto thin soils that quickly give way to bedrock.

Runoff then funnels through a dense web of creeks.

""Water will rise very, very quickly, within minutes or a few hours,"" Sharif told AFP.

The early hours of July 4 proved that.

Around 3:00 am, a gauge near Camp Mystic in Hunt showed the Guadalupe River rising nearly a foot (30 centimeters) every five minutes; by 4:30 am the river had surged more than 20 feet, National Weather Service data show.

That's enough water to sweep away people, vehicles and buildings.

An urgent NWS warning went out shortly after 1:00 am, but most campers were asleep; phones are banned, coverage is patchy, and darkness makes escape routes hard to judge.

Sharif urges the use of hydrologic forecasts that convert rainfall into likely river levels.

""Rainfall needs to be translated into runoff,"" he said. ""If you have 10 inches, what will happen?""

Summer camps have long been drawn to the region for its natural beauty. But with increasing risks, Sharif warns that treating these sites as safe or permanent is unwise.

'We need to adapt'

A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, loading the dice for heavier downpours.

A new analysis by ClimaMeter finds that the meteorological conditions preceding the floods, which delivered more than twice the monthly average rainfall in a single day, could not be explained by natural variability alone.

""Climate change is already affecting us, so we need to adapt,"" said Mireia Ginesta, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford who co-authored the research, which is funded by the European Union and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).

""We also need to cut our emissions, and make sure that proper funding is provided to the forecast services and research in general on climate change.""

The call comes as the National Weather Service, like other agencies, has experienced deep staffing cuts under President Donald Trump's administration.

Experts stress, however, that NWS forecasters performed admirably under the circumstances.

The real failure, wrote climate scientist Daniel Swain on Bluesky, ""was not a bad weather prediction, it was one of 'last mile' forecast/warning dissemination.""

No warning system

For years, commissioners in Kerr County, where the camps lie, considered flood sirens and digital alerts to replace the informal practice of summer camp staff getting on the radio and warning fellow camps.

Minutes from a 2016 meeting show officials labeling even a feasibility study ""a little extravagant,"" suggesting sirens would mainly help tourists, and vouching for the word-of-mouth system.

The debate rolled on. In 2021, commissioners again balked, this time wary of federal funds tied to the Biden administration that they opposed politically.

After the disaster, San Antonio mother Nicole Wilson—who almost sent her daughters to Camp Mystic—launched a petition on Change.org urging Governor Greg Abbott to approve a modern warning network.

""Five minutes of that siren going off could have saved every single one of those children,"" she told AFP.

Most of America’s transmission lines are more than 50 years old, and date back to the 1950-60s. The American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid a D+ grade. As we use more electronics, build new factories, and continue to grow AI data centers, our electricity demand increases. But our outdated grid cannot keep up.

When the grid fails, it’s not just an inconvenience. Blackouts mean straining hospitals, fire departments, and police, as well as safety threats and lack of heating and cooling during extreme weather. Recent tornados and high winds across the central US this year have shown how a weak grid can leave communities without power for days. Expanded transmission strengthens the grid against extreme weather by creating alternative pathways for electricity to move, giving us the flexibility to handle emergencies by moving electricity from where it’s available to where it’s needed most.

Energy storage also plays a critical role. When used as a transmission and distribution asset, storage can relieve congestion on overloaded lines, provide backup during outages, and reduce the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. By storing electricity during periods of low demand and discharging it when demand spikes or outages occur, storage supports grid stability and enhances resilience.

More transmission also improves efficiency by easing power transfer between regions to meet demand. When power can’t move easily between regions, areas with high demand cannot access cheaper power, leaving households and businesses with higher bills. Expanded transmission networks are the backbone of a strong, affordable, and reliable energy system, letting us tap into the cheapest sources of power.

WoodChuck.ai, which launched 18 months ago in Detroit before expanding to Grand Rapids in January, operates what it calls a ""wood waste diversion and renewable clean energy platform.""
Instead of sending wood to landfills, WoodChuck processes it at its Grand Rapids facility into biomass, which is then delivered to partner North Star Clean Energy to generate clean electricity for Michigan.
What the company says sets it apart is its use of artificial intelligence to maximize the value of wood waste.
“Everybody has wood waste,"" Thomas noted.","GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — A Michigan startup is taking on two major environmental challenges at once: overflowing landfills and the growing demand for clean energy. WoodChuck.ai, which launched 18 months ago in Detroit before expanding to Grand Rapids in January, operates what it calls a ""wood waste diversion and renewable clean energy platform."" The company works with construction and manufacturing companies to identify and segregate wood from their waste streams.

""We're really addressing two global problems,"" said Todd Thomas, WoodChuck.ai CEO and founder. “We just have too much waste. Our landfills are filling up, and wood has tremendous value. Our landfills right now, depending on the landfill, they can be 30 to 40% wood by volume.""

Instead of sending wood to landfills, WoodChuck processes it at its Grand Rapids facility into biomass, which is then delivered to partner North Star Clean Energy to generate clean electricity for Michigan.

What the company says sets it apart is its use of artificial intelligence to maximize the value of wood waste. The AI helps pre-sort materials into designated containers and continues to analyze wood quality during processing.

""We use the AI in a couple of different ways,"" Thomas explained. ""Initially we use it upfront to help us pre-sort the materials in our containers. We are getting only the material we want.""

The technology allows them to separate biomass into four different quality tiers.The highest quality wood can be remanufactured into new construction materials, while lower tiers are used for various energy production purposes.

""WoodChuck's secret sauce is by utilizing our AI, we're able to really maximize the percentage of biomass that reaches those highest tiers of quality,"" Thomas said.

The startup's mission comes at a critical time for energy production. According to the company, most experts predict energy demand will double within the next 10 to 20 years.

""We're struggling to keep up with energy demand today,"" Thomas noted. ""So, by taking our what was formerly waste and turning that into energy, it really solves both of those huge problems.“

The company's partnership with North Star Clean Energy, part of Consumers Energy, was instrumental in WoodChuck's formation. According to Thomas, North Star operates three bioenergy facilities in Michigan and needed additional biomass sources to meet growing electricity demands.

The company has been surprised by the strong demand from construction and manufacturing companies, driven partly by what they say is pressure from major clients seeking sustainable solutions.

""Construction companies and manufacturing companies are under more and more pressure from their end clients,"" Thomas said. ""Whether that's Amazon or IKEA or Microsoft or whoever it is that they're building the new building for. Those people want sustainable options.""

The company says it provides detailed reports showing exactly how much carbon was avoided and clean energy produced from each client's former waste materials.

The company says it recently completed a successful seed funding round, which will be used to continue developing its AI platform and expand operations. The Grand Rapids facility serves as both a full-scale biomass processing center and the primary AI innovation lab.

""We're training our AI at scale,"" Thomas said. ""When we start to scale this across other countries and other continents, and people ask, well, will this work at scale? Absolutely it'll work at scale. Come visit our Grand Rapids facility tomorrow and you'll see it working at scale.""

According to Thomas, 99% of construction and manufacturing wood waste in the United States went to landfills last year — tens of millions of tons annually. While the company is focused on its Michigan operations, it sees global potential for its platform.

The disaster has raised hard questions about whether short staffing from DOGE-directed cuts and compelled early resignations at the National Weather Service, or NWS, contributed to the disaster. It’s true that the weather service office at New Braunfels responsible for the warnings had lost 22% of its staff. However, the New Braunfels office had “surge staffing” for the event, with five forecasters instead of the usual two working, according to the Associated Press. And as Bob Henson and I wrote in our previous post, the weather service performed admirably, issuing the proper flood watches and flood warnings.

But we’re pushing our luck if we think the cuts to NOAA, which oversees the weather service, won’t cause a breakdown in our ability to get people out of harm’s way in the future. In particular, the loss this year of many of the weather service’s most experienced leaders – people with decades of experience in the particular weather vulnerabilities in local areas – poses a significant danger to the mission of protecting people and property.

And the dismissal of all probationary NOAA employees earlier this year means that we have eaten our seed corn: There is no incoming fresh blood to replace the old guard. Even if the weather service does start hiring again, it may have trouble attracting talented people. Who would want to work for a government where science is not valued, where you could be suddenly dismissed for no reason with no warning?

Short staffing increases the risk of bad outcomes

As Bob Henson and I wrote at the beginning of hurricane season, massive staffing losses at NOAA from firings of probationary employees, DOGE buyouts, and early retirements have left at least eight of the 122 National Weather Service offices unable to operate around the clock. Because of the loss of staff, regular twice-per-day upper air balloon soundings, which are typically the most important ingredient in making reliable model weather forecasts, have been lost from about 18% of the nation’s upper air stations. Some locations have been reduced to once-per-day launches, and a number are doing no launches at all.

The Washington Post reported that for the month ending on May 26, 17% of all U.S. balloon launches that should have occurred have not, mostly because of NOAA staffing losses. Though it appears that lack of balloon data did not have a significant detrimental impact on the Texas flood forecasts, it is a certainty that this level of data loss will cause significant degradation for some forecasts of extreme weather events – potentially including hurricanes making landfall along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coasts.

New NOAA budget would eliminate the lab that developed a key flash flood forecasting tool

The Texas tragedy has eerie similarities to the flash flood that tore through Colorado’s Big Thompson River on July 31, 1976, killing 144 people. Like the July 4 flood, the Big Thompson flood occurred on a holiday — the Saturday night of Colorado’s centennial weekend — so even more people than usual were camping and recreating in the narrow canyon. While more than 12 inches of rain was falling upstream, forecasters in Denver had no visual access to radar data because of technical difficulties.

The Big Thompson disaster led to awareness tools such as the “Climb to Safety” signs that are common in Colorado canyons. And it stimulated research that led to many of the flash flood warning practices that are now commonplace, including coordination between the National Weather Service and state and local stakeholders that can save lives when a disaster hits.

NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma, has developed and is researching one of the key tools used to make flash flood forecasts: the Flooded Locations And Simulated Hydrographs Project (FLASH), which improves the accuracy, timing, and specificity of flash flood warnings using high-resolution, accurate rainfall observations from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor project. This program was made operational in 2016 after researchers showed it doubled the skill over the legacy weather service flash flood guidance system.

But NOAA’s just-released budget plan for 2026 would close all NOAA labs, including the National Severe Storms Laboratory (which was founded in 1964), and others with similar long histories of innovation and accomplishment. This includes the two labs most instrumental in improving hurricane forecasts, the AOML and GFDL.

The justification for doing so comes from Project 2025, which describes NOAA’s primary research branch, which operates all of these labs – the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research – as “the source of much of NOAA’s climate alarmism.”

As meteorologist Michael Lowry wrote today, “One of the primary tools we use to predict flash floods like the ones in Central Texas come from the Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor System, a project of the National Severe Storms Laboratory or NSSL in Norman, Oklahoma. I’ve zero doubt weather service forecasters were leveraging that tool that evening to issue flash flood warnings. The National Severe Storms Laboratory and associated projects like this one are slated for elimination in NOAA’s proposed 2026 budget, which would be detrimental to our ability to forecast these types of deadly floods in the future.”

NOAA’s new budget would devastate flash flood research

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Saturday, “We know that everyone wants more warning time, and that’s why we’re working to upgrade the technology that’s been neglected for far too long to make sure families have as much advance notice as possible.”

And in comments Monday, she doubled down on this theme, saying that the weather service “has been working to put in new technology and a new system because it has been neglected for years. It’s an ancient system that needed to be upgraded and so President Trump recognized that right away and got to work on it when he came into office in January but that installation is not complete and that technology isn’t fully installed.”

It’s unclear which system Noem may have been referring to. But in reality, the proposed shuttering of the National Severe Storms Laboratory would significantly degrade our ability to improve flash flood forecasting by eliminating the three most promising research programs to do so. These include the FLASH program mentioned above; the Forecasting a Continuum of Environmental Threats (FACETs), a next-generation weather forecast and warning framework for all weather hazards, which will be modern, flexible, and designed to communicate clear and simple hazardous weather information to better serve the public; and Warn-on-Forecast, which aims to increase lead time for tornado, severe thunderstorm, and flash flood warnings.

In his Balanced Weather Substack feed, Alan Gerard, the former director of the analysis and understanding branch at the National Severe Storms Laboratory, wrote on Sunday, “Not only is the administration not doing what Secretary Noem claims, they are clearly doing the opposite, not only with NOAA but other federal science agencies, destroying the research apparatus that would actually upgrade technology and provide more advance notice of horrific events such as this flash flood.”

Wholesale destruction of weather research infrastructure

Why are we cutting NOAA and weather service capability to make lifesaving forecasts at a time when climate change is making extreme rainfall events more frequent and severe? And why are we destroying our ability to do the research needed for the weather service to better forecast extreme rainfall events?

If approved by Congress as it now stands, the latest budget proposal for NOAA will close the government research labs needed to create those tools. And these are not simple cuts, but a destruction of the basic infrastructure needed to do weather research – including hurricane forecasting improvements. This will take years or decades to recover from, even if funding is fully restored next year. It’s like blowing up a dam and trying to rebuild it by gluing the pieces back together. It won’t work. You have to start from scratch.

The rationale the administration has given is that it wants to privatize the National Weather Service. This sentiment is expressed in Project 2025, which claims, “Studies have found that the forecasts and warnings provided by the private companies are more reliable than those provided by the NWS.” To support this notion, Project 2025 cites a 2020 AccuWeather press release. In reality, most private forecasting firms and broadcast meteorologists rely heavily on the weather modeling carried out by the National Weather Service, and the insights from NOAA’s online forecast discussions and other products provide value to the entire weather enterprise as well as interested citizens.

But if we do go ahead to privatize the weather service, there needs to be a plan for an orderly transition to a new forecasting enterprise phased in over a period of years. Otherwise, we risk higher death tolls from extreme weather events because of a lack of warning from hasty, unwise cuts to NOAA and the weather service.

The Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress wanted to gut renewable energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, and that mission was accomplished over the holiday weekend. Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law on July 4. The residential solar tax credit officially ends at the end of the year. FEOC language looms as a potential poison pill for developers and U.S. manufacturers. And according to quotes from lawmakers following the signing, the obstacles for solar developers might not stop at the language in the bill.

From Politico:

Hard-line House conservatives said President Donald Trump assured them his administration would take action to constrict wind or solar projects that qualify for Inflation Reduction Act tax credits — a pledge that ultimately persuaded them to back the party’s megabill.

“We believe the administration is aligned with us on terminating those Green New Scam subsidies. We believe we’re going to get 90-plus percent of all future projects terminated,” said Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, after the megabill passed Thursday. “And we talked to lawyers in the administration. We believe that’s true.”

…

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), another member of the House Freedom Caucus, echoed on CNBC earlier Thursday morning that Trump is going to use his powers “as chief executive” to make sure the companies that apply for solar credits, for example, are “doing what they say when they say they’ve started construction.”

Norman said Trump gave assurances that changes were going to be made, “particularly with getting permits,” although he did not provide further details. And while the president can’t remove the subsidies, Trump’s pledge on enforcement of the changes helped win support from conservatives.

Guess we’ll see on that. For now, here’s a glance at what’s signed into law:

Solar tax credit changes in the Big Bill

We have covered each incremental step of the legislative process, and each draft of the bill seemingly got worse from a solar industry perspective. The following changes to the federal investment tax credits (ITC) are now law:

The tax credit for residential solar (25D) will be terminated by Dec. 31, 2025.

However, the corporate tax credit (45E) is still accessible in residential via solar leases and PPAs – this was not the case in earlier drafts.

For the corporate 45E tax credit, projects must be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2027 to earn the tax credit, with an exception for solar projects that begin construction within 12 months of enactment of the legislation.

Home battery storage would qualify for the 48E tax credit through 2032.

The domestic content percentage was tweaked for this year: 40% if construction began before June 16, 2025; 45% if construction begins on or after June 16, 2025, and before January 1, 2026. 50% if construction begins during the calendar year of 2026, and 55% if construction begins after December 31, 2026.

A last second push for an additional excise tax on solar projects was avoided.

The bill does not terminate rights to transfer energy credits under Section 6418.

Projects that start construction after 2025 would not be able to receive credits if receiving “material assistance” from a Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) aka China. The Material Assistance Cost Ratio is extremely complex, and many in the industry are concerned about how workable this will be in practice.

For manufacturers utilizing the 45X tax credits, any component made with material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity (FEOC) after December 31, 2025 is also ineligible.

For a more in-depth summary, I’d recommend this post from Frost Bown Todd. Or this summary from Novogradac.

Setting up TPO financing

With the 25D tax credit ending, is it time to start selling solar leases? If interested, here’s a crash course in third-party ownership (TPO) solar programs from BayWa r.e. Finance Program Manager Joshua Tinaglia.

Why should solar installers offer third-party ownership (TPO) financing?

Tinaglia: It’s another tool for your tool belt; it’s going to allow you to approach a market, your neighborhood, and have access to maybe two or three more homeowners out of 10 because they didn’t want to take on debt. They didn’t want to do a loan. They didn’t want to put money down or perhaps they’re trying to save money on a monthly basis, and they’re more payment constrained vs. their utility bill. TPO is going to beat a loan all day even with rates having dropped recently.

You’re going to be able to address customers you might not have won before and say I can get you a lower payment than your utility bill by X amount more by using this product. I think that’s really attractive for you, and also gives you another steady revenue stream for folks who are in that category, for areas where that’s going to be more of a concern.

Investments at risk

The new bill puts hundreds of major factories announced or currently being built in jeopardy, threatening $132 billion in investments and 120,000 new jobs in 42 states, according to E2 analysis. The firm reports that businesses have already canceled or closed $15.5 billion worth of investments in new large-scale factories and projects because of the uncertainty around the tax policies.

Solar, wind and batteries, which account for more than 90% of all new power coming onto the grid, will be among the hardest-hit sectors, E2 reports. Projects will be shelved, development will stall, and the energy technologies most capable of keeping up with America’s skyrocketing demand for electricity will be sidelined. That means higher utility bills for families and businesses alike.

Solar industry reaction

Ray Long, President and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE): “We are in a global race – not just for clean energy leadership, but for dominance in the technologies that will define the future, including artificial intelligence. China is aggressively investing in clean energy and digital infrastructure because they understand that energy security and economic competitiveness go hand in hand. This bill should have matched that urgency.”

David Widawsky, Director, WRI US: “While other countries are benefitting from accelerated investment in the clean energy economy, the U.S. is taking a step backwards. H.R.1. will undercut the Administration’s stated goal of ‘unleashing American energy’ and sends a chilling signal to families, businesses and investors alike. Abruptly phasing out clean energy tax credits will raise costs, slow innovation and jeopardize America’s energy security. Electricity demand is growing everywhere—and growing fast. The clean energy cuts in this bill will increase costs and constrain supply at a time when demand for electricity is surging.”

Danny O’Brien, president of corporate affairs at Qcells: “Industry and government have spent more than a decade reshoring the solar manufacturing industry from China to the U.S. Billions of dollars are being invested, the workforce is thriving, and solar energy is meeting the demands for cheap, reliable power. What Congress is advancing toward the President’s desk will harm U.S. manufacturers and invite China to flood our market again with dumped solar panels.

In the near term, the East Coast gasoline market remains a high-reward, high-risk arena where patience and sector-specific insights will be rewarded.","The Colonial Pipeline, a 5,500-mile artery carrying 2.5 million barrels of refined products daily from Texas/Louisiana refineries to the U.S. East Coast, is at the heart of a growing supply chain crisis. As bottlenecks, regulatory shifts, and rising imports collide, the region's gasoline market faces a pivotal moment—one with profound implications for refining margins, consumer prices, and energy infrastructure investments.

The Pipeline's Dilemma: Capacity and Complexity

Colonial's current capacity—2.5 million barrels per day—has been unchanged since at least 2021, despite proposals to boost efficiency by simplifying the mix of fuels transported. The pipeline's operators aim to reduce operational risks tied to “pressure cycling” by limiting the number of fuel types, a move that could stabilize throughput but may not add meaningful capacity by mid-2025. Meanwhile, demand for gasoline and distillates on the East Coast continues to rise, straining an infrastructure system already operating near its limits.

This tightrope act has created a reliance on imports. U.S. gasoline imports from foreign suppliers like Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Europe surged by 15% in 2024, with East Coast refineries struggling to meet regional demand. This influx of foreign product has two effects: it alleviates short-term shortages but also compresses refining margins for Gulf Coast refiners who can't efficiently send their output eastward.

Pricing Pressures: The Refiner's Dilemma and Consumer Impact

East Coast refiners, such as those owned by Phillips 66 (PSX) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC), face a paradox. Their ability to refine crude is constrained by limited access to cheaper Gulf Coast feedstocks, forcing reliance on costlier imported crude. Simultaneously, their gasoline sales are buoyed by supply scarcity—creating a “goldilocks” scenario of high prices and decent margins. For Gulf Coast refiners, however, the story is bleaker: their margins have been squeezed as pipeline constraints limit their ability to capitalize on East Coast demand spikes.

Consumers, meanwhile, are feeling the pinch. East Coast gasoline prices have averaged 10-15% higher than Midwest benchmarks since 2023, a gap widening during summer driving season. This pricing asymmetry could persist unless infrastructure bottlenecks are resolved or imports continue to fill the gap.

Investment Implications: Betting on Infrastructure or Refining Resilience

The Colonial Pipeline's constraints create two clear investment angles:

Energy Infrastructure Plays: Companies like Kinder Morgan (KMI), the pipeline's majority owner, stand to benefit from long-term investments in pipeline integrity, rerouting, or new projects. While KMI's stock has underperformed in 2025 ( ), its role in solving the Colonial bottleneck positions it for a rebound if projects like the proposed Blackcomb Pipeline (2.5 Bcf/day capacity) secure approvals.

Refiners with Strategic Flexibility: East Coast refiners like Valero (VLO) and Phillips 66, which also operate terminals near Colonial's distribution hubs, may thrive if supply imbalances persist. Their ability to blend imported crudes and capitalize on regional pricing premiums could offset broader industry headwinds. Meanwhile, Gulf Coast refiners might pivot toward exports or midstream partnerships to mitigate pipeline limitations.

Risks and Regulatory Uncertainty

The path forward is fraught with risks. Delays in pipeline upgrades—due to regulatory hurdles or construction challenges—could deepen supply gaps. Additionally, the Biden administration's focus on energy security may accelerate investments in alternative transport methods (e.g., rail or barge networks) or incentivize East Coast refinery expansions. Investors should also monitor geopolitical factors, such as OPEC+ production cuts or European energy policies, which could further disrupt import flows.

Conclusion: A Market in Transition

The Colonial Pipeline's capacity constraints are not just a logistical headache—they're a catalyst for structural shifts in the U.S. energy landscape. For investors, the opportunities lie in companies positioned to navigate this transition: those with skin in the game for infrastructure upgrades and refiners capable of thriving in a fragmented market. As the East Coast becomes increasingly dependent on foreign supplies, the stakes for resolving this supply chain crisis—both for consumers and investors—are higher than ever.

For a diversified play, infrastructure ETFs like AMJ offer exposure to pipeline operators and terminal owners, though they require a long-term view. In the near term, the East Coast gasoline market remains a high-reward, high-risk arena where patience and sector-specific insights will be rewarded.",,N,,2025-07-07 17:20:09.102007

Congress passed House Resolution 1 (the Act) after the House placed its final stamp of approval on the reconciliation package in a 218-214 vote. In the final stages of the legislative process, the Act nearly faltered. Hold outs in the Senate and the House threatened to derail the Act’s passage, but intense negotiations and arduous midnight conferences ultimately led to the Act surviving floor votes in both chambers of Congress and advancing to President Donald Trump’s desk. In this FORsightsTM article, Forvis Mazars explores the key provisions in the Act and how they may impact taxpayers.

The “Big Three” Tax Provisions

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) enacted several business tax provisions that helped fuel economic growth. Among those provisions were three tax issues commonly dubbed as the “big three”: bonus depreciation, research and experimental expense deductions, and business interest expense deductions. The Act amends these provisions with an aim toward stimulating domestic economic growth as described in the SFC’s description of the bill.

Bonus Depreciation

Under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 168(k), “bonus depreciation” had allowed for an immediate and full deduction of depreciation expenses related to qualified property placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023. After this cutoff, the bonus depreciation allowance gradually phased out by 20% each year until it reached zero beginning in years after 2026. The Act changes this and permanently extends the depreciation deduction and allows for 100% expensing in the year placed in service for qualified property. Additionally, the Act allows taxpayers to elect to utilize a reduced rate of 40% or 60% depending on the kind of property for the first taxable year ending after January 19, 2025. The change to bonus depreciation will apply to qualified property placed in service after January 19, 2025.

The Act also temporarily allows nonresidential real property used in manufacturing, production, or refining of tangible personal property to qualify for bonus depreciation through 2030 if it meets certain requirements. This nonresidential real property must be used in manufacturing activities that “substantially transform” tangible personal property to qualify for this application of bonus depreciation..

Research & Experimental Expensing

In another move aimed at stimulating domestic investment, the Act permanently reinstates the deduction of domestic research and experimental expenditures (REEs). The current legislation requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize domestic-sourced REEs over a five-year period while foreign-sourced REEs are capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period.

The Act allows for the deduction of domestic REEs in the year incurred while still capitalizing and amortizing foreign-sourced REEs. As an alternative, taxpayers may choose to consider certain domestic REEs as deferred expenses similar to the rules described by IRC §174 before its amendment by the TCJA. As an offramp for taxpayers capitalizing domestic REEs over the past several years, the Act permits taxpayers to accelerate remaining amortization deductions over a one-year or two-year period. Lastly, small businesses with average annual gross receipts of $31 million or less can retroactively deduct their domestic REEs applicable to years beginning after December 31, 2021. The Act requires taxpayers to reduce their domestic REEs by the allowable Credit for Increasing Research Expenditures (R&D credit) or elect the reduced R&D credit under IRC §280C, which effectively restores the mechanics of IRC §280C to its pre-TCJA state.

Interest Deduction

The business interest deduction under IRC §163(j) makes up the last member of the “big three.” Under current legislation, the business interest deduction is limited to the combination of the total of the taxpayer’s business interest income during the year, 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and the taxpayer’s “floor plan financing interest.” Floor plan financing interest consists of interest on debt used to finance motor vehicles.

The Act provides a more favorable calculation of the interest deduction by adjusting the calculation to use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization (EBITDA) rather than EBIT. It also modifies the definition of motor vehicle to include certain campers and trailers. Proponents of the Act hope that broadening the interest deduction will make it easier to purchase equipment and facilities that will stimulate economic growth.

Insight from Forvis Mazars: Taxpayers that qualify to amend their return to retroactively deduct domestic REEs under the small business allowance in the Act should proceed with caution. Filing an “amended return” in this scenario may trigger unexpected issues in particular while submitting an Administrative Adjustment Request (AAR).

SALT Cap

One of the most contentious items in the reconciliation package was the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions paid by a taxpayer. The law had allowed taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local taxes with the cap on the deduction sunsetting after 2025. Members of Congress negotiated for a deal that raises the SALT cap to $40,000 in 2025. For 2026 through 2029, the cap increases by 1% each year. The cap reverts back to the original $10,000 limit for all tax years after 2029. Lawmakers included a phaseout for all taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $500,000. Taxpayers must decrease their SALT deduction by 30% of every dollar exceeding the phaseout threshold.

Insight from Forvis Mazars: Different versions of the legislation contained provisions targeting so-called pass-through entity tax (PTET) work arounds with the SALT deduction. The Act does not include any changes to the handling of PTET in relation to the SALT deduction.

International Tax Items

On the international tax side of things, the Act made modifications to the GILTI, FDII, and BEAT regimes.

GILTI and FDII: The Act adjusts the effective rates of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) by decreasing the applicable deduction percentages. Thus, increasing the rates for FDII and GILTI to 14%. In addition to these changes, the Act contains various alterations to each of these calculations regarding expense apportionment and the elimination of the 10% return on QBAI. Further, GILTI will now be referred to as Net CFC Tested Income (NCTI) and FDII will now be referred as foreign derived deduction eligible income (FDDEI).

BEAT: The Act increases the tax rate from 10% to 10.5% and retains the current law ability to utilize credits in the calculation. It maintains the base erosion threshold of 3%.

Proposed §899: The proposed provision that would enact retaliatory taxes against countries levying “unfair foreign taxes against the United States” was removed from the Act. Read more about the deal surrounding this provision in this alert.

Clean Energy Credits

Credits: The Act repealed many of the clean energy credits enacted by or adjusted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. For solar and wind property, early iterations of the Act proposed aggressive rollbacks that required energy projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment to take advantage of the investment and production tax credits. For these credits, the final version of the Act softened this proposal by positing that qualifying projects placed in service before December 31, 2027 (and which begin construction before 12 months after the Act’s enactment), would receive 100% of the available credits. The Act also repealed most credits related to electric vehicles and residential property.

Energy-Efficient Buildings: Under current law, taxpayers can deduct expenditures related to the construction of energy-efficient buildings on square footage basis under §179D. The Act terminates this deduction for properties that begin construction after June 30, 2026.

Insight from Forvis Mazars: Considerations for foreign entities of concern were included in the Act for many clean energy tax credits. Taxpayers may find themselves with property that no longer qualifies for a tax credit based on their vendors, deal structure, or other factors. Further, if purchasing a tax credit, transferees should proceed with additional assurances that the property meets the requirements of the Act.

Compensation & Benefits

One of the major promises put forth by President Trump during his campaign for president centered around no taxes on tips and overtime. Current law includes tips and overtime in W-2 wages, which are taxed accordingly via income and employment taxes. The Act eliminates the taxes on tips and overtime to a certain amount.

No Tax on Tips: The Act allows a deduction limited to $25,000 of qualified tips. The Act limits eligibility for the deduction to taxpayers that work in historically tipped occupations as of December 31, 2024. This deduction for tip income is available to itemizers and taxpayers claiming the standard deduction. Lawmakers define qualified tips to be cash tips given voluntarily at an amount up to the payer’s discretion that is not subject to negotiation in each proposal.

The Act excludes highly compensated individuals from taking the deduction. It carves out highly compensated taxpayers by using a graduated phaseout for taxpayers with MAGI exceeding $150,000 (or $300,000 for joint returns). This deduction for tip income will sunset December 31, 2028.

No Tax on Overtime: The “no tax on overtime” provisions nestled in the Act follows a similar methodology as the tips provisions by providing a deduction for overtime compensation. The Act limits this deduction for qualified overtime compensation up to $12,500 (or $25,000 for joint returns). In this case, qualified overtime compensation consists of compensation above the regular rate in exchange for working more hours than the standard set forth in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA).

The Act precludes highly compensated individuals from claiming the overtime deduction. According to the Act, taxpayers with MAGI above $150,000 wishing to deduct overtime compensation are subject to a graduated phaseout of the deduction. The no tax on overtime provision is scheduled to sunset after 2028.

Insight from Forvis Mazars: Even though the Act removed taxation on tips and overtime, it still requires these income streams to be reported separately on the W-2. The IRS will update withholding tables if the deductions were enacted. An open question is whether cash tips includes tips paid by an app.

""There are more than a half a million Californians who work in clean energy, solar, wind, energy efficiency, electric vehicles,"" Keefe reported.","As part of the Trump administration's new budget, Arizona's burgeoning solar industry faces the elimination of tax incentives that have encouraged people to invest in renewable energy.

Despite being one of the sunniest places on the planet, Arizona only generates about 10% of its power from the sun - but tax credits that were designed to increase that share have been largely eliminated in the federal budget.

Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy with the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the move will have consequences for the renewable energy industry - not just in Arizona, but nationwide.

""It has really devastating impacts,"" said Gallagher, ""not just to the solar industry, but to American energy security and national security. Solar energy is putting more new power on the grid than every other fuel source combined in the last several years.""

Arizona generates about 6,100 megawatts of electricity from the sun, still far less than other states that have made larger investments in solar power infrastructure.

Despite an abundance of sunny days, Arizona policymakers have long shied away from a large-scale shift to generating power from the sun.

While more solar arrays have been developed, much of the investment has been by small, private companies installing residential systems.

Gallagher said the political climate - both in Phoenix and Washington, D.C. - has shifted away from supporting alternative energy, despite its economic benefits.

""Every dollar spent on clean energy tax credits has a $2.67 return,"" said Gallagher, ""in the form of lower energy costs for consumers, and taxes paid by clean energy infrastructure projects - mostly property taxes.""

Renewable energy got short shrift in the budget bill passed by Congress last week and a New Mexico trade association said companies and their employees will suffer.

The bill quickly phases out tax incentives and investments for wind and solar power passed under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

Jim DesJardins, executive director of the Renewable Energy Industries Association of New Mexico, said both consumers and businesses in the solar industry have made huge investments due to the incentives.

""There's people who've got loans on their homes, and overnight this bill is going to pull the rug out from underneath them,"" DesJardins asserted. ""This will destroy thousands of businesses, will put tens of thousands of people out of work, for what? Why are we doing this?""

Since passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, a boom in renewable energy has led to more than $300 billion in spending. Another $500 billion dollars was allocated for clean energy projects but those could now be abandoned.

New Mexico is the second-largest crude oil producer in the U.S. and with more than 300 days of sunshine, it is considered among the top 10 states for potential solar development. Most experts are not predicting a collapse in the renewable energy industry but without federal subsidies and tax credits, solar and wind farms could become more expensive.

After signing a contract, DesJardins pointed out it can take years to get a solar project off the ground and Trump's new bill would let incentives expire before the end of 2027.

""There's just so much uncertainty for a large solar project you can't say, 'Oh, we're going to put it into operation on this day.' It just doesn't work like that,"" DesJardins stressed. ""We need to stop this herky-jerky way of doing policy whether it's for farmers, whether it's for renewable energy, it's just very counterproductive.""

Despite the setback to wind and solar, DesJardins believes renewable industries will persevere, one way or another.

After being debated for days, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, are among those who voted to advance the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" to push President Donald Trump's agenda forward.

Curtis was one of a handful of Republicans who wanted to preserve clean energy tax credits but the Senate made major cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar projects. Now, the bill does not allow for a project to get the tax credit if it does not begin producing electricity by 2028.

Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the change could reverse years of progress and innovation.

""It has really devastating impacts,"" Gallagher emphasized. ""Not just to the solar industry, but to American energy security and national security. Solar energy is putting more new power on the grid than every other fuel source combined in the last several years.""

Curtis was able to remove a provision that would've enacted a new tax on solar and wind projects and ended a ban on solar leasing. While Curtis expressed gratitude to Senate leaders for including his changes, Gallagher hopes the concessions do not hinder the industry's ability to meet demand. The budget bill now goes back to the U.S. House for what could be the final vote.

Projects started before the bill is enacted would be protected from penalties and setbacks. Current projects would also retain all of their tax-credit value through December 2027. Gallagher argued the tax credits, passed under the Inflation Reduction Act, are working.

""Every dollar spent on clean energy tax credits has a $2.67 return in the form of lower energy costs for consumers, and taxes paid by clean energy infrastructure projects, mostly property taxes,"" Gallagher pointed out.

The Trump administration has called for energy dominance and so far has focused on supporting more development of fossil fuels over renewable energy. And while wind and solar energy are still popular across the board, recent polling indicates some people, especially Republicans, are less supportive of renewable energy than in Trump's first term.

Groups representing workers in the renewable power sector are slamming the possible repeal of clean-energy tax credits in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" currently before the U.S. Senate.

The bill would repeal tax credits for solar and electric cars, part of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a national organization of business leaders who advocate for smart clean-energy policies, said the bill could crush the clean-energy economy and not just in blue states such as California.

""If we ever wanted a policy in this country that would kill jobs, reduce business investments and make us less competitive, while also reducing our electricity supplies in this country, we've got it,"" Keefe contended.

In the past three years, companies have announced more than $130 billion in clean energy projects. Trump campaigned against the tax credits and wants to put the savings toward an extension of his 2017 tax cuts. A new report from E2 showed since Trump took office in January, companies have canceled more than $15 billion worth of projects.

Keefe pointed out California has the most clean energy jobs in the country, so it has the most to lose.

""There are more than a half a million Californians who work in clean energy, solar, wind, energy efficiency, electric vehicles,"" Keefe reported. ""When you take away a 30% tax credit for building solar projects, sales are naturally going to decrease, projects are going to get canceled and jobs are going to be impacted.""

Data show more than 75,000 Californians work in the electric vehicle industry. The bill eliminates the $7,500 EV tax credit which makes EVs more affordable. If the bill passes it would have to be reconciled with the House version and reapproved before it reaches the President.

Owned by Canadian energy company Enbridge, Line 5 stretches from northwestern Wisconsin, through the Upper Peninsula, into lakebed in the Straits of Mackinac where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet and down into the lower peninsula ending in Sarnia, Ontario.

Transporting more than 22 million gallons of light crude oil and natural gas liquids daily, activists have called the pipeline a ticking time bomb, pointing to a July 2010 spill, where Enbridge’s Line 6B ruptured, releasing 840,000 gallons of crude oil into Talmadge Creek, which flows into the Kalamazoo River.

Watershed Aware, a limited liability corporation that says it was founded by a group of concerned citizens, on July 3 placed along I-75 in Gaylord the first of what it says will be several billboards in an effort to “help Michigan citizens understand more clearly the impacts and costs of Enbridge’s proposed Line 5 Tunnel Project.”

Enbridge identified gaps in Line 5’s protective coating in 2014, while a 2018 anchor strike dented the pipeline in three places, intensifying concerns about the pipeline’s safety. In 2018, Enbridge announced an agreement with the state to relocate the two segments of the pipeline into a new section, housed in a concrete-lined tunnel buried beneath the bedrock of the Straits of Mackinac.

The project has since received necessary permits from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and the Michigan Public Service Commission, while the United States Army Corps of Engineers moves forward under emergency processing in line with President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order instructing federal agencies to utilize the corps’ emergency permitting provisions “to the fullest extent possible” to facilitate the nation’s energy supply.

The Corps issued its draft environmental impact statement on May 30, with Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy telling the Michigan Advance the company’s goal in constructing the tunnel is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint.

“The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the [draft statement] to further refine the project,” Duffy said.

Public comment on the statement closed on June 30 with several environmental organizations arguing the review failed to consider the pipeline’s long-term impacts on climate change, while calling for a more detailed review of the geology of the lakebed as well as a consideration of alternatives to the tunnel.

The company is also working to redo several permit applications with the Department of Great Lakes Environment and Energy, including its Water Resources Protection, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, which aims to limit the amount of pollutants discharged into surface waters.

The billboard posted in Gaylord calls attention to the permit’s request to discharge 5 million gallons per day of various wastewaters associated with tunnel construction and drainage as well as groundwater seepage, and storm water into Lake Michigan.

However, Duffy said conditions for water use and return to the environment are dictated by a separate National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit issued by the department that authorizes discharges of water in a manner that will not adversely impact Lake Michigan’s water quality.

Watershed Aware said in its statement that they are working to raise funds for billboards along the I-75 corridor, which leads up through Mackinaw City across the Mackinac Bridge into the Upper Peninsula.

Alongside concerns about the tunnel project’s environmental impacts, members of Michigan’s Tribal Communities raised concerns on how the construction process will impact cultural sites and ancestral remains.

A recent investigation from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Enbridge potentially escaped federal review of land that tribes say is likely to have items of cultural significance through a land swap with Michigan’s Emmet County, with County later paving over the plot in 2023.

“While people are celebrating their 4th of July, the alleged freedoms and rights that were fought for. The Indigenous people of Michigan are fighting a tunnel that is being built for Canadian gains and profits, their plan is to desecrate tribal ancestral remains that have been buried for thousands of years on both sides of the Straits of Mackinac. This proves that we are not free nor do we have rights, even in death. This is disgraceful,” Andrea Pierce, chair of Anishinaabek Caucus and a citizen of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, said.

Pierce was among a group who in 2020 identified a submerged cultural site just a short distance from Line 5.

Duffy said Enbridge has conducted surveys in the Straits at the direction of and in consultation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers which is responsible for consulting under the National Historic Preservation Act to assess potential impacts to historic properties The details of those surveys were provided to the corps. However, Enbridge is unable to provide information on the findings due to confidentiality agreements.

Duffy also noted that Tribal representatives were consulted as part of the corps’ efforts to assess the project’s effects on historic properties, noting that the corps consulted routinely with Tribes over the course of the last five years.

In the first quarter of 2025, the company would have reported a loss if not for credit sales, which rose 35 percent year over year to $595 million, the Times notes.

“That relief lasted a very short time and now has a taken a turn for the worst with this latest announcement.” Keep in mind, Tesla’s sales were already plummeting, thanks to Musk’s side hustle with DOGE.
Meanwhile, Musk’s spat with Trump has only accelerated Tesla’s brand crisis.","Tesla used to be the envy of the auto world, with sky-high valuations, a relentless focus on tech, and a CEO that commanded unprecedented loyalty from his customers.

Now the company’s reputation is in shambles, its financial future looks increasingly grim, and its costly bets on AI and robotics are unlikely to pay off anytime soon. Weirdly, CEO Elon Musk has only just “woken up” to the mounting crisis on his doorstep. That’s according to an unnamed “former Tesla executive,” who told the Financial Times that Musk has only just now come to terms with the damage his political activities are creating for Tesla.

The passage of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” seems to have been the final straw for Musk, who vehemently opposed the bill, calling it “an abomination” on the basis that it would balloon the national deficit. The bill, which was signed by Trump over the weekend, would eliminate tax credits for EV purchases, zero out fines for automakers who exceed fuel-efficiency targets, and roll back other incentives for wind and solar power.

Musk was so steamed about the bill’s passage he declared his intention to create a third political party. But its Tesla that will bear the full brunt of the bill’s repercussions.

Weirdly, CEO Elon Musk has only just “woken up” to the mounting crisis on his doorstep

“This is terrible policy and a devastating blow for Tesla’s bottom line,” the executive told the Times. “It’s not just [the EPA’s CAFE standards] in a vacuum — it’s everything together: tariffs, the $7,500 consumer credit, manufacturing tax credits, charging credits and solar residential credits… Elon has finally woken up to this, but talk about a day late and a dollar short.”

Tesla stands to lose billions of dollars in regulatory credit sales as a result of the bill’s elimination of penalties for automakers who exceed emission standards. In the first quarter of 2025, the company would have reported a loss if not for credit sales, which rose 35 percent year over year to $595 million, the Times notes. The company is now scrambling to shore up regulatory credit sales in Europe and elsewhere to account for the loss in the US.

You have to feel sorry for the Tesla bulls on Wall Street, who just last week were celebrating a slightly-less-terrible-than-expected production and delivery report (only a 14 percent drop in sales, that’s not so bad!), only to run smack-dab into Musk’s declaration of the “America Party.” Tesla shares dropped 7 percent in early trading on the news of Musk’s further political entanglements.

”After leaving the Trump Administration and DOGE there was initial relief from Tesla shareholders and big supporters of the name that Tesla just got back its biggest asset, Musk,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note today. “That relief lasted a very short time and now has a taken a turn for the worst with this latest announcement.”

Keep in mind, Tesla’s sales were already plummeting, thanks to Musk’s side hustle with DOGE. But the company’s finances were being kept afloat by regulatory credits — which will now all but disappear with a stroke of Trump’s pen.

Meanwhile, Musk’s spat with Trump has only accelerated Tesla’s brand crisis. Democrats, many of whom were once Tesla owners and supporters of the company’s environmental mission, have already soured on the brand as Musk grew closer to Trump. And now that he’s on the outs with the president, the company’s reputation is plummeting among Republicans. Which begs the question: who will be left to buy Tesla’s cars?

As usual, Tesla’s board has been silent on all these points. As investors continue to moan about the CEO’s thinly spread attention, the board has done exactly nothing to curb Musk’s activities. Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm vehemently denied a Wall Street Journal report from earlier this year that a CEO search to replace Musk was underway. If the company starts logging quarterly losses, we should expect those rumors to surface anew.

Musk himself seems to be on increasingly shaky ground. Trump has threatened to retaliate against him further by canceling lucrative government contracts with SpaceX and Starlink. And he has even suggested he would be open to deporting Musk — although on what legal grounds it remains to be seen.

Investors assumed that Tesla was better positioned than other automakers to weather the tough roads ahead, after Trump’s triumph made clear that EV incentives and credit sales would be on the chopping block. They didn’t anticipate how quickly the alliance between the two notoriously mercurial figures would dissolve.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/gettyimages-2203624618.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.735628002593%2C100%2C78.528743994814&w=1200,N,,2025-07-07 17:16:45.335696

“The land is alive again.” Tyner Pond Farm sells directly to customers through its website, offering free delivery across Central Indiana.","Just over a decade ago, Chris Baggott was a driving force behind one of Indiana’s most successful tech startups. As co-founder of ExactTarget, later acquired by Salesforce, Baggott helped revolutionize digital marketing. But today, you’re more likely to find him walking the pastures of Tyner Pond Farm in Hancock County, where he’s spearheading a different kind of revolution: regenerative agriculture.

“We wanted to do something real, something physical that would positively impact our environment, health and community,” Baggott says. “Philanthropy for us became about action, not just writing checks.”

Founded in 2010, Tyner Pond Farm began with 275 acres of overworked corn and soybean land. Today, they manage nearly 1,000 acres across six farms with a single goal: restoring life to the soil.

Baggott’s pivot from tech entrepreneur to farmer may seem unlikely, but his entrepreneurial spirit has been key to Tyner Pond Farm’s success. “It’s very different from software,” he says. “In tech, you can just scale by spinning up another server. On the farm, we have fixed resources—acres, animals and time. But the mission is the same: creating something that empowers people.”

Inspired by Michael Pollan’s “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” and a TED Talk by ecologist Allan Savory, Baggott became passionate about regenerative agriculture. This method emphasizes restoring soil health through natural processes, such as rotational grazing. In regenerative agriculture, the focus is not just on sustainable practices but on actively improving the health of the land. “Savory’s talk changed how I thought about animals and the land,” Baggott says. “It’s not that animals destroy the earth. It’s how we manage them that matters.”

At Tyner Pond Farm, cattle and chickens aren’t just products but tools for regenerating soil biology. Baggott’s son, Jim, leads daily operations, meticulously planning grazing patterns months in advance. Temporary fencing allows them to move the animals frequently, mimicking natural herd migrations and giving pastures time to rest and regrow.

“The goal isn’t to raise cattle,” Baggott says. “The goal is to build soil. Healthy soil leads to healthy plants, animals and people.”

It’s a system that takes time, often up to seven years, for depleted land to recover, but the results are striking. “Where the soil was once dead, now we see biodiversity: insects, birds, native grasses,” Baggott says. “The land is alive again.”

Tyner Pond Farm sells directly to customers through its website, offering free delivery across Central Indiana. “You don’t need to buy half a cow,” Baggott says. “You can shop like you would at any grocery store, just with better food.”

Transparency is at the heart of the farm’s philosophy. Visitors are welcome at any time, and Baggott often shares photos and updates on social media. “We’re the opposite of industrial agriculture,” he says. “There are no locked gates. No secrecy. You should know where your food comes from.”

Customers visit Tyner Pond Farm sites for various reasons, including environmental concerns, support for local businesses and an interest in nutrition. And yes, many say the meat tastes better. But the biggest surprise is how buying premium meat can actually save money.

“One woman told me her grocery bill went down after switching to us,” Baggott says. “When food is nutrient-dense, you eat less. You’re not snacking constantly because your body is being nourished.”

The idea that food is medicine is becoming more central to Tyner Pond Farm’s message. “We’re focused on nutrient intensity,” Baggott says. “Our animals live longer, eat real grass and are never treated with antibiotics or vaccines. It’s a totally different product than what you find at the store.”

Despite their success, Baggott isn’t interested in endless expansion. “We’re not trying to be the biggest,” Baggott says. “When we sell out, we refer customers to partner farms.” These partnerships are helping other farmers transition from commodity crops to regenerative livestock, using Tyner Pond Farm’s customer base and processing infrastructure as a support system.

“It’s about changing the model,” Baggott says. “We’re proving that small, local and sustainable is viable. And once people experience the difference—whether in taste, health or principle—they don’t go back.”

Baggott sees the rise of direct-to-consumer farming as part of a broader shift comparable to the digital music revolution. “It used to be you got your food from whoever had shelf space. Now, with the internet, people have a choice. Just like Spotify empowered musicians, this empowers farmers.”

Baggott measures success not by sales volume but by its impact on the community and its contributions to ecological healing. “If more people eat locally, eat better and support farms that regenerate the earth, we all win,” he says. This impact on the community includes providing healthier food options, supporting local economies and promoting environmental stewardship. It’s about more than just selling meat; it’s about creating a healthier, more sustainable food system for everyone.

Enhanced geothermal involves drilling deep underground through hard, hot, and impermeable rocks to form an underground reservoir.
Compared to conventional geothermal energy, which is limited to regions with natural superheated reservoirs such as The Geysers in California, enhanced geothermal can be deployed anywhere with hot rocks close enough to the Earth’s surface.
Despite its potential, enhanced geothermal has been overlooked in most energy systems models, partly because the first pilot-scale commercial project in the United States came online only a few years ago.
Even if today’s policies were repealed, the researchers found that enhanced geothermal might still find a large market in the western U.S.","A once-overlooked technology that taps into the Earth’s heat to generate electricity could supply up to 20% of the electricity in the United States by 2050, according to a new Princeton analysis.

Published June 4 in Joule, the study found that if the costs of deploying enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) fall as more of the technology is implemented — following trends observed in other energy technologies — then it could emerge as the third most significant clean energy technology behind wind and solar.

With today’s federal policies in place, the analysis demonstrated that over 250 gigawatts of enhanced geothermal could be deployed by 2050 if the technology can be implemented at baseline or lower-than-expected costs. By comparison, today’s grid has a total capacity of around 1,200 gigawatts.

With more ambitious federal policies, such as a net-zero by 2050 policy, even the most expensive cost estimates for enhanced geothermal led to over 500 gigawatts of deployment by 2050, including in areas east of the Mississippi River historically seen as low-quality geothermal resources.

“Assuming that support for clean firm power from the Inflation Reduction Act remains in place, we found that EGS could very plausibly become a very large percentage of electricity generation across the entire United States,” said first author Wilson Ricks, a postdoctoral researcher at the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. “Planners and policymakers should be taking it seriously as a technology.”

How does enhanced geothermal work?

Enhanced geothermal involves drilling deep underground through hard, hot, and impermeable rocks to form an underground reservoir. Then, cool fluid is pumped into the reservoir at one well and extracted as hot fluid from another. The hot fluid is used to spin a turbine and generate electricity.

Compared to conventional geothermal energy, which is limited to regions with natural superheated reservoirs such as The Geysers in California, enhanced geothermal can be deployed anywhere with hot rocks close enough to the Earth’s surface.

Despite its potential, enhanced geothermal has been overlooked in most energy systems models, partly because the first pilot-scale commercial project in the United States came online only a few years ago. At the same time, cost estimates for the systems depend both on the price of the drilling technology and the rock’s depth and temperature, making it more complex to model than other technologies.

“Unlike with solar, we can’t just look at satellite imagery to determine the best possible sites,” Ricks said. “We need to have people actually dig underground and confirm whether the temperatures and geology are suitable.”

A pathway to commercialization for enhanced geothermal

According to Ricks, enhanced geothermal could have an easier pathway for gaining a foothold in the energy market compared to technologies like advanced nuclear and carbon capture that could similarly provide around-the-clock clean energy. That is because the technology could be able to leverage high-quality geothermal resources to get the first few projects off the ground.

While first-of-a-kind plants for all new technologies are almost always expensive, the price of building more plants typically falls over time as companies gain more skills and experience through a phenomenon known as a learning curve.

At the same time, enhanced geothermal’s reliance on hot rocks yields a kind of resource curve: it is cheaper to deploy where those rocks are close to the surface, such as much of the western United States, and more expensive in areas east of the Mississippi River where hot rocks are farther underground.

Thus, siting first-of-a-kind plants near the best thermal resources could help to offset higher initial building prices, allowing EGS to gain an early footing over similar technologies that would pave the way for commercial liftoff across the country.

Even if today’s policies were repealed, the researchers found that enhanced geothermal might still find a large market in the western U.S. However, they noted that continued federal support is likely critical for allowing the technology to become relevant at a national level.

“The early part of the learning curve, where a technology is at its most expensive and is vying for initial market uptake, is where government support has the greatest impact,” said research leader Jesse Jenkins, an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. “Continued federal support will be critical for enabling large-scale commercialization of EGS and other emerging technologies.”

While the researchers pointed out that they made assumptions about technology learning rates for EGS that might differ from real-world data, they said their paper is the most empirically grounded and robust cost analysis of EGS to date. They also said their work will be improved as researchers gain a better sense of EGS technology costs and a more precise understanding of subsurface rock temperatures across the country.

“For a long time, it has been models and simulations and theory,” Ricks said. “Now, there’s actual steam coming out of the ground, with pilot scale projects already operating and 100 megawatt projects hopefully coming online soon. We have a lot more information about the technology now than even a few years ago, and we’ve used that information to show that EGS could be a significant player in the future energy system.”",https://engineering.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Fervo-Energy_Cape-Station_2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:17:04.695463

Introduction

The One Big Beautiful Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, 2025, includes extensive energy provisions to overhaul the clean energy credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which are estimated to raise approximately $499 billion in net revenue from 2025–2034.

The legislation will eliminate numerous energy credits including all the clean vehicle credits, residential clean energy and energy efficiency credits, and clean hydrogen production credit by the end of 2027, and other credits several years later, with various phaseout schedules. Together, these provisions are estimated to raise about $543 billion from 2025–2034.

The legislation also expands some energy provisions such as clean fuel production credit and advanced manufacturing credit, which are estimated to cost about $44 billion over the same period.

Overall, the OBBBA’s energy provisions do not make much progress in conforming the IRA’s energy credits to the good-tax-policy principles of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability. See a previous American Action Forum (AAF) paper for a detailed analysis of the energy credits and an evaluation of them against the principles of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability.

The OBBBA’s energy provisions include simplicity and efficiency enhancing provisions such as those that eliminate the poorly designed clean vehicle credits, standardize credit rates for different qualified energy technologies or components, and retain the refundability and transferability features. The legislation also contains complex and inefficient provisions that restrict taxpayers’ full access to the credits, such as expanding the foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules and using an arbitrary approach to pick winners and losers across various energy technologies.

This paper provides an overview of the legislation’s changes to the IRA energy provisions and evaluates the energy provisions against three good-tax-policy principles of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability.

Summary of the OBBBA’s Changes to the IRA Energy Provisions

The OBBBA overhauls the IRA energy provisions in the following areas. (See detailed information on expiration dates, exceptions, and special rules in the table in appendix.)

Eliminates some credits: The legislation repeals all the new, used, and commercial clean vehicle credits, alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, residential clean energy and energy efficiency credits as soon as after September 30, 2025, with some of them expiring after June 30, 2026. It also repeals the clean hydrogen production credit after 2027.

Brings expiration dates forward: The legislation brings forward most of the expiration dates for wind and solar in the clean electricity production credit, clean electricity investment credit, and advanced manufacturing production credit to December 31, 2027. It also makes the permanent advanced manufacturing production credit for critical minerals temporary, starting its phaseout in 2031 and fully eliminated four years later.

Strengthens foreign entity of concern restrictions: The legislation significantly expands the foreign entity of concern (FEOC) provisions by prohibiting taxpayers from getting “material assistance” from a “prohibited foreign entity,” which includes a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign-controlled entity.” The FEOC provisions also include specific restrictions regarding a “foreign-influenced entity.”

Removes emissions-related targets: The legislation eliminates the emissions-related conditions that determine the expiration dates for clean electricity production and clean electricity investment credits. Instead, both credits start to phase out in 2034 and are repealed fully by 2036.

Expands the scope of certain credits: The legislation expands some energy credits, including by extending the clean fuel production credit from 2027 to 2029, adding a new production credit for metallurgical coal equal to 2.5 percent of production costs, and adding a new energy community bonus credit of 10 percent to the clean electricity production credit for advanced nuclear facilities.

Makes limited changes to some credits: The legislation retains the energy credits for carbon oxide sequestration and nuclear power production mostly as detailed in the IRA and adds only FEOC restrictions to them.

Retains transferability, refundability, and most bonus credits: The legislation retains transferability and refundability for the credits and other special bonus credit requirements including domestic content rules, prevailing wage bonus, and apprenticeship bonus.

Evaluating the OBBBA’s Energy Provisions

Simplicity, Efficiency, and Fiscal Sustainability

The IRA uses tax subsidies to encourage the production of clean energy. Although the income tax is not the best approach to addressing climate change, energy tax credits should follow the principles of good tax policy. Ideally, tax policies should be simple, efficient, and fiscally sustainable. This allows the federal government to incentivize clean energy development without imposing unnecessary burdens on taxpayers and the economy. A previous American Action Forum (AAF) paper on the IRA energy provisions provides a detailed analysis of the credits and uses a framework of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability to evaluate them. The three principles are defined as follows:

A simple tax credit is one that makes it easy for the government to implement clean energy tax incentives and the taxpayers to utilize them, keeping both administrative and compliance costs low.

An efficient tax credit would ensure that eligible taxpayers can utilize clean energy tax credits as much as possible to help drive the economy’s transition to clean energy technologies. It should also limit the extent to which the tax incentives distort producers and consumer behaviors in ways that impose additional costs. It is worth noting that there is a tension between efficiency of clean energy tax credits and the conventional meaning of tax efficiency, as clean energy tax credits are designed to change taxpayers’ behaviors and encourage them to switch to the consumption of clean energy technologies.

A fiscally sustainable tax credit is one that limits budgetary costs and can ultimately be financed through a low level of taxation.

Simplicity

The IRA’s tax credits were designed with excessive complexity. Many of the energy tax credits have multiple requirements that significantly limit eligible taxpayers to a specific group of businesses or individuals, which requires regulators to allocate more resources to screen and verify eligibility and taxpayers to incur a larger burden to comply with the requirements.

Tax credits can be simple to administer and utilize if they have universal provisions. If they are designed to subsidize certain taxpayers or economic activities, however, the complex eligibility requirements could substantially increase administrative and compliance costs.

The OBBBA significantly simplifies the design of the energy provisions by eliminating the poorly designed clean vehicle tax credits. AAF’s analysis finds that the clean vehicle credits’ onerous eligibility requirements, income thresholds, and bonus credit rules make them complicated for regulators to implement and difficult for taxpayers to claim the full credits. Indeed, AAF concluded in its previous analysis that the clean vehicle credits fail against all three principles, as they are complex, inefficient, and costly.

Additionally, the OBBBA surgically improves the simplicity of some energy provisions by standardizing credit rates for different qualified energy technologies or components. For example, for the clean fuel production credit, the legislation reduces the credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel to conform to the rate applicable to other eligible transportation fuels. For the advanced manufacturing production credit, the legislation eliminates the permanent feature of the critical minerals credit and changes it to the same expiration and phaseout schedule as most other eligible components.

The OBBBA adds restrictions and requirements to the energy credits, however, making them more complex to claim than necessary. A striking example is that the legislation expands the IRA’s FEOC restrictions significantly to prohibit eligible taxpayers from being directly or indirectly associated with any specified or defined foreign entity of concern. The new FEOC provisions apply restrictions in several ways. A prohibited foreign entity cannot claim the credit. Eligible taxpayers cannot source their input materials from a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity. Additionally, eligible taxpayers cannot enter into a licensing agreement with a prohibited foreign entity. The legislation also adds a new 10-year recapture special rule to the FEOC restrictions. For example, for the clean electricity investment credit, eligible taxpayers are prohibited from transferring payments to a specified foreign entity over a 10-year retroactive period. This rule goes into effect in the tax years beginning two years after the enactment of the OBBBA. The new FEOC restrictions substantially increase the complexity of implementing, interpreting, and utilizing the credits.

The OBBBA retains some of the complex special rules in the IRA, including the domestic content rule and prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. For example, for the clean electricity investment credit, the OBBBA modified the domestic content rule to make it harder for taxpayers to claim the credit by increasing the percentage of eligible products that must be produced in the United States. This requirement may be challenging to comply with as the United States has been relying on certain imported goods as components for energy products and it is more costly to produce them domestically.

Efficiency

The IRA clean energy credits have a combination of features that make them efficient in some ways and less inefficient in others.

The OBBBA retains the efficiency-enhancing features of refundability and transferability. These provisions allow taxpayers to fully utilize the credits for which they are eligible. For example, a startup carbon capture technology company is not typically profitable in its first few years of business, which means that it does not have any taxable income or tax liability, so it cannot use any standard tax credits to reduce its tax liability. With refundability and transferability, the company can either get a refund (a direct payment) from the government as if it had a tax liability or sell the tax credit to another business for cash. Retaining the transferability feature applies to one of the good-tax-policy principles of efficiency, but the OBBBA adds significant FEOC restrictions to prohibit businesses from transferring credits to a specified foreign entity, which reduces the efficiency of the credits and limits taxpayers’ access to claim the credits.

As discussed above, the legislation greatly improves the efficiency of the energy provisions by repealing the inefficient clean vehicle credits. These credits subsidize consumers who would have bought a clean vehicle anyway, and do not incentivize consumers to use electricity generated with clean energy for their vehicles.

In contrast, OBBBA’s arbitrary approach to different types of energy technologies reduces their efficiency considerably. Overall, the legislation favors baseload energy (capable of running continuously), such as nuclear, geothermal, and hydropower, over other intermittent energy sources, including wind and solar. For example, the clean electricity production and investment credits will expire for wind and solar much sooner than for other types of clean energy. The advanced manufacturing production credit is also repealed for wind energy components several years earlier than for other eligible components.

Additionally, the legislation’s energy provisions do not seem to follow any principles of good tax policy. While the carbon oxide sequestration credit and the nuclear power production credit from the IRA are mostly retained in OBBBA, the clean hydrogen production credit will be eliminated after 2027. The clean fuel production credit is extended by two years, whereas the advanced manufacturing production credit for critical minerals is changed from permanent to temporary.

A perplexing modification in the OBBBA’s energy provisions is that it adds a new production credit for metallurgical coal, equal to 2.5 percent of production costs, under the advanced manufacturing production credit. Metallurgical coal is primarily used as a raw material for manufacturing steel, which is sold at a much higher price than thermal coal used for electricity generation. The United States is a major producer of metallurgical coal globally and most of the U.S. metallurgical coal products are for exports.

To price the externalities of greenhouse gas emissions and encourage transition to clean energy technologies, tax subsidies should ideally be as technology neutral as possible, meaning that they subsidize all clean energy technologies equally if they lead to the same amount of emissions reduction. Overall, there is significant room to improve the efficiency of OBBBA’s energy provisions as they arbitrarily pick winners and losers across different energy technologies.

Fiscal Sustainability

The IRA’s clean energy provisions were initially estimated to cost $400 billion from 2026–2035. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) later estimated that the cost of the provisions is more than double, at $870 billion.

Table 1 shows JCT’s estimate of how much revenue the OBBBA’s energy provisions would raise. The termination and restriction of the energy provisions will raise about $543 billion from 2025–2034. The expansion of some of the energy provisions will cost about $44 billion over the same period. On net, all the OBBBA’s energy provisions will raise a total of $499 billion from 2025–2034.

AAF previously estimated that repealing all the energy provisions in the IRA would raise $852 billion from 2026–2035. The OBBBA’s energy provisions will raise approximately 60 percent of the total revenue if the legislation were to fully repeal all the energy provisions.

""If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.""","The Trump administration's Department of Energy (DOE) on Monday released a report that found currently scheduled retirements of energy-generating facilities coupled with delays in bringing new power sources online could lead to a rise in blackouts by the end of this decade.

DOE's report found that with about 104 gigawatts of energy-generating capacity scheduled to be retired by 2030, power outages could see a significant rise if that capacity isn't replaced in a timely manner. It is estimated that annual outage hours could rise from single digits today to over 800 hours per year.

The agency noted that while 104 GW of power generation is scheduled to be retired, it is scheduled to be replaced by 209 GW of new capacity by 2030 — though only 22 GW of that comes from firm baseload generation sources. It added that even with the assumption of no retirements, the risk of outages in some areas rises more than 3-fold.

""This report affirms what we already know: The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas,"" Secretary Scott Wright said in a statement.

The report said electricity demand is rising in part due to the construction of energy-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) data centers along with advanced manufacturing facilities.

""In the coming years, America’s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power,"" Wright said.

Additional information Press release from advocates Federal Judge Stays Freeze on Federal Funding for EV Infrastructure Judge orders lifting of Trump administration’s ‘unlawful’ EV charging funds freeze","On May 22, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy joined a coalition of environmental, consumer, and community organizations to challenge the Trump administration’s unlawful and indefinite freeze of billions in federal funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. In 2022, Congress allocated $5 billion for the program through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to build electric vehicle charging stations every 50 miles on major corridors across all 50 states. However, in February, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), acting on behalf of the Trump administration and in violation of the Constitution, halted the funds from flowing with the issuance of a memorandum. The impact of these frozen funds to our region is significant. The Southeast’s portion of the funding totals over $ 679 million.

NEVI funds are critical to increasing access to charging in the Southeast

The NEVI program was designed to increase access to high-speed charging infrastructure along the interstate system and build confidence among American drivers that electric vehicles can function just as reliably as internal combustion vehicles for long-distance travel.

The fast charging network is not evenly nor densely distributed enough to currently achieve that goal. This is especially true in the Southeast. Currently, the Southeast lacks access to charging stations, with only 0.40 charging stations per 1,000 people. This lack of accessible charging keeps consumers from having the confidence to purchase and drive electric.

The NEVI funding to increase the number of high-speed charging stations is critically important to the Southeast for several reasons.

Southeast states have significantly underinvested in charging station deployment as a region. These formula funds would guarantee investment and increased access for EV drivers in our region.

The Southeast has long stretches of highway in rural areas currently without access to highway charging stations. Just like the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) increased access to electrical power in rural America, NEVI would increase investments and economic opportunities to rural areas.

Many of the electric vehicles (EVs) that the NEVI network would support are built in the Southeast. In fact, the Southeast is home to 31% of the national total labor force that manufactures EVs.

The region relies heavily on tourists and snowbirds who require access to fast charging while driving an EV long distances on the highway. This funding would provide up to 80% of the funding to install charging that would help meet this need.

Coalition Seeks to Restore Funds

Funds need to be restored so infrastructure that supports the freedom to choose healthier, lower-cost transportation is available to every American — especially for Southerners, particularly in rural communities, without access to reliable, high-speed charging.

“We’ve spent years working to accelerate transportation electrification across the South — where clean mobility is critical for climate, health, and economic opportunity,” said Stephen Smith, Executive Director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “The NEVI Program is one of the most practical tools we have to help states build reliable, accessible EV charging where it’s needed most. Suspending it puts hard-won progress at risk and leaves Southern communities without the resources to lead in the transition to clean energy.”

The Federal Highway Administration and Department of Transportation acted without authority and illegally by refusing to disperse funds allocated by Congress.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO), an independent non-partisan agency that works for Congress, agrees with this assessment of the situation. The watchdog recently found that the February Federal Highway Administration memo, directing freezing the NEVI Formula Program funds violates the Impoundment Control Act. However, the White House has subsequently ordered the Department of Transportation, the department where the Federal Highway Administration sits, to ignore the GAO ruling.

Judge Orders Resumed Funding Distribution

On June 25, a federal judge in Washington issued a preliminary ruling ordering the Trump administration to restore NEVI Formula Program funding, unlocking about $1 billion in federal funds while the case moves forward. The order did not take effect until July 2 to provide the federal government an opportunity to appeal, which they did not. The order restores funding for 14 of the 17 Plaintiff States. The judge found that three states, Minnesota, Vermont, and the District of Columbia, did not provide sufficient evidence on how the freeze harmed them to qualify for relief. While the ruling is not a final decision, it’s a big win and forward momentum for the states getting EV charging projects moving forward. Read additional details in the joint press release from the NGO coalition.

SACE and allies are still awaiting a ruling on the motion to intervene. The coalition will continue to seek the nationwide restoration of NEVI funds to build EV charging stations along highways in every corner of the country.

According to Springfield City Solicitor Stephen Buoniconti, Springfield was the only community in the state to receive such an award.
“The city of Springfield was left with no recourse but to sue the federal government to enforce the $20 million EPA grant,” said Buoniconti.
“Gradual improvements have been made to asthma and lead exposure rates and the grant will benefit the health of every resident of the city,” Buoniconti said.
“We are optimistic that the Public Rights Council will best represent the city’s interests.”","SPRINGFIELD — The fight for clean air continues as Springfield is one of many listed in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for the president’s recent termination of Environmental Protection Agency grants.

The city joined several other nonprofits, tribes and local governments in suing the administration for what they say is an unlawful termination of the EPA’s Environmental and Climate Justice Grant programs “despite a congressional directive to fund them.”

Earthjustice, Southern Environmental Law Center, the Public Rights Project, and Lawyers for Good Government filed the challenge on behalf of ECJ grant recipients to seek the restoration of the nationwide program and to require the reinstatement of awarded grant agreements, according to a press release from Earthjustice.

The 23 plaintiffs involved in the lawsuit are seeking to restore the $3 billion that was promised to “community-driven” projects across the country. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is the defendant in the case.

According to court documents, the case is being taken up at the U.S. District Court level.

“EPA’s termination of the program is unlawful,” the lawsuit reads. “It violates bedrock separation-of-powers principles by effectively repealing a congressional enactment and impounding funds based on nothing more than the President’s disagreement with policies Congress duly enacted.”

The Environmental and Climate Justice Program was created by former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act under Clean Air Act Section 138 to award $3 billion in grants to community-based nonprofits, according to Earthjustice.

Springfield was supposed to receive $20 million of that money to fund a community solar project, complete home rehabilitation projects, plant 1,500 trees throughout the city and retrofit 30 one-to-four-unit homes to improve indoor air quality.

Additionally, the money would support a workforce development program for HVAC-R technicians and convert two city-owned buildings to non-grid clean energy sources while expanding their use as community resilience hubs and emergency shelter locations.

According to Springfield City Solicitor Stephen Buoniconti, Springfield was the only community in the state to receive such an award.

But that money and other grants were eliminated across the country in early 2025 as part of Trump’s efforts to downsize the role of the federal government in energy and environmental spaces.

“The city of Springfield was left with no recourse but to sue the federal government to enforce the $20 million EPA grant,” said Buoniconti. “We are pleased to partner with … the Public Rights Council and others in filing the lawsuit to recover the grant monies.”

According to the lawsuit, the plaintiffs are seeking class action certification and preliminary relief so that all 350 grant recipients harmed by the termination can continue their “community-based initiatives.”

Buoniconti said the Public Rights Project is representing Springfield “at no cost to the taxpayer.”

“Unlawfully ending this program threatens the ability of local governments to protect their people and the environment,” said Jon Miller, chief program officer for the Public Rights Project. “This case isn’t just about restoring grant funding in a handful of places — it’s about restoring critical services and projects in areas of the country with the greatest need.”

In Springfield’s case, the elimination of this money would likely be a lethal blow to a city that was dubbed the “asthma capital of the country” in 2019, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, and was named the fourth most challenging place to live with asthma as of 2024.

Furthermore, Springfield also lost out on a $1 million grant from EPA for asthma prevention support, and the City Council is currently appealing a recent ruling by the Massachusetts Appeals Court that gives more life to a controversial biomass plant proposal by Palmer Renewable Energy: tinyurl.com/54ad2896.

Despite the dour outlook, Buoniconti remains optimistic about retaining the EPA money.

“Gradual improvements have been made to asthma and lead exposure rates and the grant will benefit the health of every resident of the city,” Buoniconti said. “We are optimistic that the Public Rights Council will best represent the city’s interests.”",https://cdn.thereminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20230623_085212-scaled-e1741629652363.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:17:14.720040

For example, anthropologist Jason Hickel recently published a now-viral map displaying how, by the year 2070, two billion people will be residing in regions exposed to extreme, potentially unlivable heat.

Approximately 99.7% of those people will be in the Global South, a grouping of poor, formerly colonized nations primarily in Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia that are responsible for less than 20% of historical carbon dioxide emissions, meaning the people who have contributed the least to planetary warming will be the ones who suffer the most from it.

Though the United States is a wealthy country firmly entrenched in the Global North, there are rarely discussed yet very similar class dynamics playing out within our nation’s borders, including in Memphis.

What’s happening in Memphis?

Once a green energy advocate, tech billionaire Elon Musk shifted his focus to the artificial intelligence arms race and established “Colossus” in Memphis in 2024. An xAI supercomputer facility designed to power and train Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, Colossus is slated to be the world’s largest supercomputer.

But at what cost? The facility is currently operating 33 methane-powered gas turbines to fuel its AI technology despite holding a permit for only 15. The supercomputer facility is located in a poor, predominantly Black Memphis community with historically high rates of pollution-related illness and disproportionate rates of industrial pollutants.

The magnitude of the energy draw — and resulting pollution — at Colossus is, well, colossal. According to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), the facility draws enough electricity to power approximately 100,000 homes while consuming 1.5 million gallons of water per day to cool its equipment.

Those inputs are alarming, but the outputs are even worse. The facility’s behemoth methane gas turbines increase Memphis’s smog by 30-60% as they belch planet-warming nitrogen oxides and poisonous formaldehyde around the clock, pollutants linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Quoting SELC, “xAI has been operating dozens of unpermitted methane gas turbines without public notice, permits, or air pollution controls. The number of turbines and extent of their emissions likely make xAI the largest industrial source of smog-forming pollutant in Memphis.”

It’s worth mentioning that clean air is both a Constitutional right, according to the 9th Amendment, and a human right, as per the United Nations; yet, Memphis leadership has looked the other way as Colossus produces more nitrogen oxides than Shelby County’s Draslovka chemical plant, the Valero refinery, TVA’s Allen power plant, and the Memphis International Airport combined.

South Memphis is becoming a sacrifice zone

“It’s no coincidence that if you are African American in this country, you’re 75% more likely to live near a toxic hazardous waste facility,” said state Rep. Justin J. Pearson, a Memphis Democrat, in a recent interview. “It’s no accident that in this community, we’re four times more likely to have cancer in our bodies. It’s no accident that in this community, there are over 17 Toxics Release Inventory facilities surrounding us — now 18 with Elon Musk’s xAI plant.”

Despite vocal opposition from South Memphis residents and their defenders, these neighborhoods are beginning to look like “sacrifice zones,” or poor, predominantly Black communities that are willfully poisoned and polluted for the interests of power and wealth.

How long before South Memphis looks like Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, a stretch of communities along the Mississippi River where a slew of dangerous petrochemical facilities have led to the predominantly African American neighborhoods presenting cancer rates at up to 50 times the national average? Or Flint, Michigan, where the preventable 2014 water crisis caused lead contamination that disproportionately affected the region’s mostly low-income population, leading to several deaths and thousands of lifetime disabilities?

The people who contribute the least to environmental harm often suffer the most from it

Although it varies by region, poor Americans produce approximately 10 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. In contrast, wealthy Americans have significantly larger carbon and pollution footprints due to their consumption patterns, investments, and lifestyle. One study found that the wealthiest 10% of Americans account for at least 40% of emissions.

Yet, despite their disproportionate contribution to the problem, the wealthy can afford to insulate themselves from the harms associated with living on an increasingly warm and polluted planet.

For example, Musk’s private jet flights alone produce approximately 5,497 tons of carbon dioxide per year, which is equivalent to the amount produced by around 550 residents of South Memphis in a year. Every time Musk’s SpaceX launches another rocket (currently about 140 per year), add another 3,189 tons of CO2, or the annual carbon footprint equivalent of 319 South Memphis residents. Musk’s Boring Company, initially pitched as a sustainable alternative to above-ground automobile traffic, is likely to produce tunnels that, car for car, produce eight times more CO2 emissions than roads.

Yet Musk will never have to suffer the environmental harms created by his businesses and lifestyle.

Memphis’s future should be decided by those who live there, not an out-of-state billionaire

Laws like the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used to make a not insignificant attempt at insulating poor American communities from the environmental implications of class dynamics, but all of that could change with Supreme Court rulings gutting environmental laws and DOGE-mandated cuts to the EPA.

What’s happening in Memphis is a painful example of America’s shift to a law-of-the-jungle society in which a billionaire can flaunt already gutted and barely enforceable laws and then operate an unpermitted, clandestine, mass-polluting supercomputer facility simply because no one has the resources, power structures, or political will to stop him.

By streamlining workflows and de-risking projects, AI-enabled automation tools significantly accelerate the deployment of BESS solutions.
Faster, more efficient installation of energy storage means more renewable energy can be integrated into the grid without compromising its reliability.
For EPC firms, automation provides a critical competitive advantage.
For developers and operators, it unlocks greater value from renewable energy assets.","The clean energy transition is accelerating, with renewable sources such as solar and wind energy leading the charge. Due to its intermittent nature, renewable generation is increasingly coupled with Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), which not only increases utilization and corresponding financial revenues but also contributes to grid stability and resiliency. Energy systems researchers estimate that decarbonizing the electric grid will likely include a massive deployment of BESS, as the cost and performance of lithium-ion batteries continue to improve and alternatives such as sodium-ion and iron-air batteries gain ground. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), for instance, foresees that the installed capacity of energy storage in the United States will scale from 26 GW in 2024 to 175 GW by 2050, highlighting the critical need for efficient deployment methods.

For the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) firms responsible for deploying BESS in a competitive market, speed and efficiency are paramount. These firms are, therefore, increasingly turning to automation to streamline the complex process of designing and sizing BESS projects.

This shift to automation is profoundly impacting the vital early stages of project development, especially in bidding and initial design. Previously, crafting competitive bids was a tedious process that required extensive manual calculations. Nowadays, advanced automation tools can quickly analyze market data, operational parameters, and potential revenue from energy arbitrage to generate optimised, competitive bids. A study in Germany demonstrated algorithms that can determine optimal pricing and operational strategies, enabling EPC firms to craft competitive bids that maximize value for both developers and operators. This capability allows EPC firms to respond to opportunities with increased speed and accuracy, providing a significant advantage as utilities and major corporations increase their demand for clean electricity to power the growth of data centers and other commercial facilities.

Beyond the bidding process, automation is revolutionizing the engineering and design workflow. Web-based platforms and digital twins allow engineers to create dynamic, data-rich models of BESS projects. These virtual environments facilitate real-time simulations and performance analysis under various conditions, reducing the need for costly and time-intensive manual generation of design alternatives. Engineers and researchers frequently use such simulations to test optimal component sizing and dispatch strategies for various applications, from industrial peak shaving to residential use, refining system designs long before deployment and ensuring that the final layout is optimised for performance, reliability, and cost.

The value of a well-designed BESS is ultimately proven through its market performance. An optimally sized and configured system can more effectively participate in energy markets, providing opportunity for ancillary services such as frequency regulation and energy arbitrage. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly deep reinforcement learning, have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach for optimizing energy arbitrage, allowing BESS to learn the best trading strategies from market data, while accounting for physical constraints such as battery degradation. Benchmark results from a 2020 study, based on historical UK wholesale electricity prices, show that a proposed deep reinforcement learning method improves profits from energy arbitrage by 58.5% compared with the standard mixed integer linear programming method.

Ultimately, these digital capabilities have powerful implications for the broader energy transition. By streamlining workflows and de-risking projects, AI-enabled automation tools significantly accelerate the deployment of BESS solutions. Faster, more efficient installation of energy storage means more renewable energy can be integrated into the grid without compromising its reliability. This creates a virtuous cycle where the growth of renewables and BESS mutually reinforce each other.

While challenges in data integration and model accuracy remain, the benefits of automated BESS design are clear. For EPC firms, automation provides a critical competitive advantage. For developers and operators, it unlocks greater value from renewable energy assets. For policymakers and the broader public, these digital tools provide an easily overlooked but powerful avenue to accelerate the transition to a cleaner, more resilient energy system.",https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-1475540621-aspect-ratio-1280-225-1200x630-c-default.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 18:15:02.086669

Heat networks, which distribute low-carbon heat from a central source to various buildings, present an effective solution for decarbonising heat at scale.

We hosted a roundtable discussion at our Citigen site, bringing together a diverse group of MPs from across the political spectrum – all members of the Parliamentary Renewable and Sustainable Energy Group (PRASEG) – along with the Association for Decentralised Energy (ADE) to delve into the transformative potential of heat networks in accelerating the transition to low-carbon heating.

Insights from the roundtable highlighted:

Heat networks could be game changers for cities and towns, especially in dense urban areas and places with access to waste heat – such as from factories, data centres, even sewers. They offer a practical, proven way to cut carbon and boost efficiency.

This growing sector could unlock more than £100 billion in investment and deliver 50,000 new jobs for communities across the UK.

New regulations and the introduction of ‘zoning’ to plan where heat networks are best deployed, would drive steps towards a more coordinated, consumer-focused approach.

Local communities stand to gain from more affordable, lower-carbon heating.

The key topic under discussion was waste heat and the fact that so much heat from industrial uses is currently lost but could in future be used as significant – and affordable – source of energy across the capital.

But while the future looks promising, there are still challenges to address. One of those is in mandating buildings to connect to heat networks is crucial to instil investor confidence in constructing the new infrastructure and to promote waste heat sharing.

At the same time, increased investment is vital. Public financing, alongside enhanced incentives, will play a pivotal role in unlocking private funding streams. Robust regulation is also a necessity to bolster consumer trust and prevent unnecessary delays.

The MP discussion also heard that new legislation was expected soon, meaning there’s a real opportunity to make clean, low-carbon heat the standard across the UK.

One such project currently being explored, and being supported by E.ON, is how to create a ‘heat transmission line’ from where energy is generated, right into the centre of the city of London.

Under the plans, this pipeline would be about 11 miles (16km) in length, travelling from northern Kent on the banks of the Thames into the City of London to connect to existing heat networks or other large heat consumers. It could also provide heat for others along the way.

In a move towards a greener future, leveraging waste heat sources through heat networks can not only decarbonise heating but also drive economic growth, create jobs, and enhance energy security for cities and communities. Through collaborative efforts and strategic investments, the vision of cleaner, more sustainable urban environments powered by heat networks is within reach

Caroline Bragg, CEO of the ADE, said: “If you look, for example, at the Green Heat Network fund which is the main grant programme supporting the industry at the minute. . . of the jobs that we've created through that funding, about 60% of them are created locally, cannot be offshored. Those are local jobs being created in our cities and towns that will last for decades as we build these heat networks out.”

Mark Garnier, MP for Wyre Forest and the Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury, (below, left) said: “Thinking about heat as a third way of delivering energy, you start by being imaginative about where you get it from – collecting it from data centres, from power stations, from cement factories, from steel works, and on it goes. In Denmark, they take it out of sewerage, they take it out from wherever they can find heat they and that's why it suits them.”

Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday signed the tax and spending cut bill Republicans muscled through Congress this week, turning it into law by his own self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.

At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations.

Democrats united against the legislation, but were powerless to stop it as long as Republicans stayed united. The Senate passed the bill Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It passed the final version Thursday 218-214.

Here’s the latest on what’s in the bill and when some of its provisions go into effect.

GOP bill includes reductions for businesses and new tax breaks

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump’s first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill, solidifying the tax cuts approved in Trump’s first term.

It temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. There’s also a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year, a nod to his pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It’s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. Proponents say this will boost economic growth.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, and the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House’s version.

The ‘big beautiful’ bill slashes clean energy tax credits

Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden’s 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs.

Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”

A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.

Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

GOP bill funds the border wall, deportations and a missile shield

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump’s border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

Medicaid, SNAP face deep cuts to fund bill’s tax breaks and spending

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There’s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.

But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.

The bill creates ‘Trump Accounts’ — and funds a national hero garden

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The bill creates a new children’s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There’s a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. The tax is equal to 1% of the transfer.

A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated.

One provision bars for one year Medicaid payments to family planning providers that provide abortions, namely Planned Parenthood.

Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation’s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

State AI regulations cut from bill after a GOP uproar

The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.

A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.

The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.

Final price tag: GOP bill could add $3.3 trillion to deficit

Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.

Democrats say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country’s fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.”",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2025/07/AP25184750414912-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:17:36.979190

“We know that the federal government is going to be completely useless in our efforts to clean the air, despite rhetoric claiming they care about clean air.
For trucks, California enacted two rules, one in 2020 and then one in 2023 that would phase out new diesel trucks by 2042.
Conservatives say the air board is an unelected board that wields too much power.
Experts and advocates say California will have to approach clean air policy from many angles — mandates and incentives.","At an electric vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Christopher Grundler — one of the top executives in California responsible for cleaning the air — said despite all the setbacks his agency has faced this year, he’s confident the state can keep making progress.

“This president, this Congress, will not kill the electric car,” said Grundler, a deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources Board. “They won't kill the electric truck, and they certainly won't kill the California spirit.”

Despite that optimism, California officials — now reined in by the Trump administration and growing concerns about affordability and costs — are struggling to come up with new ways to clean up the nation’s most polluted air.

Lacking federal permission to set aggressive emission standards for the first time in almost 60 years, California may be left mainly with voluntary agreements with the auto, trucking and rail industries, and subsidies to entice consumers into buying electric vehicles.

Congress last month revoked the state’s authority to implement three landmark rules that ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and phase out diesel trucks. In addition, California was forced to abandon four other ambitious rules for zero-emission trucks, locomotives and commercial harbor craft because the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency would be unlikely to grant waivers.

Those seven mandates, now unenforceable, were key to cleaning up the pollutants that leave about 34 million Californians regularly breathing unhealthy air. In another blow to California’s efforts, Congress and President Donald Trump eliminated tax credits for consumers who buy electric cars.

At the same time, California’s air quality rules are facing growing pushback from the public, industry — and even some Democrats in the Legislature — because of the impacts on gas prices and other economic concerns.

Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, in an interview with CalMatters, did not offer any details on how the agency will make up for the voluminous tons of smog-causing gases and soot those rules would have eliminated.

“There's no one strategy that's going to work. It's really going to need to be a suite of different things,” Randolph said. The governor and Legislature will help decide “what strategies are going to be the most effective, the most cost effective, the most likely to be able to scale up,"" she said.

The air board is hosting four meetings in the coming weeks to hear ideas from industry groups, environmentalists and community members about how the state should now approach clean air regulation.

In an executive order last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom directed the air board to develop a new zero-emission car mandate — apparently in preparation for when the state either wins its lawsuit against Trump or when he leaves office.

Newsom also ordered the air board to develop a plan by Aug. 11 to keep expanding California’s market for electric cars and trucks. As part of the plan, the state agency must consider ways to improve charging infrastructure and offer incentives.

“We know that the federal government is going to be completely useless in our efforts to clean the air, despite rhetoric claiming they care about clean air. State and local governments are going to have to do more,” said Adrian Martinez, an attorney with the San Francisco-based environmental group Earthjustice.

“We just have to go it alone.”

Heart and lungs at stake

It’s been a long, bumpy road to cleaning up exhaust from California’s 36 million vehicles. Gas-powered cars and diesel trucks remain the state’s largest sources of smog and soot despite decades of cutting emissions.

Much of that pollution is inhaled by the most vulnerable Black and brown communities near ports, highways and warehouses. Ozone, a smog-causing gas, and fine particles of soot are linked to premature deaths from heart attacks and respiratory diseases, and increased emergency room visits.

For six decades, a provision in the Clean Air Act has granted California the power to set its own vehicle standards that are stricter than the federal government’s because of the state’s unique and severe air pollution problem.

But last month, Congress invoked the Congressional Review Act to repeal waivers granted by the Biden administration. The state in its lawsuit called this an unlawful action by Congress.

John Dunlap III, who served as California Air Resources Board chair under Gov. Pete Wilson in the 1990s, said in an interview with CalMatters that the Newsom administration “pushed too fast, and I think there were some holes” in their zero-emission car and truck rules.

Dunlap said by moving forward despite concerns about inadequate charging infrastructure, cost and the impacts on trucking, California regulators sent their critics straight into the arms of a more sympathetic federal government.

“They've been all in on zero-emission technology, which is great. It's been a priority. But, they haven't really cared to dialogue much, if at all, with the users of technology, particularly truck fleets,” he said. Dunlap was chair in 1996 when the board repealed deadlines requiring sales of electric cars because the technology wasn’t ready.

Under the landmark rule adopted by the air board in 2022, all new cars sold in California would have to be zero emissions beginning with 2035 models, ramping up from 68% in 2030. For trucks, California enacted two rules, one in 2020 and then one in 2023 that would phase out new diesel trucks by 2042. None will now be implemented.

Automakers say the rules were too aggressive and would have led to manufacturing job losses, higher car prices and limited consumer choices.

“The auto industry has invested billions in electrification and has 144 electrified models on the market right now. Again, the concerns were about the mandate – not the technology,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in a statement.

Conservatives say the air board is an unelected board that wields too much power. (Its members include appointees from Newsom and the Legislature, and local elected officials.) A Democrat in the Legislature last month urged Randolph, the board’s chair, to resign because the agency hasn’t analyzed the economic costs of its rules.

One new clean-air rule, the revamped Low Carbon Fuel Standard implemented last week, was met with widespread, vehement criticism from elected officials and industry since it will raise the price of gasoline by an unknown amount.

Amid concerns about the costs to consumers, the Trump administration and industry groups also are making it difficult for local agencies to take bold action.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District — responsible for regulating industrial plants and products that pollute the LA basin’s air — recently rejected rules phasing in zero-emission water heaters and furnaces.

The rules would have brought one of the biggest pollution reductions that the district has implemented in decades. But business groups and others were strongly opposed, saying fees imposed on manufacturers would raise the cost of products. And U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli threatened the local air district with a lawsuit if it approved the rule.

South Coast district Board Chair Vanessa Delgado and Executive Officer Wayne Nastri rejected multiple requests for interviews with CalMatters about what they plan to do next to clean the air in the LA basin.

“As you know, 80% of emissions in our region come from mobile sources — planes, trains, ships, heavy-duty trucks — all of which we do not have federal regulatory authority over,” said Nahal Mogharabi, spokesperson for the agency.

She directed all questions to Trump’s EPA.

What else can the state do?

Last month at the clean-vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Brett Ivy, a fleet manager for the aerospace company Northrop Grumman, wandered through Angel Stadium’s parking lot, looking at electric trucks and machines that he could potentially buy for his company.

Ivy knows the state isn’t enforcing its truck mandates, so he doesn’t know what his bosses will direct him to do in the future. He said they could abandon electric vehicles altogether.

But Ivy added, who knows what the next administration would bring, and Northrop Grumman has to think long-term. He wants to be prepared to do his job managing the company’s fleet of trucks.

“If we don’t, a new administration might reverse what (Trump) did,” he said. “Then you’re behind.”

The trucking industry, when the mandate was approved in 2023, predicted economic chaos and dysfunction and that it would “fail pretty spectacularly.” With its repeal, Nick Chiappe of the California Trucking Association expects that fleet owners will keep buying hydrogen and electric trucks when it makes economic sense, such as with smaller vehicles with shorter hauls.

“The industry will continue to work with (the air board) on reasonable steps to advance zero-emissions technology but maintain that the programs being rolled back were infeasible from the moment they were proposed,” Chiappe said.

Experts and advocates say California will have to approach clean air policy from many angles — mandates and incentives.

“There is still work that can be done,” said Martinez of Earthjustice. It’ll require “being creative and not losing steam,” he said. “These are big hits (from Trump) but I think still continuing to press on zero-emission vehicles is going to be really critical.”

Craig Segall, a former deputy executive officer for the state Air Resources Board, said the state should set new standards for cars and trucks. “The only thing that EPA is barred from doing is issuing substantially the same – not similar – waivers in the future,” he said. “The state can actually do quite a lot in terms of new standards.”

Segall said the state also should support companies that have already been buying zero-emission trucks with financing programs and get at the root of the transportation problem by expanding mass transit.

“There's a wide array of things that the state could do to make it clear that they don't wish to continue having gasoline cars sold in the state of California.” MARY NICHOLS, FORMER CHAIR OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARDOffering incentives to consumers buying clean cars and trucks will be key. But Grundler, when asked whether California has the funds for more incentive programs, answered bluntly: No.

The state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, paid for by its cap and trade market program, typically has around $4 billion for programs related to climate change and air pollution. But because of the large deficit this year, the new budget allocated about $1.5 billion of those cap and trade funds to Cal Fire for fire prevention. It’s unclear how much will be left over for other projects.

In the state’s new budget, $132 million is allocated over the next fiscal year for an air board program offering incentives to truck fleet buyers.There also are creative ways that the state can encourage the purchase of electric cars, said Mary Nichols, the longtime chair of the air board under two previous governors and Newsom. Registration fees or sales taxes could be based on whether a car is gas-powered or electric, she said.

“The state of California has authority over everything relating to what cars can operate on our roads, as long as we're not violating any constitutional requirements that deal with commerce between the states,” Nichols told CalMatters. “There's a wide array of things that the state could do to make it clear that they don't wish to continue having gasoline cars sold in the state of California.”

Tackling 'pollution magnets'

Experts say one of the most impactful policies the state could pursue without federal intervention could be regulating “pollution magnets.” These are hotspots, such as warehouses, ports and airports, that don’t directly pollute, but draw high-polluting vehicles, like diesel trucks and trains into communities.

Polluting ports, airports and warehouses “should be held responsible for the air pollution that's released into these neighborhoods because of their operations.”BRENNON MENDEZ, UCLA SCHOOL OF LAWThe South Coast Air Quality Management District is developing a rule that would push the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports to install more charging stations for zero-emission trucks and cargo handling equipment. The district also approved a rule for warehouses that environmentalists call a success. These are known as “indirect source rules” since they regulate a place that is a hotspot.

These types of regulations ""are definitely a leading strategy that California can continue to pursue environmental justice goals, despite the federal government being completely disinterested in environmental justice,” said Brennon Mendez, an environmental law and policy fellow at UCLA School of Law.

Polluting ports, airports and warehouses “should be held responsible for the air pollution that's released into these neighborhoods because of their operations,"" he said.

But while local air districts’ power to enact indirect source rules is well-established, the state’s power to do the same isn’t as clear.

A bill in the Legislature that enshrines the state’s power is opposed by labor and industry groups, especially now that the ports are facing economic uncertainty because of Trump’s tariffs. Assemblymember Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Rancho Cucamonga, said action on the bill is delayed until next year.

Also, a Senate bill would limit the South Coast district’s power to regulate the LA and Long Beach ports, requiring the agency to consider the costs and how ports and their tenants would be reimbursed, as well as the energy use and impacts on workers.

Randolph said it’s always been a struggle for California to slash enough emissions in California to achieve health standards, but now Trump’s actions “make the challenge even steeper and even harder.”

“The fundamental question,” she said, is “how do we continue to make progress…in the short-term and the long-term?”

“By rapidly sunsetting demand incentives, Congress is pulling the rug out from under manufacturers, disrupting the reshoring process that is well underway, and conceding the market to China in one year, when the runway of the domestic content incentive ends.” Mike Carr, executive director, Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition

“By voting for this bill, Congress chose to raise energy prices, put at risk thousands of energy projects already under development, destabilize investor confidence in energy markets, and put hundreds of thousands of American jobs at risk. This bill rewrites long-standing tax policy and layers on immediate, punitive sourcing requirements.” Jeff Cramer, president and chief executive officer, Coalition for Community Solar Access

“Even without support from the federal government, state leaders must take steps to ensure we keep the lights on and manage costs. With the right policy direction, governors, legislators, and regulators can take the lead on removing the barriers to building a better electric grid, and lowering costs to build and operate advanced energy. To unlock new development, policymakers can make it easier and more financially enticing for consumers to switch to more resilient energy solutions at their homes and businesses, they can speed up timelines for new energy infrastructure projects by fixing antiquated siting and permitting rules, and they can put more technology solutions to work with much needed changes to energy market regulations.” Heather O’Neill, chief executive officer, Advanced Energy United

“This Trump energy tax will cost electricity customers billions of dollars in higher bills. And costs for things like cleaner cars, solar energy and efficient air conditioners will skyrocket.

We’re already driving more than $300 billion in private investment, delivering reliable power, and creating jobs in every region of the country. Stable tax policies would have allowed us to do even more.” Ray Long, chief executive officer, American Council on Renewable Energy

“America’s electricity demand is projected to surge by as much as 50% by 2040.

It was almost exactly a year ago that the clean energy industry started to grapple seriously with a possible repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Candidate Trump had spent a year on the campaign trail talking about killing the “Green New Scam.” But after President Biden’s disastrous debate performance, the reality of the tight race set in. Suddenly, everyone started gaming out the possibility of IRA repeal — while also hoping the benefits to red districts would insulate the industry from radical change in a tax and spending bill.

That anxiety peaked on July 1 when the Senate unveiled its sweeping budget bill, delivering a significant rollback of federal clean energy incentives that have fueled a surge in new projects and private investment in the last three years.

As the industry now grapples with its new reality, it’s leaning into economic messaging focused on job loss, American competitiveness, and grid reliability. There’s also a widespread acknowledgement that the outcome could have been much worse, and some optimism that the massive near-term energy demands of artificial intelligence will still boost clean energy sources to the top of the market.

Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement on Thursday that the bill was a “step backward” for American energy policy that will limit economic growth. “The combination of surging demand for electric power and economic benefits of renewable energy technologies ensure that clean power will continue to play a significant and growing role in our nation’s energy mix,” he added. “It is time for the brawlers to get out of the way and let the builders get back to work.”

Jobs

Job losses were a central theme to industry lobbying and reactions to the legislation. Even Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and former “first buddy,” expressed alarm over the bill’s potential to “destroy millions of jobs in America.”

The fact that many of those jobs were set to be created or destroyed in Republican-led districts didn’t ultimately sway lawmakers.

Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, focused on existing jobs in energy manufacturing that stand to be destroyed: “Many of these brand new factories will be forced to shut down and lay off thousands of workers, gutting communities that were finally seeing the kind of industrial revival rural America needs.”

In a statement before the House passed its final version, the North American Building Trades Union, which represents 3 million construction workers, called the bill “the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.” The union pointed to the potential loss of 1.75 million construction jobs, around $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits — “the equivalent of terminating over 1,000 Keystone XL projects.”

The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers also lamented the loss of “hundreds of thousands of good-paying construction jobs, billions of hours, and hundreds of billions in lost wages and economic benefits to America’s middle class.” The bill is a move to “abandon critical investment in American infrastructure and the energy independence they have been tripping over themselves to take credit for the last few years,” president Kennth W. Cooper said.

American competitiveness

Another key focus was China, and whether America is ceding global dominance in modern energy.

Nonprofit advocacy organization Ceres said the bill is a “significant setback” to the country’s energy, economic, and industrial goals. “By raising taxes on energy producers and users, this legislation puts the U.S. at severe risk of ceding its leadership in the 21st century’s most important industries to China and other countries,” the group’s head of federal policy said in a statement.

The Coalition for Community Solar Access pointed to the 150 GW of new load projected to hit the U.S. grid from advanced manufacturing and AI in the next five years. While the bill kneecaps the cheapest and fastest-to-deploy resources, China deployed 277 gigawatts of solar last year, CCSA said.

The American Council on Renewable Energy called the bill a “missed opportunity” to get ahead of China in clean energy and AI. “China is aggressively investing in clean energy and digital infrastructure because they understand that energy security and economic competitiveness go hand in hand,” president Ray Long said in a statement. “This bill should have matched that urgency.”

Grid reliability

The industry is also warning about the bill’s potential to decrease grid reliability by restricting energy production during a historic demand surge.

Advanced Energy United’s president and CEO Heather O’Neill put it this way: “America didn’t have an energy emergency before, but this legislation goes a long way towards creating one.”

The Federation of American Scientists said Monday that the bill will do the exact opposite of what the U.S. grid needs, and increase energy bills, including for consumers and states that aren’t using clean energy. “Do you want more energy on the grid faster? To provide reliable power to your homes during storms or to support the buildout of AI data centers?” FAS wrote. Clean energy investment and production tax credits made that possible, helping to cover up front costs of building zero-emission energy and thereby lowering consumer energy bills and increasing grid reliability by getting more energy online quicker.

Nonprofit advocacy organization Americans for a Clean Energy Grid took a look-ahead approach, urging lawmakers on both sides of the aisle “to come together now on pragmatic, durable solutions to upgrade and build out the electric grid.” Permitting reform should be a key focus in the next few weeks and months, executive director Christina Hayes said in a statement. “No matter your politics, the reality is clear: demand for electricity is rising,” Hayes said. “Whether that power comes from natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind, or solar, none of it will reach homes, businesses, or data centers without a modern, reliable, and expanded transmission network.”

Worse outcomes were avoided

The final bill signed by President Trump on July 4th removed provisions that would have changed tax policy retroactively, as well as the surprise excise tax on wind and solar. Avoiding those disastrous outcomes was considered a win for the industry.

Lisa Jacobson, President of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, said the Senate provided a “more workable transition” for some energy businesses but warned that remaining provisions “could still cause uncertainty and increase energy costs.”

Nathaniel Keohane, who leads the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions pointed to another potential bright spot: “The Senate bill would preserve tax credits for newer technologies like advanced nuclear, battery storage, geothermal energy, and carbon capture, as well as advanced manufacturing,” he said in a statement early last week after the Senate passed its bill. “That progress is significant.”

Crux, a clean energy financing marketplace, said that the preservation of tax credit transferability “reflects growing bipartisan recognition that this mechanism is essential to financing America’s energy future.” The interconnected nature of clean energy financing, Crux said, “means that tax credit policy changes make debt capital and other types of financing even more critical for project success.”

While many in the industry tried to balance criticism with bipartisanship, there was plenty of bluntness, too: “It’s hard to think of a bigger self-own,” Princeton’s Jesse Jenkins told The Atlantic. “We’re effectively raising taxes on the country’s main sources of power at a time when electricity prices are already rising.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-18-1024x683.png,N,,2025-07-07 16:23:03.077568

1 substantially changes the value of the 45Z credit by eliminating the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF.","President Donald Trump on July 4 signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The budget reconciliation package extends and updates the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and revives a tax credit benefiting small biodiesel producers but repeals several other bioenergy-related tax incentives.

The bill, H.R. 1, has undergone numerous changes since it was first introduced in May, including those related to the extension and administration of 45Z.

The original 45Z tax credit, as established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provided a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The version of H.R. 1 originally passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22 aimed to extend the 45Z credit for four additional years, through the end of 2031. The initial draft bill released by the Senate Finance Committee on June 16 also included a four-year extension. The Senate bill, however, was later amended to include only a two-year extension, through the end of 2029. The legislation signed by Trump enacts that two-year extension. The 45Z credit is now in place through the end of 2029.

The enacted version of H.R. 1 substantially changes the value of the 45Z credit by eliminating the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF. The change essentially caps the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all eligible fuels, including SAF.

H.R. 1 also limits 45Z eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. The Senate had previously proposed to place no geographical limits on feedstock eligibility but would have reduced the value of the credit by 20% for non-U.S. feedstocks. The language on feedstock eligibility was updated prior to Senate passage of the bill.

Other changes to the 45Z credit implemented by H.R. 1 include provisions that specify that the emissions rate for eligible transportation fuel under 45Z may not be less than zero; eliminate indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of eligible fuel; direct the U.S. Treasury Department to establish distinct emissions rates for specific manure feedstocks, including dairy manure, swine manure and poultry manure; and restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities. H.R. 1 retains full transferability of the 45Z credit.

H.R. 1 also includes provisions to support small-scale biodiesel producers by updating and extending the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit. That credit, which expired at the end of 2024, provided a 10-cent-per-gallon credit on the first 15 million gallons of agri-biodiesel produced annually by small producers, defined to include facilities with a capacity of less than 60 MMgy. H.R. 1 extends the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit through the end of 2026 and boosts the value to 20 cents per gallon. Language included in the bill specifies that the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit can be stacked with the 45Z credit, allowing eligible producers to simultaneously claim both credits for each gallon of eligible fuel.

The legislation provides additional support for biofuel producers by extending mandatory funding under the USDA’s Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels through fiscal year 2031. That program provides payments to eligible producers to expand the production of advanced biofuels.

H.R. 1 leaves the 45Q credit for carbon sequestration largely intact, but repeal various other bioenergy-related tax credits, including the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, which supports retail availability of E85, B20, and renewable natural gas (RNG); the clean hydrogen production tax credit; and the energy efficient home improvement credit, which, in part, supports the installation of residential wood heating appliances.

Also related to biofuels, H.R. 1 rescinds unobligated funding allocated to the U.S. EPA by the IRA to support certain functions related to the Renewable Fuel Standard. The impacted funding includes $5 million allocated to the EPA to support the development and establishment of tests and protocols regarding the environment and public health effects of a fuel or fuel additive; perform internal and extramural data collection and analyses to regularly update applicable regulations, guidance, and procedures for determining lifecycle GHG emission of a fuel; and review, analyze and evaluate the impacts of all transportation fuels, including fuel lifecycle implications, on the general public and on low-income and disadvantaged communities and $10 million to the EPA to fund “new grants to industry and other related activities…to support investments in advanced biofuels.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America welcomed the extension of the 45Z and Amall Agri-Biodiesel Producer tax credits. “Clean Fuels thanks Congress for working overtime to provide certainty for biodiesel and renewable diesel producers – especially small companies – so they can resume production and industry growth. Clean Fuels especially thanks Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for securing an enhancement to the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit to help small producers as they make the transition to the §45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit,"" said Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels' vice president of federal affairs. ""While the extension of the §45Z credit with transferability through 2029 provides some immediate stability, our industry continues to urge Treasury to promptly propose and finalize clear, reliable rules for the credit.”

The Iowa Biodiesel Board applauded revival of the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit. “We commend President Trump for recognizing the critical role biodiesel can play in building next-generation energy infrastructure and driving a new industrial revolution rooted in American innovation,” said Grant Kimberley, executive director of the IBB. “ This extension sends a clear signal of stability to the marketplace and reinforces our nation’s commitment to strengthening domestic energy capacity.

“The revival of the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit through 2026—and increasing it to 20 cents-per-gallon—is a vital lifeline to small independent producers like those in Iowa. We thank Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for championing the inclusion of that provision,” he added.

“The ability for producers to transfer the credit, the appropriate prioritization of North American feedstocks, and the removal of arbitrary indirect land use change penalties all bode well for Iowa’s biodiesel industry and soybean farmers,” Kimberley continued. For producers who have been idled or running at reduced capacity since the start of the year, this is a breath of relief and welcome signal for a bright future.”

Ethanol producer POET thanked Trump for securing the 45Z extension. “President Trump continues to reassert his support for American farmers and energy independence,” said Joshua Shields, POET’s senior vice president of corporate affairs. “With this extension signed into law, 45Z is now best positioned to transform U.S. agriculture, providing new markets for farmers and furthering biofuel energy dominance. POET thanks both President Trump and our biofuel champions in Congress for their hard-fought efforts to get this provision across the finish line.”

The American Biogas Council applauded the biogas provisions of H.R. 1. “The Act contains several helpful provisions for the biogas sector, acknowledging the enormous potential of recycling decomposable waste – from farms, food systems, and wastewater treatment plants – to produce reliable American-made energy that both generates electricity and fuels the transportation sector,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC.

“With the preservation of key incentives, including continued support for clean fuel production and power generation credits, this bill helps provide certainty for developers to plan, invest, and grow,” Serfass continued. “We are particularly encouraged by provisions that ensure American producers using U.S. and North American feedstocks can compete on a level playing field, while also maintaining appropriate values for manure-based biogas.

The Renewable Fuels Association said H.R. 1 will enhance the role of the U.S. ethanol industry in contributing to American energy security and innovation. “From the very beginning of the budget reconciliation process, our goal was to advocate for the inclusion of tax policies that provide certainty, growth opportunities, and market stability for U.S. ethanol producers. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed today accomplishes that objective. We thank the many renewable fuel supporters in Congress and President Trump for ensuring American ethanol producers and farmers had a voice and seat at the table in this process,” said Geoff Cooper, RFA president and CEO. “The extension and modifications to the 45Z clean fuel production credit, reinstatement of the Research and Development immediate expensing provisions, and improvement of the 45Q carbon sequestration and utilization credit will provide a growth-oriented tax policy climate that ethanol producers can count on, improving the role that renewable fuels can play in helping reach our nation’s energy independence goals.”

The American Coalition for Ethanol praised H.R. 1’s 45Z provisions. “We’re grateful to our Congressional champions for their steadfast leadership to support and strengthen the 45Z credit, which is remarkable considering the fact most other IRA-era tax credits were limited or phased-out in the final package.,” said Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE. “While there were other improvements we had hoped to achieve in the final 45Z language, restoring transferability of the credit, removing indirect land use change (ILUC) penalties, and restricting feedstock eligibility to USMCA countries will strengthen the credit from its original version.”

“In terms of the credit term, we preferred the House language which would have extended 45Z through 2031, and we also urged Congress to specifically allow low-carbon farming practices to be monetized through 45Z with the feedstock calculator and guidelines USDA has released, but nevertheless ACE remains committed to working with federal agencies to implement the credit in ways that reward on-farm conservation practices and accelerate the use of homegrown, low-carbon biofuels,” Jennings continued.

The RNG Coalition indicated the 45Z extension is vital to the sustained growth of renewable natural gas (RNG) in the U.S. “The credit will play a critical role in directing investment toward low-carbon fuels, based on lifecycle emissions performance,” said Geoff Dietz, senior director of federal government affairs at the RNG Coalition. “We look forward to working with the Department of Treasury on the implementation of several key Section 45Z provisions and would strongly encourage the agency to initiate that process soon. Clear, pragmatic, and expedient regulation will be critical to ensure that Section 45Z reflects the Congressional intent to accelerate sustainable development, deployment, and utilization of renewable gas. RNG is a vital tool to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, bolster energy security, reliability and affordability, and provide key benefits to diverse American communities — from farm communities in South Dakota to Staten Island in New York City where the first RNG project was sited over forty years ago.""

Growth Energy also applauded the 45Z extension. “The president wants to go big on American energy dominance, and this legislation delivers,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “An extension of 45Z will unlock billions of dollars in new investments across rural America supporting strong, stable markets for America’s farmers and positioning American biofuel producers to compete in global fuel markets. We applaud our champions in the House and Senate, who fought hard to ensure that U.S. biofuel producers are positioned to deliver more clean energy, hold down fuel costs, and restore industrial might across the heartland.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Trump_One_Big_Bill_634e504957.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 16:25:56.882395

H.R. 1, President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” was signed into law on July 4, 2025. The sweeping legislation proposes to end a number of climate-focused funding programs and emissions regulations. The bill affects nearly every sector of the economy, but it hits heavy-duty trucks — both electric and diesel-powered — especially hard.

For fleet managers managers, this bill sends a clear message. The federal government is stepping back from its clean truck investment strategy.

The Big Beautiful Bill Puts EV Tax Credits on the Chopping Block

One of the most immediate impacts of H.R. 1 is the proposed repeal of the Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit under Section 45W of the Internal Revenue Code. Fleets have used this credit, which provides up to $40,000 per vehicle for eligible commercial electric trucks, to offset the high cost of electrification. The bill terminates this credit outright. Section 112003 cuts off a major financial incentive for adopting battery-electric Class 6–8 trucks.

The section states:

IN GENERAL. — No credit shall be determined under this section with respect to any vehicle acquired after December 31, 2025.

(2) EXCEPTION FOR BINDING CONTRACTS. — Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to vehicles placed in service before January 1, 2033, and acquired pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before May 12, 2025.

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE. — The amendment made by this section shall apply to vehicles acquired after December 31, 2025.

The bill also proposes to eliminate the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (Section 112004), which helps subsidize the cost of EV charging infrastructure.

IN GENERAL. — Section 30C(i) is amended by striking ‘‘December 31, 2032’’ and inserting ‘‘December

31, 2025’’.

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE. — The amendment made by this section shall apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2025.

SAN DIEGO, Calif. (July 7, 2025) – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has entered into a settlement agreement with Gateway Energy Storage, LLC to direct cleanup in the wake of a lithium-ion battery fire that occurred at the company’s energy storage facility in San Diego.

“Calling a technology ‘green energy’ does not mean there are no environmental impacts. This is an issue of growing concern,” said EPA Pacific Southwest Region Administrator Josh F.W. Cook. “I am alarmed by the incidents and impacts of utility grade battery fires on first responders, specifically the professional firefighters who are exposed to horrible toxic conditions when batteries catch fire. This settlement action is a step in the right direction, but the broader battery storage fire issue requires additional attention and EPA enforcement.”

On May 15, 2024 a fire broke out at the Gateway Energy Storage facility, with periodic flare-ups until May 28. The facility contained approximately 14,796 nickel-manganese-cobalt lithium-ion batteries. EPA is working in coordination with local fire authorities and the County of San Diego to oversee the cleanup effort undertaken by the responsible party.

Fire damaged batteries pose ongoing risks of fire, explosion, and chemical releases. In the agreement being announced today, EPA is requiring comprehensive safety measures and monitoring to protect nearby residents and workers during the cleanup process.

Under the settlement agreement, Gateway Energy Storage must conduct environmental monitoring during all battery handling operations; safely remove, package, and dispose of all impacted battery packs; and submit detailed work plans and progress reports to EPA.

Background

Gateway Energy Storage, LLC operates the facility as a Delaware-incorporated limited liability company. The company is considered a responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and must bear the costs of the cleanup.

The root cause of the fire remains under investigation. EPA and local agencies will continue to oversee cleanup activities until all work is completed and the site no longer poses a threat to public health or the environment.

After nearly a decade of limited development, the strategy outlines over 40 bold actions to reignite onshore wind deployment across the UK, aiming to deliver up to 29 GW of clean, homegrown power by 2030.

The strategy ends a de facto nine-year ban in England, unlocking the potential for thousands of new wind turbines and repowering older ones. Key measures include:

Unlocking up to 10 GW of new capacity by resolving conflicts with aerospace and defence infrastructure.

Repowering ageing turbines to maintain and enhance the UK’s existing wind fleet.

Streamlining planning processes with updated data, faster assessments, and better tools for developers and local authorities.

Expanding the Clean Industry Bonus, encouraging investment in UK-based supply chains and industrial regions.

The strategy could more than double the current onshore wind workforce, supporting up to 45,000 skilled jobs in engineering, construction, and maintenance by 2030. With over £40 billion in private clean energy investment already announced since July, the UK is positioning itself as a global leader in renewable energy.

Michael Shanks, Energy Minister, commented:

“Rolling out more onshore wind is a no-brainer – it’s one of our cheapest technologies, quick to build, supports thousands of skilled jobs and can provide clean energy directly to the communities hosting it.

“After years of decline, we’re giving industry the tools to get building again, backing industrial renewal and secure, clean, homegrown energy through our Plan for Change.”

Communities will also benefit directly. Updated guidance will offer £5,000 per megawatt per year for local initiatives, from new sports facilities to energy bill discounts. If the government hits its upper target of 29 GW, this could unlock £70 million annually for rural towns and villages.

In parallel, the government has completed a Marine Spatial Prioritisation Programme to de-risk offshore wind development. This will guide The Crown Estate’s Marine Delivery Routemap, ensuring sustainable use of the seabed while protecting marine ecosystems and supporting fisheries.

Onshore wind is one of the cheapest and fastest forms of renewable energy to deploy. By scaling up this technology, the UK aims to reduce reliance on volatile global gas markets, cut household energy bills, and secure a cleaner, more resilient energy future.

Contributing Writer

(Veritenews.org) — As thousands of architects and planners flocked to New Orleans in 2014 for the world’s largest sustainable design conference, the city saw a chance to prove it belonged in the green building big leagues.

City leaders announced at the Greenbuild International Conference and Expo that New Orleans would join Minneapolis, Seattle and a vanguard of other cities in developing a program requiring large building owners to track and disclose their energy use.

New Orleans’ embrace of “energy benchmarking” drew praise at the conference, with one green building expert declaring that the city was “paving the way” for the rest of the country to follow.

More than a decade later, New Orleans still hasn’t passed its energy benchmarking ordinance, falling behind about 50 other cities that now have energy tracking and disclosure requirements for most large buildings.

City leaders recently dusted off the proposed ordinance and expressed hope that they can get it passed this month.

“The benchmarking ordinance – finally!” City Council Vice President Helena Moreno said at a June 16 meeting unveiling the revamped proposal. “After many, many years, we’re finally getting there.”

The council is tentatively scheduled to consider approving the ordinance on July 10.

Data-driven and dollar-savvy

Benchmarking can both shame the power hogs and extol the virtues of the frugal. The data spurs investment in older, inefficient buildings and encourages more climate-conscious design in new ones, advocates say.

“It’s well understood that one cannot change what one does not measure,” said Christopher Johnson, a board member with the New Orleans chapter of the American Institute of Architects. By passing the ordinance, the city would be “empowering owners to take matters into their own hands to improve their buildings.”

Buildings are responsible for 40 percent of total energy use in the U.S., and about 35 percent of the country’s carbon emissions, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Compared to much of the country, buildings in New Orleans tend to be older and less energy-efficient, with high air conditioning use and little insulation.

Under the city’s plan, owners of buildings 50,000 square feet and larger would need to report annual energy use starting in 2026. In 2027, the requirement would expand to buildings more than 20,000 square feet. Noncompliance could result in fines between $1,000 and $3,000.

The fines aren’t for inefficiency, Council President JP Morrell said. “They’re for failing to report the data.”

Energy use would be tracked on an interactive map and published in an annual report.

The proposed ordinance covers about 1,500 properties. While buildings over 20,000 square feet make up just 1 percent of all structures, they account for nearly 40 percent of the city’s total building area, said Greg Nichols, the city’s deputy chief resilience officer.

Nearly 80 percent of the buildings covered under the ordinance are categorized as commercial, and about 20 percent are residential. Of the commercial buildings, a quarter are warehouses, 16 percent are hotels and 12 percent are offices.

Funding for implementing the ordinance is covered with $1.5 million from a $50 million greenhouse gas reduction grant awarded to the city by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year. Much of the money for the program would support a full-time employee tasked with promoting it and helping property owners with compliance.

While President Donald Trump has been canceling or reclaiming many climate-related grants awarded by former President Joe Biden’s administration, the EPA grant appears secure, Nichols said.

“Climate action is under threat right now from the Trump administration,” he said. “But this is an action that the City Council can take right now to show leadership at a time when other efforts are being imperiled.”

Power to compare

Benchmarking is a key component of the city’s climate action plan. Updated in 2022, the plan aims to cut the city’s greenhouse gas emissions in half before 2035 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The benchmarking ordinance was supposed to be passed by the end of last year, according to the plan.

“We are a city that’s committed to significant climate goals,” Morrell said. “It is nigh impossible to do that without benchmarking.”

Cities with similar ordinances have seen building energy use drop by an average of 2.4 percent annually, according to the EPA. At that rate, the agency calculates that a 500,000-square-foot office building can save about $120,000 per year.

Utility bill envy can be a potent motivator for property owners, Morrell said.

“It encourages a person to say, ‘Wait a second, we have similarly situated buildings, and I’m paying triple the cost in utility fees,’” he said. “‘It might be worth seeing how we can reduce those costs.’”

New Orleans can look to its city-owned buildings for further proof of benchmarking’s effectiveness. The city began tracking each building’s energy use more than a decade ago. Between 2018 and 2021, energy use fell by about 23 percent, Nichols said.

Most of the cities that require energy consumption tracking are concentrated in the Northeast, Midwest and West Coast. Austin, Atlanta, Orlando and Miami are the only Southern cities with benchmarking ordinances, according to the Institute for Market Transformation.

“I’d love (New Orleans) to be one of the leading cities in the South in this area,” Nichols said.

What’s the holdup?

Concerns about privacy and fines have hindered the ordinance’s progress, city leaders said. To ease those worries, the draft ordinance would disclose a building’s total energy use, not that of its tenants or other occupants. The ordinance would also waive penalties during the first year and cap fines at $3,000.

Councilmember Oliver Thomas expressed doubts about the ordinance, saying it may do little more than burnish New Orleans’ image. He cited the city’s recycling program, which diverts only about 2 percent of household waste from landfills – a rate that’s less than a tenth of the national average.

“We have to be more cautious because we keep producing investments and more money that comes from the public to create a lot of trendy things,” he said. “I don’t want to make the same mistakes we made with recycling and some other initiatives.”

Morrell called the comparison to recycling “inappropriate.” While recycling may be a costly solution for conserving some materials, benchmarking is a low-cost means of conserving both money and energy, he said.

“We’re showing that if you’re more energy efficient, you’ll see a direct reduction in costs,” said.

Energy jobs and reliability

Tracking the energy consumption of buildings can also spur economic growth, Nichols said. As property owners recognize the savings from energy upgrades, demand for the skilled workers who implement them will grow, he said.

Energy efficiency is projected to be Louisiana’s top clean energy job creator, with about 9,300 new roles for architects and heating, air conditioning and related tradespeople expected by 2030, according to a recent NREL report. The solar industry was expected to create up to 8,300 jobs, and wind energy would add nearly 600 positions during the same period.

“While solar and wind have huge potential, it’s actually energy efficiency that has the most job potential,” Nichols said. “And that’s because it includes a wide range of jobs, such as HVAC (technicians), electricians and insulation contractors.”

Benchmarking could also ease demand on the city’s outage-prone power grid, said Jesse George, the New Orleans policy director for the Alliance for Affordable Energy. A spike in power use during the sweltering Memorial Day weekend overwhelmed transmission lines and triggered rolling blackouts that cut the lights and AC for more than 100,000 households.

“That showed we need every possible tool in our toolbox to reduce our energy load and demand,” George said. “This ordinance, in terms of the cost to implement versus the potential benefit, is a no-brainer.”

The approval, finalized late last month and effective on Aug. 6, applies to a portion of Louisiana’s State Implementation Plan under the Clean Air Act’s “Good Neighbor” provision, which requires states to prevent their air emissions from causing nonattainment of federal air standards in downwind states.

“EPA determines that the Louisiana SIP contains adequate provisions to ensure that the air emissions in the state will not significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance” of the 2010 1-hour SO₂ National Ambient Air Quality Standard, the agency wrote in its final rule.

The EPA’s approval of Louisiana’s plan may also mark one of the final actions under the “Good Neighbor” policy. On March 12, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency would terminate the program as part of what he called “the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history.”

Zeldin argued that the program “expanded federal rules to more states and sectors beyond the program’s traditional focus” and led to widespread rejection of state-submitted air plans. It’s unclear how the rollback will affect already-approved SIPs, including Louisiana’s.

The decision is the result of a 12-year review process. Louisiana originally submitted its SIP revision in 2013 to address the interstate transport obligations tied to sulfur dioxide, a pollutant primarily emitted by industrial sources such as power plants and refineries.

The ruling drew praise from the Louisiana Public Service Commission, which submitted formal comments urging EPA to finalize the decision.

According to the ruling, the LPSC said the decision, “supports cooperative federalism, preserves the LPSC’s authority to regulate retail electric rates and services, and avoids the reliability and cost challenges associated with federal mandates.”

The EPA also received public comments in support of the rule from an anonymous commenter and a Louisiana resident. One citizen applauded the agency’s continued enforcement of the Clean Air Act and warned against rolling back interstate pollution protections.

The ruling does not include the actual comments.

Sulfur dioxide is a toxic gas linked to respiratory problems, especially in children and older adults. But the EPA concluded that Louisiana’s current emissions controls — while not specified in the rule — are sufficient to avoid causing pollution problems in neighboring states.

The action does not impose any new regulations beyond what the state already has on the books. In its response, EPA emphasized that its role is to approve state-submitted plans so long as they meet Clean Air Act standards, not to rewrite or add to them.

Environmental advocates may scrutinize the decision in light of Louisiana’s industrial footprint and ongoing air quality concerns in regions like Cancer Alley.

1 originally passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22 aimed to extend the 45Z credit for four additional years, through the end of 2031.
The 45Z credit is now in place through the end of 2029.
1 substantially changes the value of the 45Z credit by eliminating the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF.","President Donald Trump on July 4 signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The budget reconciliation package extends and updates the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and revives a tax credit benefiting small biodiesel producers but repeals several other bioenergy-related tax incentives.

The bill, H.R. 1, has undergone numerous changes since it was first introduced in May, including those related to the extension and administration of 45Z.

The original 45Z tax credit, as established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provided a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The version of H.R. 1 originally passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22 aimed to extend the 45Z credit for four additional years, through the end of 2031. The initial draft bill released by the Senate Finance Committee on June 16 also included a four-year extension. The Senate bill, however, was later amended to include only a two-year extension, through the end of 2029. The legislation signed by Trump enacts that two-year extension. The 45Z credit is now in place through the end of 2029.

The enacted version of H.R. 1 substantially changes the value of the 45Z credit by eliminating the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF. The change essentially caps the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all eligible fuels, including SAF.

H.R. 1 also limits 45Z eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. The Senate had previously proposed to place no geographical limits on feedstock eligibility but would have reduced the value of the credit by 20% for non-U.S. feedstocks. The language on feedstock eligibility was updated prior to Senate passage of the bill.

Other changes to the 45Z credit implemented by H.R. 1 include provisions that specify that the emissions rate for eligible transportation fuel under 45Z may not be less than zero; eliminate indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of eligible fuel; direct the U.S. Treasury Department to establish distinct emissions rates for specific manure feedstocks, including dairy manure, swine manure and poultry manure; and restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities. H.R. 1 retains full transferability of the 45Z credit.

H.R. 1 also includes provisions to support small-scale biodiesel producers by updating and extending the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit. That credit, which expired at the end of 2024, provided a 10-cent-per-gallon credit on the first 15 million gallons of agri-biodiesel produced annually by small producers, defined to include facilities with a capacity of less than 60 MMgy. H.R. 1 extends the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit through the end of 2026 and boosts the value to 20 cents per gallon. Language included in the bill specifies that the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit can be stacked with the 45Z credit, allowing eligible producers to simultaneously claim both credits for each gallon of eligible fuel.

The legislation provides additional support for biofuel producers by extending mandatory funding under the USDA’s Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels through fiscal year 2031. That program provides payments to eligible producers to expand the production of advanced biofuels.

H.R. 1 leaves the 45Q credit for carbon sequestration largely intact, but repeal various other bioenergy-related tax credits, including the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, which supports retail availability of E85, B20, and renewable natural gas (RNG); the clean hydrogen production tax credit; and the energy efficient home improvement credit, which, in part, supports the installation of residential wood heating appliances.

Also related to biofuels, H.R. 1 rescinds unobligated funding allocated to the U.S. EPA by the IRA to support certain functions related to the Renewable Fuel Standard. The impacted funding includes $5 million allocated to the EPA to support the development and establishment of tests and protocols regarding the environment and public health effects of a fuel or fuel additive; perform internal and extramural data collection and analyses to regularly update applicable regulations, guidance, and procedures for determining lifecycle GHG emission of a fuel; and review, analyze and evaluate the impacts of all transportation fuels, including fuel lifecycle implications, on the general public and on low-income and disadvantaged communities and $10 million to the EPA to fund “new grants to industry and other related activities…to support investments in advanced biofuels.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America welcomed the extension of the 45Z and Amall Agri-Biodiesel Producer tax credits. “Clean Fuels thanks Congress for working overtime to provide certainty for biodiesel and renewable diesel producers – especially small companies – so they can resume production and industry growth. Clean Fuels especially thanks Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for securing an enhancement to the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit to help small producers as they make the transition to the §45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit,"" said Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels' vice president of federal affairs. ""While the extension of the §45Z credit with transferability through 2029 provides some immediate stability, our industry continues to urge Treasury to promptly propose and finalize clear, reliable rules for the credit.”

The Iowa Biodiesel Board applauded revival of the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit. “We commend President Trump for recognizing the critical role biodiesel can play in building next-generation energy infrastructure and driving a new industrial revolution rooted in American innovation,” said Grant Kimberley, executive director of the IBB. “ This extension sends a clear signal of stability to the marketplace and reinforces our nation’s commitment to strengthening domestic energy capacity.

“The revival of the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit through 2026—and increasing it to 20 cents-per-gallon—is a vital lifeline to small independent producers like those in Iowa. We thank Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for championing the inclusion of that provision,” he added.

“The ability for producers to transfer the credit, the appropriate prioritization of North American feedstocks, and the removal of arbitrary indirect land use change penalties all bode well for Iowa’s biodiesel industry and soybean farmers,” Kimberley continued. For producers who have been idled or running at reduced capacity since the start of the year, this is a breath of relief and welcome signal for a bright future.”

Ethanol producer POET thanked Trump for securing the 45Z extension. “President Trump continues to reassert his support for American farmers and energy independence,” said Joshua Shields, POET’s senior vice president of corporate affairs. “With this extension signed into law, 45Z is now best positioned to transform U.S. agriculture, providing new markets for farmers and furthering biofuel energy dominance. POET thanks both President Trump and our biofuel champions in Congress for their hard-fought efforts to get this provision across the finish line.”

The American Biogas Council applauded the biogas provisions of H.R. 1. “The Act contains several helpful provisions for the biogas sector, acknowledging the enormous potential of recycling decomposable waste – from farms, food systems, and wastewater treatment plants – to produce reliable American-made energy that both generates electricity and fuels the transportation sector,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC.

“With the preservation of key incentives, including continued support for clean fuel production and power generation credits, this bill helps provide certainty for developers to plan, invest, and grow,” Serfass continued. “We are particularly encouraged by provisions that ensure American producers using U.S. and North American feedstocks can compete on a level playing field, while also maintaining appropriate values for manure-based biogas.

The Renewable Fuels Association said H.R. 1 will enhance the role of the U.S. ethanol industry in contributing to American energy security and innovation. “From the very beginning of the budget reconciliation process, our goal was to advocate for the inclusion of tax policies that provide certainty, growth opportunities, and market stability for U.S. ethanol producers. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed today accomplishes that objective. We thank the many renewable fuel supporters in Congress and President Trump for ensuring American ethanol producers and farmers had a voice and seat at the table in this process,” said Geoff Cooper, RFA president and CEO. “The extension and modifications to the 45Z clean fuel production credit, reinstatement of the Research and Development immediate expensing provisions, and improvement of the 45Q carbon sequestration and utilization credit will provide a growth-oriented tax policy climate that ethanol producers can count on, improving the role that renewable fuels can play in helping reach our nation’s energy independence goals.”

The American Coalition for Ethanol praised H.R. 1’s 45Z provisions. “We’re grateful to our Congressional champions for their steadfast leadership to support and strengthen the 45Z credit, which is remarkable considering the fact most other IRA-era tax credits were limited or phased-out in the final package.,” said Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE. “While there were other improvements we had hoped to achieve in the final 45Z language, restoring transferability of the credit, removing indirect land use change (ILUC) penalties, and restricting feedstock eligibility to USMCA countries will strengthen the credit from its original version.”

“In terms of the credit term, we preferred the House language which would have extended 45Z through 2031, and we also urged Congress to specifically allow low-carbon farming practices to be monetized through 45Z with the feedstock calculator and guidelines USDA has released, but nevertheless ACE remains committed to working with federal agencies to implement the credit in ways that reward on-farm conservation practices and accelerate the use of homegrown, low-carbon biofuels,” Jennings continued.

The RNG Coalition indicated the 45Z extension is vital to the sustained growth of renewable natural gas (RNG) in the U.S. “The credit will play a critical role in directing investment toward low-carbon fuels, based on lifecycle emissions performance,” said Geoff Dietz, senior director of federal government affairs at the RNG Coalition. “We look forward to working with the Department of Treasury on the implementation of several key Section 45Z provisions and would strongly encourage the agency to initiate that process soon. Clear, pragmatic, and expedient regulation will be critical to ensure that Section 45Z reflects the Congressional intent to accelerate sustainable development, deployment, and utilization of renewable gas. RNG is a vital tool to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, bolster energy security, reliability and affordability, and provide key benefits to diverse American communities — from farm communities in South Dakota to Staten Island in New York City where the first RNG project was sited over forty years ago.""

Growth Energy also applauded the 45Z extension. “The president wants to go big on American energy dominance, and this legislation delivers,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “An extension of 45Z will unlock billions of dollars in new investments across rural America supporting strong, stable markets for America’s farmers and positioning American biofuel producers to compete in global fuel markets. We applaud our champions in the House and Senate, who fought hard to ensure that U.S. biofuel producers are positioned to deliver more clean energy, hold down fuel costs, and restore industrial might across the heartland.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Trump_One_Big_Bill_634e504957.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 16:23:56.502034

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are a highly politicized topic at the moment. We are all witnessing how their history seems to be rhyming right now.

“History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.”

[Mark Twain]

California wants EVs to dominate by 2035. At that point, building EVs and batteries will be fundamental technologies for all the big manufacturing countries in the world. And California, as supposedly the fourth largest economy, does not want to be left out. Currently, however, Washington, DC still hangs on to the past.

By 2035—and certainly afterwards—fossil fuels will be too valuable and too expensive to compete with renewable energy. Which means consumers might pay dearly for the shortsighted political decisions of today. The U.S. of A. might be the one Western country missing out on all the advantages EVs can bring to cities and residents.

The biggest irony might be that the call to bring manufacturing back to America could be undermining a great manufacturing story that is happening right here in Silicon Valley.

But first, let’s go back and look at the long history of EVs.

Did Silicon Valley invent the Electric Car?

Unbeknownst to many these days, Silicon Valley did not invent electric vehicles, nor did GM or Nissan. This technology is actually much, much older than that. Some 120 years ago, the majority of motor vehicles were external combustion engines (steam-powered cars) fueled by coal, charcoal, wood, gasoline, or even kerosene. Internal combustion engines were still in the minority, and people regarded them as obnoxious, too noisy, and unsafe when using the hand crank system. Easier, safer, quicker and more convenient, electric cars, unfortunately, were also more expensive. It also took several days to recharge, but then again, it was much easier to swap out the empty battery pack with a full one.

Compared to ECEs and ICEs, EVs were the superior technology. Thomas Alva Edison thought so. So did the wife of Henry Ford. But then they completely disappeared. What happened?

The Jurassic Period

1828: Everything starts with Anyos Jedlik (Hungary) building the World’s first electric motor.

1832: Inventors like Robert Anderson and Robert Davidson (Scotland) were credited with being the first to electrify carriages and trains.

1834: Emily Davenport, Thomas Davenport, and Orange Smalley (Vermont) constructed one of the first American DC electric motors. The plan was to electrify streetcars.

1859: Another breakthrough technology was accomplished when French scientist Gaston Planté introduced the rechargeable lead-acid battery.

1881: With further advancements in battery technology, Gustave Trouvé (France) could show an electric tricycle at the International Electricity Exhibition.

1882: Thomas Parker (UK) improved on the lead-acid battery. His company, Electric Construction Corporation, had a virtual monopoly on the British electric car market in the 1890s.

1888: Andreas Flocken (Germany) is generally credited with building the World’s first real electric car. The Flocken Elektrowagen had a 0.7 kW motor and could reach 15 km/h using a 100 kg battery.

1891: William Morrison of Des Moines, Iowa, builds the first successful electric vehicle (EV) in the U.S.

1894: Andrew L. Riker, who owned an electric motor company in Brooklyn, built his first EV by putting two bicycles together and adding electric power.

1896: The first automobile race on a track in the US was won by a Riker.

1898: Andrew L. Riker founded the Riker Electric Vehicle Company, which later merged with the Electric Vehicle Company and mainly produced EV trucks.

1898: Ferdinand Porsche (Austria/Germany) first produced an electric vehicle, followed up with the world’s first hybrid vehicle (1900 Porsche Semper Vivus).

1899: Belgian Camille Jenatzy and his rocket-shaped electric car, La Jamais Contente, was the first vehicle to break the 100 km/h (62 mph) speed barrier.

1899-1915: Walter C. Baker starts and runs the Baker Electric Company. It became one of the premier producers of quality EVs. They produced several models, some of which advertised a range of over 200 miles.

1900: At that time, 40% of cars were steam-driven. Electric vehicles (often taxis or trucks) account for about one-third of all vehicles on the road. Gasoline combustion engines were loud, annoying, and regarded as dangerous. They were in the minority. Whereas EVs were regarded as reliable, luxurious and rather safe.

1901: Thomas A. Edison regards electric vehicles as superior and decides to aim for better batteries.

1902: Baker’s “Electric Torpedo” was unofficially the first car to break the 100 mph (160 km/h) land speed record. This might also have been the first car to feature seatbelts.

1906: Baker – the largest EV company in the world – builds 800 cars. Jay Leno likes to show off his Baker. It had a range of 60-80 miles, and it’s basically maintenance-free. Females loved the quiet ride.

1906: Wilhelm Maybach (Daimler, Germany) introduces an electric race car called Mercedes Mixte. It was however mainly used as a taxi.

1911: The electric self-starter invented by Charles Kettering (Delco) – on behalf of Henry M. Leland – makes gasoline-powered cars more convenient to use.

1912: Henry M. Leland orders 12,000 self-starters for his 1912 Cadillac models.

1912-17: GM produces an electric truck.

1914: Within the German Reich, there were almost 1,700 electric vehicles.

I bet there are a bunch of interesting stories behind each and every one of these points in time of the first 100 years of electric motors and electric vehicles. But eventually, we want to reach this century.

However, it’s worth noting that EVs were also driven by notable figures such as Thomas Alva Edison, Clara Ford, Helen Taft, Edith Bolling Wilson, and even King Chulalongkorn of Siam.

EVs almost succeeded

EVs were quite successful some 120 years ago. They were favored for city driving due to their quiet and clean operation compared to noisy and fuming gasoline cars. NYC had plenty of charging stations thanks to Thomas A. Edison. At times, there were 15,000 of these driving around New York City. Unfortunately, charging could take days, but battery packs were easier to swap. They were more expensive, more luxurious and the choice of the progressive upper class. And according to marketing of the time, no hand crank, no oil, no steam, no noise, no fumes, no odeur made them even “suitable” for upper class women.

So why did EVs disappear for almost 100 years?

The electric self-starter replaced the annoying and dangerous hand-crank, which removed the greatest inconvenience gasoline cars had. Electric vehicles (EVs) eventually lost out to Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) due to factors such as cost, performance, convenience, and infrastructure. Or just like today the shorter range, lack of chargers and long charging times were considered too inconvenient by many.

Within the bigger picture, DC was subsidizing the oil industry through tax incentives. This, in turn, benefited gasoline cars more than others. Combined with Henry Ford’s decision to deliver his Model T with an internal combustion engine, and turning that into the cheapest technology of the time, gave the gasoline car an edge. In 1912, an electric car cost approximately USD 1,750, while a petrol car cost USD 650. And while the government pushed the infrastructure for cheap ICEs, they never considered the long-term cost and effect of burning fossil fuels.

Conclusion

Fossil fuel subsidies and political decisions stopped progress in battery and drivetrain technology. This is now recognized as a major mistake of that time. This time around, Washington, DC, Houston and Detroit want to double down and repeat the same mistakes again. Last time around, America’s automobile industry benefited from politicians favoring oil. However, this time around, America’s car manufacturers will likely lose out, as Asia and Europe will continue to improve these technologies. America’s automobile industry might be in danger of becoming irrelevant. How quickly TESLA lost its technological edge by focusing on the Cybertruck instead of a Tesla Model 2 or their new Roadster was hard to watch.

It all depends on how DC and Detroit will treat Hybrids. But GM’s and Ford’s addiction to large trucks and SUVs isn’t helping in international markets. Losing out on the advantage of small cars running on cheap, renewable energy will hurt American consumers when oil prices rise. And now, Washington, D.C., wants to start incentivizing coal mining again. So, maybe, just maybe, the External Combustion Engine (ECE), as seen in steam cars and steam locomotives, is making a comeback soon.

Time’s almost up.

You’ve got until September 30, 2025 to claim up to $7,500 on a new electric vehicle, or $4,000 on a used one, before those federal tax credits vanish. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1) passed the Senate, got President Trump’s signature on July 4, and is now law. It slams the brakes on electric vehicle incentives that were originally scheduled to run through 2032.

This is a sharp turn from what the Inflation Reduction Act promised. That law allowed buyers to claim up to $7,500 on new electric vehicles priced under $55,000, or under $80,000 for trucks and SUVs. Used models qualified for up to $4,000 in credits. But now, both incentives are disappearing in less than 90 days. And if you’re thinking about waiting, that delay could cost you thousands. Here’s why smart buyers are acting fast.

Barclays analysts say buyers are likely to rush the market ahead of the cutoff, according to Reuters. Dealerships could get crowded quickly as consumers try to lock in savings.

In a recent policy brief, researchers Elaine Buckberg and Cassandra Cole wrote, “Eliminating the EV tax credits has the biggest single effect on EV sales.” The policy brief concluded with, “The single policy change with the largest effect is removing the EV tax credits, which would cut the EV share of new vehicle sales in 2030 by 6.0 percentage points (pp), from a Biden policy baseline of 48% to 42%.”

Additionally, ending the $5 billion NEVI program, which funds EV charging along highways, would lower the share of new EV sales by about 3.2 percentage points. Removing all support from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law would have a much bigger effect, cutting EV sales by 14.1 points. And in the most extreme scenario, scrapping every federal program and also taking away California’s ability to set stricter emissions rules, EVs could make up just 32 percent of new car sales by 2030.

Cutting these credits could shrink your choices, push prices higher, and slow tech development across the auto market.

So why the sudden cut? The new legislation rolls back a wide range of clean energy tax incentives. It cuts support for solar and wind, slashes EV subsidies, and eliminates future federal funding for related programs. Backers say the bill could cut $169 billion in federal spending over the next decade. Critics, especially environmental groups, say the savings come at the cost of cleaner air, modern infrastructure, and energy independence.

You are right in the middle of this moment.

Automakers such as Cadillac, Chevrolet, Kia, and Tesla are currently offering electric vehicles that still qualify for the federal tax credit. These models are made in the United States and meet the pricing requirements outlined by the program. According to Cox Automotive, the Tesla Model Y was the top-selling electric vehicle in the U.S. in 2024. It ranked just behind the Ford F-Series, Chevrolet Silverado, and Toyota RAV4 among all passenger vehicles. In short, people are buying these cars, and with good reason.

Here’s where things get even more practical. You do not have to depend on online listings or take a salesperson’s word for it. You can get behind the wheel and test these vehicles yourself before the federal tax credits expire by attending ride and drive events, like Electrify Expo.

Electrify Expo is coming to Redmond (just outside Seattle) on July 12 and 13, followed by Alameda near San Francisco on August 23 and 24. These events are nothing like traditional trade shows. Instead of just looking at vehicles, you’ll get to test drive hybrids (HEV), plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and fully electric (BEV) cars, try out e-bikes, and experience interactive demo zones firsthand.

You will be able to test models like the Lucid Gravity, Kia EV9, Lexus RX 450h+, Porsche Taycan, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Ford F-150 Lightning, Toyota Land Cruiser, Toyota Camry, and the Tesla Cybertruck. If you want to avoid long lines, consider grabbing a Power Pack Pass. It gives you early entry, shorter wait times, and quicker access to the vehicles. No standing around in the heat or waiting while others cut in line.

Barclays isn’t alone in predicting a sales rush. As the tax credit cutoff gets closer, dealers may sell out of qualifying models faster than usual. And there’s more at stake than just personal savings. U.S. automakers could dial back production. Imports could face new tariffs. California’s stricter emissions laws are now facing legal hurdles tied to this federal rollback.

And yes, it’s gotten political. President Trump recently wrote on Truth Social: “Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history. Without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa.” Whether you agree with him or not, that kind of messaging affects investor confidence and consumer behavior.

This is your final chance to combine federal and state incentives before they disappear.

So if you’re hoping to lock in a lower monthly payment or want access to the latest tech, now is a smart time to start looking. Head to Electrify Expo, where you can speak directly with brand representatives. Ask the questions that matter, like vehicle pricing, battery condition, and charging details. Take the time to find out what works best for your budget and your daily routine.

Also, check your state benefits. Rebates are still active in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, Texas, and Washington. In some cases, you can stack those with the federal credit. But only if you act before the federal window slams shut.

So yeah, the timing isn’t ideal. But the opportunity is real. And it’s still yours to grab.

“This president, this Congress, will not kill the electric car,” said Grundler, a deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources Board. “They won't kill the electric truck, and they certainly won't kill the California spirit.”

Despite that optimism, California officials — now reined in by the Trump administration and growing concerns about affordability and costs — are struggling to come up with new ways to clean up the nation’s most polluted air.

Lacking federal permission to set aggressive emission standards for the first time in almost 60 years, California may be left mainly with voluntary agreements with the auto, trucking and rail industries, and subsidies to entice consumers into buying electric vehicles.

Congress last month revoked the state’s authority to implement three landmark rules that ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and phase out diesel trucks. In addition, California was forced to abandon four other ambitious rules for zero-emission trucks, locomotives and commercial harbor craft because the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency would be unlikely to grant waivers.

Those seven mandates, now unenforceable, were key to cleaning up the pollutants that leave about 34 million Californians regularly breathing unhealthy air. In another blow to California’s efforts, Congress and President Donald Trump eliminated tax credits for consumers who buy electric cars.

At the same time, California’s air quality rules are facing growing pushback from the public, industry — and even some Democrats in the Legislature — because of the impacts on gas prices and other economic concerns.

Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, in an interview with CalMatters, did not offer any details on how the agency will make up for the voluminous tons of smog-causing gases and soot those rules would have eliminated.

“There's no one strategy that's going to work. It's really going to need to be a suite of different things,” Randolph said. The governor and Legislature will help decide “what strategies are going to be the most effective, the most cost effective, the most likely to be able to scale up,"" she said.

The air board is hosting four meetings in the coming weeks to hear ideas from industry groups, environmentalists and community members about how the state should now approach clean air regulation.

In an executive order last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom directed the air board to develop a new zero-emission car mandate — apparently in preparation for when the state either wins its lawsuit against Trump or when he leaves office.

Newsom also ordered the air board to develop a plan by Aug. 11 to keep expanding California’s market for electric cars and trucks. As part of the plan, the state agency must consider ways to improve charging infrastructure and offer incentives.

“We know that the federal government is going to be completely useless in our efforts to clean the air, despite rhetoric claiming they care about clean air. State and local governments are going to have to do more,” said Adrian Martinez, an attorney with the San Francisco-based environmental group Earthjustice.

“We just have to go it alone.”

Heart and lungs at stake

It’s been a long, bumpy road to cleaning up exhaust from California’s 36 million vehicles. Gas-powered cars and diesel trucks remain the state’s largest sources of smog and soot despite decades of cutting emissions.

Much of that pollution is inhaled by the most vulnerable Black and brown communities near ports, highways and warehouses. Ozone, a smog-causing gas, and fine particles of soot are linked to premature deaths from heart attacks and respiratory diseases, and increased emergency room visits.

For six decades, a provision in the Clean Air Act has granted California the power to set its own vehicle standards that are stricter than the federal government’s because of the state’s unique and severe air pollution problem.

But last month, Congress invoked the Congressional Review Act to repeal waivers granted by the Biden administration. The state in its lawsuit called this an unlawful action by Congress.

John Dunlap III, who served as California Air Resources Board chair under Gov. Pete Wilson in the 1990s, said in an interview with CalMatters that the Newsom administration “pushed too fast, and I think there were some holes” in their zero-emission car and truck rules.

Dunlap said by moving forward despite concerns about inadequate charging infrastructure, cost and the impacts on trucking, California regulators sent their critics straight into the arms of a more sympathetic federal government.

“They've been all in on zero-emission technology, which is great. It's been a priority. But, they haven't really cared to dialogue much, if at all, with the users of technology, particularly truck fleets,” he said. Dunlap was chair in 1996 when the board repealed deadlines requiring sales of electric cars because the technology wasn’t ready.

Under the landmark rule adopted by the air board in 2022, all new cars sold in California would have to be zero emissions beginning with 2035 models, ramping up from 68% in 2030. For trucks, California enacted two rules, one in 2020 and then one in 2023 that would phase out new diesel trucks by 2042. None will now be implemented.

Automakers say the rules were too aggressive and would have led to manufacturing job losses, higher car prices and limited consumer choices.

“The auto industry has invested billions in electrification and has 144 electrified models on the market right now. Again, the concerns were about the mandate – not the technology,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in a statement.

Conservatives say the air board is an unelected board that wields too much power. (Its members include appointees from Newsom and the Legislature, and local elected officials.) A Democrat in the Legislature last month urged Randolph, the board’s chair, to resign because the agency hasn’t analyzed the economic costs of its rules.

One new clean-air rule, the revamped Low Carbon Fuel Standard implemented last week, was met with widespread, vehement criticism from elected officials and industry since it will raise the price of gasoline by an unknown amount.

Amid concerns about the costs to consumers, the Trump administration and industry groups also are making it difficult for local agencies to take bold action.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District — responsible for regulating industrial plants and products that pollute the LA basin’s air — recently rejected rules phasing in zero-emission water heaters and furnaces.

The rules would have brought one of the biggest pollution reductions that the district has implemented in decades. But business groups and others were strongly opposed, saying fees imposed on manufacturers would raise the cost of products. And U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli threatened the local air district with a lawsuit if it approved the rule.

South Coast district Board Chair Vanessa Delgado and Executive Officer Wayne Nastri rejected multiple requests for interviews with CalMatters about what they plan to do next to clean the air in the LA basin.

“As you know, 80% of emissions in our region come from mobile sources — planes, trains, ships, heavy-duty trucks — all of which we do not have federal regulatory authority over,” said Nahal Mogharabi, spokesperson for the agency.

She directed all questions to Trump’s EPA.

What else can the state do?

Last month at the clean-vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Brett Ivy, a fleet manager for the aerospace company Northrop Grumman, wandered through Angel Stadium’s parking lot, looking at electric trucks and machines that he could potentially buy for his company.

Ivy knows the state isn’t enforcing its truck mandates, so he doesn’t know what his bosses will direct him to do in the future. He said they could abandon electric vehicles altogether.

But Ivy added, who knows what the next administration would bring, and Northrop Grumman has to think long-term. He wants to be prepared to do his job managing the company’s fleet of trucks.

“If we don’t, a new administration might reverse what (Trump) did,” he said. “Then you’re behind.”

The trucking industry, when the mandate was approved in 2023, predicted economic chaos and dysfunction and that it would “fail pretty spectacularly.” With its repeal, Nick Chiappe of the California Trucking Association expects that fleet owners will keep buying hydrogen and electric trucks when it makes economic sense, such as with smaller vehicles with shorter hauls.

“The industry will continue to work with (the air board) on reasonable steps to advance zero-emissions technology but maintain that the programs being rolled back were infeasible from the moment they were proposed,” Chiappe said.

Experts and advocates say California will have to approach clean air policy from many angles — mandates and incentives.

“There is still work that can be done,” said Martinez of Earthjustice. It’ll require “being creative and not losing steam,” he said. “These are big hits (from Trump) but I think still continuing to press on zero-emission vehicles is going to be really critical.”

Craig Segall, a former deputy executive officer for the state Air Resources Board, said the state should set new standards for cars and trucks. “The only thing that EPA is barred from doing is issuing substantially the same – not similar – waivers in the future,” he said. “The state can actually do quite a lot in terms of new standards.”

Segall said the state also should support companies that have already been buying zero-emission trucks with financing programs and get at the root of the transportation problem by expanding mass transit.

Offering incentives to consumers buying clean cars and trucks will be key. But Grundler, when asked whether California has the funds for more incentive programs, answered bluntly: No.

The state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, paid for by its cap and trade market program, typically has around $4 billion for programs related to climate change and air pollution. But because of the large deficit this year, the new budget allocated about $1.5 billion of those cap and trade funds to Cal Fire for fire prevention. It’s unclear how much will be left over for other projects.

In the state’s new budget, $132 million is allocated over the next fiscal year for an air board program offering incentives to truck fleet buyers.There also are creative ways that the state can encourage the purchase of electric cars, said Mary Nichols, the longtime chair of the air board under two previous governors and Newsom. Registration fees or sales taxes could be based on whether a car is gas-powered or electric, she said.

“The state of California has authority over everything relating to what cars can operate on our roads, as long as we're not violating any constitutional requirements that deal with commerce between the states,” Nichols told CalMatters. “There's a wide array of things that the state could do to make it clear that they don't wish to continue having gasoline cars sold in the state of California.”

Tackling 'pollution magnets'

Experts say one of the most impactful policies the state could pursue without federal intervention could be regulating “pollution magnets.” These are hotspots, such as warehouses, ports and airports, that don’t directly pollute, but draw high-polluting vehicles, like diesel trucks and trains into communities.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District is developing a rule that would push the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports to install more charging stations for zero-emission trucks and cargo handling equipment. The district also approved a rule for warehouses that environmentalists call a success. These are known as “indirect source rules” since they regulate a place that is a hotspot.

These types of regulations ""are definitely a leading strategy that California can continue to pursue environmental justice goals, despite the federal government being completely disinterested in environmental justice,” said Brennon Mendez, an environmental law and policy fellow at UCLA School of Law.

Polluting ports, airports and warehouses “should be held responsible for the air pollution that's released into these neighborhoods because of their operations,"" he said.

But while local air districts’ power to enact indirect source rules is well-established, the state’s power to do the same isn’t as clear.

A bill in the Legislature that enshrines the state’s power is opposed by labor and industry groups, especially now that the ports are facing economic uncertainty because of Trump’s tariffs. Assemblymember Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Rancho Cucamonga, said action on the bill is delayed until next year.

Also, a Senate bill would limit the South Coast district’s power to regulate the LA and Long Beach ports, requiring the agency to consider the costs and how ports and their tenants would be reimbursed, as well as the energy use and impacts on workers.

Randolph said it’s always been a struggle for California to slash enough emissions in California to achieve health standards, but now Trump’s actions “make the challenge even steeper and even harder.”

“The fundamental question,” she said, is “how do we continue to make progress…in the short-term and the long-term?”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70ef549/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2148x1128+0+97/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F87%2F00f078094192bfa33059c1bb739a%2Fscreenshot-2025-07-07-at-9-00-50-am.png,N,,2025-07-07 16:24:06.229998

On July 4, 2025, Congress passed, and President Trump signed, what’s being called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Catchy name aside, this legislation is packed with major changes that will affect your next car, your fuel bill, and maybe even your job. Whether you’re a mechanic, a car dealer, or someone simply trying to afford a reliable ride, this bill deserves your full attention. It dismantles a decade of EV favoritism, slashes penalties for automakers, and repositions gas-powered vehicles squarely back in the spotlight.

Let’s break it down – without the fluff – and explain exactly why this matters to you.

EVs at the curb: USPS forced to sell off thousands of electric trucks

This legislation starts by hitting reverse on the U.S. Postal Service’s electric vehicle program. That’s right – about 7,200 electric mail trucks, part of a multi-billion-dollar green fleet initiative were on the chopping block. The program is being scaled back and no longer funded. But in the meantime, the administration will refocus the Postal Service on delivering mail – not testing environmental policy.

This move reverses a $9.6 billion investment in further funding for electric vehicles. Ford’s custom-built E-Transit vans, developed specifically for the USPS, were at risk of being sold off, but the parliamentarian ruled that a 60% majority was required in order for this to happen. Finding buyers for a purpose-built fleet isn’t as easy as flipping used pickups. If no one wants them, the American taxpayer could be left footing the bill. This could become a future vote or be defunded later.

A hard reset on EPA overreach and fuel standards

Next up: the Environmental Protection Agency.

This bill takes direct aim at overreaching emissions mandates by eliminating California’s ability to set its own tougher vehicle emissions standards. California’s EPA waiver had long allowed the state to push automakers into building more EVs and hybrids – regardless of what the rest of the country wanted. That’s over. And with it, the ripple effect on nationwide vehicle standards could collapse.

More importantly, the bill removes the penalties automakers faced for missing fuel economy targets. Companies like Stellantis paid nearly $191 million in fines during just one two-year window (2019–2020) under CAFE standards. Now, those penalties are set to zero.

This gives automakers breathing room – and the ability to focus on building vehicles Americans actually want to buy: SUVs, trucks, and gas-powered cars with real utility or hybrid vehicles. Not battery-powered compliance boxes.

EV tax credits: Ending sooner than you think

Here’s the part that really flips the EV market upside down: the tax credits are going away – and sooner than expected.

The $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs will vanish after September 30, 2025 – a full three months earlier than the House originally planned. And it gets more aggressive: leased EVs from non-U.S. automakers lose their credits immediately. The EV charger tax credit also ends in June 2026.

What remains? A manufacturing tax credit for U.S.-built EV batteries, but even that excludes any company with links to China.

This is a major economic pivot. With EVs costing an average of $9,000 more than gas-powered vehicles, losing these incentives could price many buyers out of the market. Analysts are forecasting a 72% drop in projected EV sales over the next decade, along with a possible loss of 80,000 U.S. jobs and $100 billion in expected investment.

Tesla may survive the fallout. But other automakers — like Ford and Hyundai — will likely delay or scale back future EV development. Expect fewer EV ads, slower rollouts, and more conventional models hitting showrooms.

The road ahead: More gas cars, more choice, more questions

So what does all this mean for you, the driver?

Gas-powered vehicles are poised for a strong comeback. With emissions penalties gone and EV credits phasing out, automakers are incentivized to lean back into what already works. Expect more variety, lower prices, and vehicles designed for the actual demands of American families and businesses.

Fuel demand is expected to stay high – and that’s good news for domestic energy production. Oil and gas industries have long warned that EV policy was artificially distorting the market. Now, that distortion is being corrected.

Still, the bill isn’t one-sided. There’s a proposed tax deduction for buyers saddled with auto loan interest – a nod to the growing number of Americans financing vehicles in a high-rate environment. It’s a way to offer relief without distorting the product landscape.

And while an annual $250 EV road-use fee didn’t make it into the final bill, don’t be surprised if that resurfaces in the next round of negotiations. Right now, gas drivers pay federal fuel taxes that help fund roads and infrastructure. EVs pay nothing. That imbalance may not last. This fight could be taken up by the EPA or the Department of Transportation.

Winners and losers: Who’s benefiting and who’s scrambling

This legislation favors automakers willing to build vehicles Americans want – not those chasing regulatory credits. It’s a win for traditional manufacturers, oil and gas workers, and dealers in heartland states where EV demand has always been low.

It’s a loss for global automakers betting big on electric growth in the U.S. market – especially those with heavy investment in Chinese battery supply chains. And it’s a headache for urban planners, utilities, and environmental groups counting on mass EV adoption to hit clean energy targets.

The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), CarMax, and others were were pushing for a longer transition period. They feared a sudden market disruption. Meanwhile, critics of the bill claimed it jeopardizes climate goals, raises future utility bills, and hands the EV lead to countries like China.

Why you should care

This isn’t just a debate about cars or clean air – it’s a fight over how much control government should have over your choices, your money, and your mobility.

Do you want a vehicle that fits your life, your budget, and your needs? Or do you want a central planner in Washington – or Sacramento – dictating your options? That’s the question this bill forces us to ask.

By pulling back mandates, cutting artificial market manipulation, and letting consumers – not bureaucrats – drive the demand, this bill aims to restore sanity to an industry that’s been distorted by politics and ideology for too long.

It’s not perfect, but it’s a start.

So think carefully about what this means, not just for the next car you buy – but for the future of freedom on America’s roads.

Last month at the clean-vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Brett Ivy, a fleet manager for the aerospace company Northrop Grumman, wandered through Angel Stadium’s parking lot, looking at electric trucks and machines that he could potentially buy for his company.

Ivy knows the state isn’t enforcing its truck mandates, so he doesn’t know what his bosses will direct him to do in the future. He said they could abandon electric vehicles altogether.

But Ivy added, who knows what the next administration would bring, and Northrop Grumman has to think long-term. He wants to be prepared to do his job managing the company’s fleet of trucks.

“If we don’t, a new administration might reverse what (Trump) did,” he said. “Then you’re behind.”

The trucking industry, when the mandate was approved in 2023, predicted economic chaos and dysfunction and that it would “fail pretty spectacularly.” With its repeal, Nick Chiappe of the California Trucking Association expects that fleet owners will keep buying hydrogen and electric trucks when it makes economic sense, such as with smaller vehicles with shorter hauls.

“The industry will continue to work with (the air board) on reasonable steps to advance zero-emissions technology but maintain that the programs being rolled back were infeasible from the moment they were proposed,” Chiappe said.

Experts and advocates say California will have to approach clean air policy from many angles — mandates and incentives.

“There is still work that can be done,” said Martinez of Earthjustice. It’ll require “being creative and not losing steam,” he said. “These are big hits (from Trump) but I think still continuing to press on zero-emission vehicles is going to be really critical.”

Craig Segall, a former deputy executive officer for the state Air Resources Board, said the state should set new standards for cars and trucks. “The only thing that EPA is barred from doing is issuing substantially the same – not similar – waivers in the future,” he said. “The state can actually do quite a lot in terms of new standards.”

Segall said the state also should support companies that have already been buying zero-emission trucks with financing programs and get at the root of the transportation problem by expanding mass transit.

Offering incentives to consumers buying clean cars and trucks will be key. But Grundler, when asked whether California has the funds for more incentive programs, answered bluntly: No.

The state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, paid for by its cap and trade market program, typically has around $4 billion for programs related to climate change and air pollution. But because of the large deficit this year, the new budget allocated about $1.5 billion of those cap and trade funds to Cal Fire for fire prevention. It’s unclear how much will be left over for other projects.

In the state’s new budget, $132 million is allocated over the next fiscal year for an air board program offering incentives to truck fleet buyers.There also are creative ways that the state can encourage the purchase of electric cars, said Mary Nichols, the longtime chair of the air board under two previous governors and Newsom. Registration fees or sales taxes could be based on whether a car is gas-powered or electric, she said.

“The state of California has authority over everything relating to what cars can operate on our roads, as long as we're not violating any constitutional requirements that deal with commerce between the states,” Nichols told CalMatters. “There's a wide array of things that the state could do to make it clear that they don't wish to continue having gasoline cars sold in the state of California.”

Tackling 'pollution magnets'

Experts say one of the most impactful policies the state could pursue without federal intervention could be regulating “pollution magnets.” These are hotspots, such as warehouses, ports and airports, that don’t directly pollute, but draw high-polluting vehicles, like diesel trucks and trains into communities.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District is developing a rule that would push the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports to install more charging stations for zero-emission trucks and cargo handling equipment. The district also approved a rule for warehouses that environmentalists call a success. These are known as “indirect source rules” since they regulate a place that is a hotspot.

These types of regulations ""are definitely a leading strategy that California can continue to pursue environmental justice goals, despite the federal government being completely disinterested in environmental justice,” said Brennon Mendez, an environmental law and policy fellow at UCLA School of Law.

Polluting ports, airports and warehouses “should be held responsible for the air pollution that's released into these neighborhoods because of their operations,"" he said.

But while local air districts’ power to enact indirect source rules is well-established, the state’s power to do the same isn’t as clear.

A bill in the Legislature that enshrines the state’s power is opposed by labor and industry groups, especially now that the ports are facing economic uncertainty because of Trump’s tariffs. Assemblymember Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Rancho Cucamonga, said action on the bill is delayed until next year.

Also, a Senate bill would limit the South Coast district’s power to regulate the LA and Long Beach ports, requiring the agency to consider the costs and how ports and their tenants would be reimbursed, as well as the energy use and impacts on workers.

Randolph said it’s always been a struggle for California to slash enough emissions in California to achieve health standards, but now Trump’s actions “make the challenge even steeper and even harder.”

“The fundamental question,” she said, is “how do we continue to make progress…in the short-term and the long-term?”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70ef549/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2148x1128+0+97/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F87%2F00f078094192bfa33059c1bb739a%2Fscreenshot-2025-07-07-at-9-00-50-am.png,N,,2025-07-07 16:24:10.434456

Investment to deliver clean power to millions of homes, cut energy bills and boost energy security.

Government commits over £6 billion of investment to nuclear submarine industrial base to deliver on Strategic Defence Review

Ten thousand jobs will be created as the Government announces a £14.2 billion investment to build Sizewell C nuclear plant as part of the Spending Review, ending years of delay and uncertainty.

The Chancellor is set to confirm the funding at the GMB Congress later today ahead of the Government’s Spending Review, as the Energy Secretary vows a ‘golden age’ of nuclear to boost the UK’s energy security.

The Government’s investment will go towards creating 10,000 jobs, including 1,500 apprenticeships, and support thousands more jobs across the UK.

The company has already signed £330 million in contracts with local companies and will boost supply chains across the UK with 70% of contracts predicted to go to 3,500 British suppliers – supporting new jobs in construction, welding, and hospitality.

The equivalent of around six million of today’s homes will be powered with clean homegrown energy from Sizewell C. The investment in clean, homegrown power brings to an end decades of dithering and delay, with the Government backing the builders in the drive for energy security and kick-starting economic growth.

The announcement comes as the Government is set to confirm one of Europe’s first Small Modular Reactor programmes. This comes alongside record investment in R&D for fusion energy, worth over £2.5 billion over five years. Taken together with Sizewell C, this delivers the biggest nuclear building programme in a generation.

Clean, home-grown power at Sizewell C will help drive the UK’s energy security, as part of the Government’s mission to protect family finances by replacing the UK’s dependency on fossil fuel markets controlled by dictators with homegrown power that we control.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

“Today we are once again investing in Britian’s renewal, with the biggest nuclear building programme in a generation. This landmark decision is our Plan for Change in action.

“We are creating thousands of jobs, kickstarting economic growth and putting more money people’s pockets.”

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

“We will not accept the status quo of failing to invest in the future and energy insecurity for our country.

“We need new nuclear to deliver a golden age of clean energy abundance, because that is the only way to protect family finances, take back control of our energy, and tackle the climate crisis.

“This is the Government’s clean energy mission in action- investing in lower bills and good jobs for energy security.”

Sizewell C

Sizewell C will provide 10,000 people with employment at peak construction and support thousands more jobs across the UK, including 1,500 apprenticeships. The company has already signed £330 million in contracts with local companies and will boost supply chains across the UK with 70% of contracts predicted to go to 3,500 British suppliers – supporting new jobs in construction, welding, and hospitality. Jobs in the nuclear industry pay well above national averages and the government is committed to working with nuclear trade unions such as the GMB, Unite, and Prospect, who will continue to play a pivotal role in building the industry.

Despite the UK’s strong nuclear legacy, opening the world’s first commercial nuclear power station in the 1950s, no new nuclear plant has opened in the UK since 1995, with all of the existing fleet except Sizewell B likely to be phased out by the early 2030s.

Sizewell C was one of eight sites identified in 2009 by then-Energy Secretary Ed Miliband as a potential site for new nuclear. However, the project was not fully funded in the 14 years that followed under subsequent Governments.

The Government’s nuclear programme is now the most ambitious for a generation – once small modular reactors and Sizewell C come online in the 2030s, combined with Hinkley Point C, this will deliver more new nuclear to grid than over the previous half century combined.

Small Modular Reactors

Great British Nuclear is expected to announce the outcome of its small modular reactor competition imminently, the first step towards the goal of driving down costs and unlocking private finance with a long-term ambition to bring forward one of the first SMR fleets in Europe.

The government’s nuclear resurgence will support the UK’s long-term energy security, with small modular reactors expected to power millions of homes with clean energy and help fuel power-hungry industries like AI data centres.

This follows reforms to planning rules announced by the Prime Minister in February 2025 to make it easier to build nuclear across the country – changing the rules to back the builders of this nation, and saying no to the blockers who have strangled our chances of cheaper energy, growth and jobs for far too long.

The government is also looking to provide a route for private sector-led advanced nuclear projects to be deployed in the UK, alongside investing £300m in developing the world’s first non-Russian supply of the advanced fuels needed to run them.

Companies will be able to work with the government to continue their development with potential investment from the National Wealth Fund.

Fusion Energy

The government is also making a record investment in R&D for fusion energy, investing over £2.5 billion over 5 years. This includes progressing the STEP programme (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production), the world-leading fusion plant in Nottinghamshire, creating thousands of new jobs and with the potential to unlock limitless clean power.

This builds on the UK’s global leadership to turbocharge economic growth in the Oxford-Cambridge corridor, while helping deliver the UK’s flagship programme to design and build a prototype fusion power station on the site of a former coal-fired plant.

Defence

To secure the UK as a leader in both civil and defence nuclear, the government is also making continued long-term investment in our Defence Nuclear Enterprise and its industrial base, which is critical for our national security while also being a significant generator of economic opportunities, jobs and growth across the entire country. Further investments in the defence nuclear sector include over £6bn over the SR period to enable a transformation in the capacity, capability and productivity of the UK’s submarine industrial base, including at BAE Systems in Barrow and Rolls-Royce Submarines in Derby – to deliver the increase in the submarine production rate announced in the Strategic Defence Review.

In addition, we will embark on a multi-decade, multi-billion redevelopment of HMNB Clyde, with an initial £250m of funding over 3 years, supporting jobs, skills and growth across the West of Scotland.

The government will also invest over £420m of additional funding in Sheffield Forgemasters, securing 700 existing skilled jobs and creating over 900 new construction roles.

Julia Pyke and Nigel Cann, Joint-Managing Directors of Sizewell C said:

“Today marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Sizewell C, the UK’s first British-owned nuclear power plant in over 30 years. It’s a privilege to be leading a project that will create over 10,000 jobs, secure Britain’s energy future and revitalise the UK’s nuclear industry.

“We aim to showcase British infrastructure at its best – delivering a cleaner, more secure energy future for generations to come.”

Tony Tanushi, GMB Regional Energy Organiser, said:

“Sizewell C is absolutely vital if the UK is to hit net zero

“Nuclear power is essential for clean, affordable, and reliable energy -without new nuclear there can be no net zero.

“Sizewell C will provide thousands of good, skilled, unionised jobs and we look forward to working closely with the Government and Sizewell C to help secure a greener future for this country’s energy sector.”

Mike Clancy, General Secretary of Prospect, said:

“Delivering this funding for Sizewell C is a vital step forward, this project is critical to securing the future of the nuclear industry in the UK.

“New nuclear is essential to achieving net zero, providing a baseload of clean and secure energy, as well as supporting good, unionised jobs.

“Further investment in SMRs and fusion research shows we are finally serious about developing a 21st century nuclear industry. All funding must be backed up by a whole-industry plan to ensure we have the workforce and skills we need for these plans to succeed.”

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said:

“This new nuclear programme will give the country the jobs, the economic growth and the energy security we need to ensure a secure and reliable power supply for the future. This announcement shows the government is serious about new nuclear, and realising the economic benefits that come with it, and will be welcomed in communities the length and breadth of Britain.”",https://www.sizewellc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SZC-OG-banner-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 16:23:11.386664

IAV, a firm focused on the future of mobility, has developed a twin-battery design that pairs two different but complementary chemistries to reduce the cost and environmental impact of manufacturing EV batteries, engineering.com reported.

Instead of relying on lithium-ion cells, the design combines sodium-ion (SIB) and lithium iron phosphate solid-state (LFP-SSB) batteries. SIBs are low-cost and easier to recycle, while LFP-SSBs offer long cycle life and strong energy density.

The system reuses waste heat from one battery to optimize the performance of the other.

Combining the two types creates an energy-saving system that could boost range and efficiency without the high costs of cooling, heating, or mining for lithium-ion batteries, according to engineering.com.

IAV also designed and developed the new battery with minimal waste. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, IAV engineers were able to tweak parameters and simulate the batteries' real-world thermal, chemical, and mechanical behavior.

This validated the effectiveness and efficiency of the battery system without the need for multiple prototypes, per engineering.com, which sped up development while slashing costs and resource waste.

Jakob Hilgert, a technical consultant at IAV, considers the use of diverse cell chemistries ""a promising approach to respond to market fluctuations and at the same time minimize system costs,"" per engineering.com.

IAV is also exploring other innovations, like the use of bipolar technology to maximize volume utilization of lithium-ion batteries.

There are also other companies pursuing similar breakthroughs. For instance, Watt Electric Vehicle Company is developing a solar-powered closed-loop production system. Other automakers are also investing in research and development for better EV chargers and infrastructure.

Energy solutions like these can make EVs more affordable. They could help drive EV adoption, going far beyond the 17.3 million electric cars produced in 2024 alone.

For drivers looking to save even more, pairing an EV with home solar can drastically reduce charging costs. Platforms like EnergySage make it easy to compare quotes from vetted vendors, and can help you save up to $10,000 while minimizing environmental impact.

That hasn’t changed much after the July 4 holiday, either, where average prices in the immediate News Edge listening area, as Monday morning, were roughly $2.77.

It’s $2.97 a gallon in Trigg, $2.65 in Christian, $2.77 in Todd, $2.88 in Caldwell, $2.68 in Hopkins, $2.79 in Lyon, $2.83 in Muhlenberg, $2.69 in Marshall, $2.71 in Calloway and $2.80 in Crittenden County.

Two weeks ago, it was $2.79 a gallon in the region, and one year ago it was $3.03. West Central Kentucky’s price record was hit June 13, 2022, when it was $4.74 per gallon.

The average price of unleaded self-serve gasoline across key spots in the Commonwealth is $2.76 in Bowling Green, $2.73 in Elizabethtown, $3.00 in Louisville, $2.67 in Owensboro and $2.87 in Paducah.

Nationally, gas prices increased eight cents in the final week of June to $3.22 per gallon, as crude oil prices stayed above $70 per barrel — in line with continuing tensions throughout the Middle East. U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities at the end of the month initially sent oil futures to $78 per barrel, but markets have since cooled.

Near the end of June, Iran’s Parliament voted to block the Strait of Hormuz, a critical passage for ships carrying about 20% of global oil supplies, and latest reports indicate that a final decision lies with the country’s Supreme National Security Council. According to officials, most of the cost of a gallon of gas is in direct correlation to the price of crude oil, and as it currently stands, these are still the highest oil prices since mid-February.

However, pump prices are 22 cents cheaper than last June, as oil supply in the market is outweighing demand.

In a mid-year analysis from AAA, the nation’s top 10 most expensive gasoline markets are California ($4.66), Hawaii ($4.48), Washington ($4.44), Oregon ($4.07), Nevada ($3.82), Alaska ($3.73), Illinois ($3.43), Pennsylvania ($3.38), Idaho ($3.38) and Utah ($3.29).

Despite recent federal setbacks to clean energy through the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” electric vehicles remain on a fast track toward mass adoption — reshaping America’s roads, electric grid and job market.

By 2030, market research indicates light-duty EVs should top 30-to-42 million on U.S. roads, up from under 10 million in 2023. Market share has surged from 2% in 2020 to nearly 10% by late 2023, and globally, EVs are already displacing more than 2 million barrels of oil daily — projected to exceed 5 million barrels by decade’s end.

At present, and according insideevs.com, electric vehicles currently account for just 0.15% of U.S. electricity demand.

However, a fully electrified national fleet could draw up to 34% — which would require grid modernization. The average home charger requires 7 kilowatts, but large highway truck stops could demand at least 20 megawatts, and utilities face long lead times — often years — to upgrade transmission systems, while EV chargers can be quickly installed.

Opportunities, officials note, lie in managed charging, vehicle-to-grid technology and virtual power plants that can reduce infrastructure costs by up to 60%, and even act as backup energy sources.

Aging rural systems, cybersecurity and equity concerns remain key barriers in lowering costs across the U.S.

The EV boom also brings workforce shifts, requiring new training for electricians, engineers and auto technicians. Oil giants like Chevron, BP and Shell are reportedly adapting, having all expanded into EV charging and lithium mining ventures in the last decade.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, and as of September 2024, Kentucky had fewer than 12,000 EV’s registered for road use, but as of April 2022, there were about 3,700 electric vehicles registered in the Commonwealth — showcasing more than 200% growth.

Key PFE (i.e. FEOC) provisions

Under the bill as enacted, eligibility for credits is generally denied if the taxpayer is a PFE or where a PFE is involved in aspects of the facility’s development or ownership.

A PFE can be a Specified Foreign Entity (SFE) or a Foreign-Influenced Entity (FIE).

SFE’s are defined as

FEOCs as defined in Section 9901(8) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021;

entities identified as Chinese Military Companies operating in the United States;

entities listed on various U.S. restricted party lists (e.g., the Bureau of Industry and Security’s Entity List or the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act’s Entity List);

Battery-producing entities that are ineligible for Department of Defense contracts; and

Entities owned or controlled by the government, citizens, residents of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), entities organized under the laws of a covered nation, or entities controlled (generally 50%+ direct or indirect interest) by any of the foregoing

FIE’s are defined as entities over which a SFE exercises influence, including through

a right to directly or indirectly appoint a covered officer;

having 25% ownership over the entity;

owning, in the aggregate, alongside other SFE’s at least 40% of the entity;

holding, in the aggregate, at least 15% of the debt of the entity.

FIE’s also include

Entities which makes a payment during the previous taxable year to a SFE that entitles the specified foreign entity effective control over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, or (ii) any eligible component produced by the taxpayer.

Effective control is defined as

agreements that provide contractual counterparties to the taxpayer specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership or debt held.

licensing agreement that allows the contractual counterparty to do the following as it as it relates to aqualified facility, energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component:

Specify/direct sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals utilized,

direct the operation of

limit the utilization of intellectual property or

receive royalties

Material Assistance

The material assistance restrictions may be the most challenging for many taxpayers. The bill as enacted defines the material assistance formula as a “cost ratio” with respect to a qualified facility or a product line producing eligible components, setting forth the minimum threshold by cost of the components, subcomponents and materials that make up such facility or component that must be sourced from non-PFE sources. The bill specifies the threshold percentage per calendar year for qualified facilities, energy storage technology, solar energy components, wind energy components, inverters, qualifying battery components, and applicable critical minerals. The Bill as enacted includes the following material assistance threshold percentages:

Material Assistance Threshold Percentages

Material assistance cost ratio:

With respect to qualified facilities: (1) the total costs to the taxpayer attributable to all manufactured products (including components) which are incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology minus (2) the total cost to the taxpayer attributable to all manufactured products which are incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology and mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited entity divided by the amount described in (1).

With respect to eligible components (1) total direct material costs that are paid or incurred by the taxpayer for production of such eligible components minus (2) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred by the taxpayer for production of such eligible component that are attributable to a prohibited foreign entity, divided by the amount described in (1).

Safe Harbor Tables

The Bill as enacted requires Treasury to issue safe harbor tables before December 31, 2026. Until then taxpayers can use the safe harbor tables listed in Internal Revenue Service Notice 2025-08 as applied to the construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology which begins on or before the date which is 60 days after the date of issuance of the new treasury safe harbor tables.

Penalties

Penalty assessment time period:A deficiency related to meeting the material assistance threshold can be assessed at any time within 6 years after a return was filed.

Standard for penalty: Taxpayer knew or reasonably should have known that certification related to material assistance threshold was inaccurate or false with respect to either (i) whether the property was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity or (ii) the total direct costs of the property that was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity. Taxpayer can avoid penalty is they establish that the inaccuracy/falsity was due to a reasonable cause and not willful neglect.

Penalty amount:

A 1% misstatement of tax liability will trigger a 20% penalty under § 6662(d).

If the inaccuracy/falsity in certifications related to material assistance resulted in understatement of income tax for the respective taxable year by 5% or $100,000, then the penalty will be the greater of (i) 10% of the amount of the underpayment due to the inaccuracy/falsity OR (ii) $5,000.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15723_2410.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 16:26:01.517283

These products are powered by large language models (LLMs), which are essentially very advanced autocomplete tools trained on massive data sets.

Using these artificial intelligence tools requires massive amounts of energy. A recent report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that data centers used about 4% of total US electricity consumption in 2023, and that total is expected to grow as high as 12% within the next three years. This would be more than 500 terawatt-hours (TWh), nearly as much electricity as the entire nation of Germany consumed in 2023.

The scale of individual data centers is also staggering. Amazon is currently building a data center in Indiana that will use as much energy as half the residents in the state. These facilities can also use energy in unpredictable ways, with power demand swinging by up to 20 megawatts (MW) in a fraction of a second, the equivalent of several thousand homes connecting or disconnecting simultaneously from the grid.

The challenge of data centers: can the grid keep up?

All of these factors—the quantity, size, and behavior of data centers—present a tremendous challenge to the grid. Will there be enough energy to supply data centers? Who will pay for the generation and other infrastructure needed to supply this energy? Will the need for new generation stall progress on clean energy goals? All of these issues could affect your electricity bill, your health, and the future of our climate.

Stakeholders including utilities, regulators, governments, and communities are grappling with these questions in forums across the world, and UCS is currently closely involved in one such conversation playing out in Michigan.

Michigan’s first move: new data center requirements

In February, Michigan’s largest electric utility, Consumers Energy, submitted an application to state regulators seeking approval for a proposed set of terms and conditions specific to new data centers. Recognizing their unique characteristics, Consumers Energy proposed to implement four key measures to manage the risks:

Protecting other customers from the risk of reduced reliability by requiring data centers to operate in ways that support a more reliable grid.

Mitigating the risk of increased costs to other customers by implementing minimum contract terms and financial obligations for data centers.

Requiring data centers to cover the costs of investments in the grid needed to serve them.

Charging an upfront administrative fee when data centers apply for interconnection to reduce speculative applications, ensuring that the utility’s costs are covered and that load growth can be more accurately forecast.

In March, UCS and our Michigan coalition partners filed a petition for a contested case, as we believe this important issue deserves detailed scrutiny. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) agreed, ordering a contested case proceeding.

Why the utility’s approach is insufficient

While UCS and our partners are generally supportive of the types of terms Consumers Energy sought in its application, we believe more is needed. A key solution that we and other intervenors wanted to explore was requiring data centers to bring their own clean energy, which addresses both the utility’s existing concerns and the risk of missing renewable and clean energy targets. This solution was a key recommendation of testimony filed by Saad Siddique, an economist and analyst with our partner, the Environmental Law and Policy Center (ELPC). UCS agrees with all of Siddique’s testimony.

Siddique opened by explaining Michigan’s climate law passed in 2023. The law mandates increasing shares of clean and renewable energy, reaching 60% renewable energy by 2035 and 100% low-carbon energy by 2040 (the 100% standard includes renewables along with nuclear and fossil gas power plants that capture and store at least 90% of their carbon emissions).

To ensure compliance with the climate law, utilities must file renewable energy plans (REPs) every two years. Consumers Energy’s latest plan was filed late last year and indicated that the utility is on track to meet its renewable energy obligations for forecast load through 2032, including just over one gigawatt (GW) of data center demand.

However, Siddique pointed out that in Consumers Energy’s filing for the proposed data center requirements it projects anywhere from 3 GW to 15 GW of new data center load, with the lower end of this range considered “probable” by 2035, and the higher end being nearly double the utility’s peak demand today.

Siddique’s testimony explained how both the amount and speed of this growth challenges the utility’s ability to fulfill its clean energy obligations, and that without proactive planning the utility will constantly be playing catch-up. A “business as usual” approach with an REP every two years and no long-term plan for dealing with data centers puts the utility at risk of missing the targets and dramatically increasing costs for all of the utility’s customers.

The challenge with a “business as usual” approach

This conclusion is based on several important facts: new generation takes time to build, large new loads require upgrades to the grid, and rushing the implementation of either one is expensive.

First, factoring in the 3 GW of “probable” new data center load, Siddique calculated that Consumers Energy would need an additional 5 to 6 GW of renewable energy capacity (depending on the mix of wind and solar) by 2035 to meet its obligations, compared to only 2 GW of renewable capacity online as of 2025.

Second, he explains that there is currently a 3 to 4 year backlog of new generators seeking to come online in the MISO grid (which includes Michigan). In addition to this waiting time, Consumers Energy’s own modeling shows a limit of how much new wind and solar can come online in their territory per year in the near term. Renewables procurement is subject to constraints related to insufficient grid infrastructure, securing suitable sites, workforce limitations, and other factors. All of these factors mean that building the 5 to 6 GW of renewables that data center load would require will take time.

Finally, Siddique explains how there are also challenges on the load side. Connecting large new loads typically requires major upgrades to the grid, such as new cables, transformers, and even substations. Building all of that infrastructure takes time, and costs for equipment are rising. Without careful planning and accounting, many of those costs would be passed on to other customers, besides the new data centers. While Consumers Energy’s filing identified some of these risks, the utility did not look at the full suite of solutions, such as local clean energy co-located with data centers, demand management, or cost allocation strategies that would protect other customers from those higher costs.

The case for proactive clean energy integration

Considering the risks and challenges of meeting the clean energy requirements and managing costs, what should the utility do?

As recommended in Siddique’s testimony, Consumers Energy should work with new data centers to require, incentivize, or prioritize solutions that provide clean energy and reduce system costs. The utility can do this by:

Requiring data centers to disclose clean energy plans. First, when applying for interconnection, data centers should be required to provide information about any clean energy they will provide locally, as well as plans for on-site energy storage and demand management. A recent analysis from Wood Mackenzie found that this approach is the most effective method for protecting other customers from the costs of supplying power to data centers, and several utility executives have voiced support for this approach. Such a requirement would also align with climate action commitments that many tech companies have already made.

Prioritizing data centers with the most robust clean energy plans. Consumers would then take these clean energy plans into account when studying system impacts and prioritize applications from data centers who would have the least impact on system costs and the most benefit for complying with clean energy requirements. Prioritizing these applications would incentivize potential customers to develop more robust plans for being better grid citizens.

Siddique also recommended that Consumers create clear pathways for data centers to participate in the company’s existing voluntary green pricing program, where customers opt-in to rates which directly fund renewable energy projects. While this will not affect clean energy compliance directly, it will ease the burden on the company’s obligations and support Michigan’s overall clean energy goals.

Keeping data centers accountable for their commitments. Finally, Siddique encourages clear reporting guidelines that would enable the utility (and the MPSC) to ensure that data centers are fulfilling their obligations around renewables, storage, and demand management.

What’s next—and why it matters beyond Michigan

The next step in this case will be rebuttal testimony, where Siddique and the other witnesses can respond to each other’s testimony. This will be followed by a hearing, and then briefs and replies, where each party lays out their legal arguments backed by witness testimony. A final order in the case is expected by the end of the year.

This case will set an important precedent for how data centers are connected to the grid; DTE, the other major utility in Michigan, will likely file for its own data center requirements in the near future, and other utilities in the Midwest are watching or taking their own steps (see We Energies in Wisconsin, for example). Many of the intervenors in this case represent national interests and will be evaluating what works and what doesn’t as they consider regulation and legislation in other states.

We agree with Siddique: The Michigan Public Service Commission should adopt proactive, comprehensive measures to ensure that data center growth supports, rather than undermines, Michigan’s clean energy transition and protects existing ratepayers from undue financial burden. Such a decision could create a strong template for regulators across the country to follow as they weigh the balance of AI-driven innovation against clean energy goals and energy affordability.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Blog-Thumbnail-Data-Centers-powered-by-AI-illustratio.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 16:23:14.712259

A quick look at Car and Driver‘s list of the year’s top-selling vehicles to date shows plenty of SUVs in the top 10, as well as some truly massive pickup trucks. With more automakers expanding into EVs, it’s not shocking that some of them would be looking to roll out spacious EVs for the U.S. market. Last year, for instance, Toyota announced plans for a three-row electric SUV to be built in Indiana.

Honda had something similar planned — but according to a recent report from Nikkei Asia, shifts in the U.S. market have led the automaker to rethink that proposition. Nikkei’s Shoya Okinaga reports that Honda cited reduced demand in the U.S. for EVs as the reason it decided not to move forward with its own three-row electric SUV. Instead, the automaker is focusing more on hybrid vehicles for the U.S. market.

The cancelled plans for the large SUV are part of a larger financial shift Honda is making. As Nikkei Asia reports, Honda plans to reduce its investment in EVs from a planned 10 trillion yen to seven trillion yen between now and 2030. (Alternately, $69 billion to $48 billion.) To state the obvious, that’s still a lot of money — it’s just not as large an investment as they had originally planned.

At the same time, the new law repeals energy tax credits extended and expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and cuts federal spending – primarily Medicaid – to partly offset the revenue loss from extending expiring tax cuts from President Donald Trump’s first administration.

The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214 on July 3.

Of note, conservative Republicans initially opposed to the bill emerged from talks last with the White House saying that the administration would strictly enforce, and possibly change, the rules for determining when a developer could claim it had “begun construction” for purposes of qualifying for energy tax credits.

For purposes of the effective date of new foreign entity of concern provisions, H.R. 1 requires Treasury to use the current IRS definition of “beginning of construction.” However, H.R. 1 does not appear to require Treasury to stick with the current definition of “beginning of construction” for purposes of the phaseout of energy tax credits themselves.

In relation to the phaseout for the commercial vehicle tax credit, H.R. 1 provides that the credit is not available for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025.

However, in an exchange on the House floor Thursday morning with Rep. Darrin LaHood (R-IL), House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) said “it is the legislative intent that vehicles … be treated as ‘acquired’ as of the date on which a written binding contract is entered into for their acquisition and a payment has been made.”

Deficits, Debt, and PAYGO Sequestration

Overall, the new law is expected to increase federal deficits over the next decade by roughly $4 trillion – including increased interest expenses as a result of those deficits.

Federal borrowing, then, will roughly double from $28 trillion today to roughly $56 trillion by 2035. To avoid defaulting on the debt, the law would also increase the current limit on the federal debt by $5 trillion, which is expected to provide enough borrowing authority to last through the 2026 mid-term federal elections.

What is unclear is how the law will be scored for purposes of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act (PAYGO) purposes. Under PAYGO, the deficit effect of tax and entitlement spending changes must be offset with across-the-board spending cuts (sequestration) to entitlement spending. This would affect federal payments for direct payment bonds and energy tax credit elective payments.

APPA said it will begin discussions with the House and Senate Budget to determine whether PAYGO will be triggered by H.R. 1, and, if so, to begin to make the case for a waiver of PAYGO to protect direct payment bonds and elective pay tax credits.

A summary of other provisions of interest to public power follows:

6 GHz

The new law gives the Federal Communications Commission the authority to auction off federally owned spectrum, including the 6 gigahertz (GHz) band, where many public power utilities and critical infrastructure operators communicate mission-critical information that ensures safety for workers maintaining or restoring electric infrastructure.

The original House passed bill exempted the 6 GHz band from the FCC’s auction authority but the Senate-passed version, which the House approved on July 3, did not.

APPA is suggesting that member utilities operating in the 6 GHz band be prepared to draft a letter to the FCC should spectrum in the band be identified for reallocation and proposed for auction.

NEPA

The law includes a new fee-based streamlined review process for permitting applications under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

The proposal initially included a provision exempting fee-paying applicants from judicial and administrative review of their application. The Senate parliamentarian declared that part of the proposal violated the Byrd Rule, and it was removed.

The remaining provisions were deemed to qualify, including:

• A requirement for the Council on Environmental Quality to provide the relevant lead agency for review and the fee amount to a fee-paying applicant within 15 days.

• A requirement for a project sponsor to declare if they will prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) with agency supervision under NEPA Section 107(f).

• Fees of 125 percent of the anticipated cost to prepare an EA or EIS.

• Deadlines of 180 days for an EA and one year for an EIS.

Energy and Environment

The new law’s energy and environment sections repeal unobligated funding authorized by the IRA for programs at the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including DOE programs that fund electric transmission and offshore wind, as well as EPA programs that fund greenhouse gas reduction and environmental justice.

It would also change eligibility under an IRA created a loan program at DOE’s Loan Program Office, previously authorized to provide loans to finance projects that retool, repower, repurpose, or replace energy infrastructure that has ceased operations or enable operating energy infrastructure to avoid, reduce, utilize or sequester air pollutants or greenhouse gas emissions.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-07 16:26:04.542972

In his foreword to the 2024 Impact Report, Applied’s CEO Gary E. Dickerson says: “Tectonic shifts in technology are reshaping our lives and the global economy.","Applied Materials’ 2024 Impact Report shows a semiconductor manufacturing heavyweight under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint while simultaneously expanding its production base.

The California-based firm has committed to hitting net-zero emissions by 2040, an ambition that collides with the practical demands of running a global business with more than 35,000 employees across 207 cities.

Applied’s progress is laid out target by target in the report, with mixed results – and much of it stems from what’s happening inside its factories.

Inside the numbers: Factory power and product energy

Applied Materials is pushing to source 100% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. So far, 73% of global electricity comes from renewable sources, with its US sites already at 100%.

But, energy is just one part of the equation. The firm also aims to cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions—which cover direct emissions from its operations and those from purchased electricity—by 50% against a 2019 baseline.

However, latest figures show these emissions are 4% higher than they were in 2019. A major factor is the construction and expansion of manufacturing facilities, which naturally adds to energy use, emissions and complexity.

The report outlines progress on reducing energy consumption per wafer pass, a key manufacturing metric that reflects energy used in processing semiconductor wafers. Applied is targeting a 30% improvement by 2030 from a 2019 baseline. As of now, it has achieved a 13% improvement across its semiconductor products.

New energy infrastructure at production sites is starting to show results. The report notes a 48% increase in on-site solar electricity, including a new 700kW solar array at the firm’s Tainan facility, which generated more than 228,000kWh of clean energy in just three months.

Writing on LinkedIn, Chris Librie, Chief Sustainability Officer at Applied Materials, says: “I’m pleased to share that Applied Materials has published our 2024 Impact Report, detailing great progress in reducing our Scope 3 emissions (down 24% since 2022), controlling our Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in spite of business growth and continuing to invest in the communities where we operate.

""We are transforming the future of technology innovation while we anchor purpose at the heart of our business strategy.”

The manufacturing loop: supply chain meets emissions

Manufacturing semiconductors means managing a large, complex supply chain—and Applied Materials puts this at the centre of its sustainability strategy.

According to the report, its supply chain accounts for around 10% of the company’s total carbon footprint. But its suppliers also serve other firms in the industry, multiplying the impact of any changes Applied helps implement.

Each year, Applied surveys suppliers representing 80% of its procurement spend. In 2024, 183 suppliers responded, with 109 providing detailed emissions data from their facilities. Nearly 100 suppliers say they’ve adopted greenhouse gas reduction targets and 23 are now aligned with science-based targets.

Applied continues to work with suppliers to interpret their data, build emissions-reduction plans and transition towards renewable energy. One-on-one conversations are now under way with major partners to assess their readiness to support Applied’s 2040 net-zero goals.

The report says: “Applied continues to collaborate with suppliers, using their provided survey data, to help them create emissions-reduction plans. We also engage a third party to help them calculate their emissions data. In 2024, we began one-on-one conversations with our major suppliers to discuss our net zero aspirations and review their ability to transition their facility and suppliers to renewable energy.”

Applied’s ECO Services offering, launched this year, adds another layer to this approach. The service helps customers—many of which are also manufacturers—track and cut their own utility use and emissions, using data gathered from Applied’s products.

In his foreword to the 2024 Impact Report, Applied’s CEO Gary E. Dickerson says: “Tectonic shifts in technology are reshaping our lives and the global economy. Transformative innovations, like artificial intelligence and the internet of things, have near-infinite potential and we’re only beginning to explore what’s possible. Semiconductors are the foundation of these technological megatrends.

“To scale breakthrough innovations, our industry must confront the environmental and social impacts associated with the exponential advancement of these data-intensive applications. In short, we must drive sustainable growth across our entire ecosystem. As the world’s leading semiconductor and display equipment company, Applied is uniquely positioned to accelerate our industry’s roadmap and enable more energy-efficient computing.”

A day earlier, the U.S. House of Representatives had passed the U.S. Senate’s version of the bill 218-214.

The legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act, largely hampers the ability of projects to qualify for the clean electricity 45Y production tax credit and 48E investment tax credit as specified in the IRA.

OBBB terminates the investment tax credit (ITC) eligibility of wind, solar and energy storage projects placed into service after December 31, 2027. There is an exception for projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment.

Under terms of the IRA, developers had a predictable, multi-year window (at least through 2032) to begin construction and claim the ITC.

“Wind and solar developments face a compressed window to secure [investment tax credits] where projects may want to target commencing construction within the next 12 months to satisfy the start of construction exception,” said the law firm Frost, Brown and Todd.

Other qualifying facilities, such as nuclear, geothermal and clean‑hydrogen projects, remain on the original statutory timeline, phasing down after 2032 at 100% in 2033, 75% in 2034, 50% in 2035 and 0% in 2036.

Similarly, to claim the IRA’s Production Tax Credit (PTC), wind and solar projects that begin construction more than one year after enactment now must be placed into service before the start of 2028. Wind and solar projects starting construction within the first post‑enactment year do not face a placed in-service deadline.

Facilities other than wind and solar follow the established post-2033 phase-out schedule, receiving 100% of the credit if construction begins in 2033, 75% if in 2034, 50% if in 2035, and no credit for projects starting after 2035.

Meanwhile, as part of the OBBB, a tax credit for the production of critical materials is being expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

Renewable energy advocates have called OBBB a death sentence for wind and solar.

According to a report by the Princeton University ZERO Lab, passage of the OBBB would result in $500 billion less investment in clean energy by 2035, sharply increasing greenhouse gas emissions. The law would also cut over 280 GW of new solar and wind capacity through 2035, according to the report.

The return of the Trump administration has meant a shift in U.S. energy policy. Renewable energy is being de-prioritized in favor of firm, dispatchable sources. The administration is prioritizing energy security in an era of exploding artificial intelligence and its energy needs.

“Coal is back,” Trump declared in a July 4 speech, before signing the OBBB into law. “I said you can’t use the word ‘coal’ unless you precede it by saying clean, beautiful coal.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 15:17:18.669883

Nuclear fusion is a long-term bet and has been that way for many years. CFS expects its inaugural ARC power plant, located in in Chesterfield County, Virginia, to put power on the grid in the early 2030s. The plant would be the first grid-scale fusion power plant in the world.

Last December, the MIT spinout reached an agreement with Dominion Energy to provide non-financial collaboration, including development and technical expertise, as well as leasing rights for the proposed site. Dominion currently owns the Chesterfield site.

CFS is currently completing development of its fusion demonstration machine, SPARC, at its headquarters in Devens, Massachusetts. The company said it expects SPARC to produce its first plasma in 2026 and net fusion energy shortly afterward. This would be a significant achievement, as it would be the first time a “commercially relevant” design would produce more power than consumed. In CFS’ eyes, SPARC paves the way for ARC.

Nuclear fusion occurs when two atoms combine to form a single atom. The combined atom has less mass than the original two atoms, with large amounts of energy released in the process. Fusion is considered the holy grail of clean energy because of its potential to produce nearly limitless, carbon-free energy. But getting energy from fusion – the process that powers the sun and stars – has been a great challenge on Earth. Scientists have been trying to replicate it as far back as the 1930s.

But there have been recent breakthroughs. Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California for the first time produced more energy in a nuclear fusion reaction than was used to ignite it, a long-sought accomplishment known as net energy gain.

The extremely brief fusion reaction, which used 192 lasers and temperatures measured at multiple times hotter than the center of the sun, was achieved December 5, 2022.

In August 2023, the laboratory said it had achieved net energy gain once again.

Achieving net energy gain has been challenging because fusion happens at such high temperatures and pressures that it is incredibly difficult to control.

CFS was spun out of MIT in 2018. Since then, it has raised more than $2 billion in capital. In addition to this private capital, CFS has been awarded $16.5 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy. The most recent grant of $15 million was announced in June 2024 as part of the first phase of the DOE’s Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program.

This is Google’s second capital investment in CFS. The tech giant has been an investor in CFS since 2021. Through this latest agreement, Google also has the option to offtake power from additional ARC power plants.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 15:17:23.271385

Recent estimates forecast a 15.8% increase in summer peak electricity demand by 2029 (relative to 2024).
Will the load growth apocalypse mutate into an environmental nightmare?","What does the phrase “load growth” suggest to you?

If you’re not working for an electric utility or regulatory agency, the answer is probably not much. But within the arcane world of distribution and transmission grid operators, state utility regulators and regional wholesale electric market arbiters, “load growth” evokes the kind of visceral chill normal folks might associate with the zombie apocalypse. That’s because after decades of slow and predictable increases in electric demand — along with periods where demand growth was pretty much flat — parts of the United States are now facing a period of accelerating demand that threatens to overwhelm the available supply. Recent estimates forecast a 15.8% increase in summer peak electricity demand by 2029 (relative to 2024). Translation: we need about 118 GWh of additional generation capacity, along with enough new transmission and distribution capacity to deliver it…and we need it fast.

The reasons are easy to understand; the solutions, less so.

The sudden spike in electricity demand is due, primarily, to a combination of three factors:

Data centers, which serve the fast-growing AI industry, operate around the clock and suck down obscene amounts of electricity to feed burgeoning server farms.

Resurgent domestic manufacturing, fed by federal grants, import tariff, and state economic development efforts.

Electrification of the transportation and building sectors, a keystone in many state plans to transition to a cleaner energy future.

Combined, these three factors are driving electricity demand into the stratosphere in several states. Virginia, for example, hosts the highest concentration of data centers in the world; an area in Northern Virginia dubbed Data Center Alley already accounts for 25% of all electricity consumed in the state. The Northeastern states are seeing load growth associated with electrification, while states in the Midwest, Southeast and West are expected to host the largest new industrial loads. By contrast, some other states are seeing little or no load growth.

In response, the affected states and regions are undertaking various types of initiatives. Some are planning big investments in new natural gas generation. Others are delaying planned coal plant retirements. A few states are looking to new technologies, such as small modular nuclear reactors. Regional transmission operators are planning major system upgrades. All this will cost billions of dollars, payable by ratepayers — which is why some state legislatures have introduced bills intended to shield the average utility customer from the full cost associated with these investments. There is a large degree of uncertainty in both the load growth projections and the states’ attempts to accommodate them, so the outcome of these efforts remains to be seen.

Along with these state and regional initiatives comes a host of problems to be solved. Obviously, cost is one concern, but there are others. A major issue for many states is the conflict between serving increased electric load and advancing decarbonization. Currently 24 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have adopted 100% clean energy goals, and most of those goals come due between 2040 and 2050. Buildouts of solar, wind and energy storage will continue in these states, but predictions of massive load growth has provided critics of renewable energy with a new rationale for a return to legacy, i.e., fossil fuel, generation. Although renewable generation and storage are often among the fastest-deployed new energy resources, this fact seems to have been forgotten in the rush to build more gas pipelines and recommission shuttered coal plants. Even the most progressive, pro-renewables states have not, to date, announced bold new clean energy plans to meet heightened electricity demand.

Will states be able to maintain momentum on their clean energy targets? Will short-term load growth solutions saddle ratepayers with decades of debt service and burden the country with a new generation of fossil fuel infrastructure that is too costly to retire? Are renewables and energy storage being deployed as fast as possible, or could the rise of new demand-side programs and virtual power plants help to stave off a new wave of fossil-fuel investments? Will the load growth apocalypse mutate into an environmental nightmare?",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/utility-grid-stock.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 15:17:00.679962

With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.","Submerged in about 40 meters (44 yards) of water off Scotland’s coast, a turbine has been spinning for more than six years to harness the power of ocean tides for electricity — a durability mark that demonstrates the technology’s commercial viability.

Keeping a large, or grid-scale, turbine in place in the harsh sea environment that long is a record that helps pave the way for bigger tidal energy farms and makes it far more appealing to investors, according to the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. Tidal energy projects would be prohibitively expensive if the turbines had to be taken out of the water for maintenance every couple of years.

Tidal energy technologies are still in the early days of their commercial development, but their potential for generating clean energy is big. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, marine energy, a term researchers use to refer to power generated from tides, currents, waves or temperature changes, is the world’s largest untapped renewable energy resource.

The MeyGen tidal energy project off the coast of Scotland has four turbines producing 1.5 megawatts each, enough electricity collectively to power up to 7,000 homes annually. On Thursday, the Swedish company SKF announced that its bearings and seals on one of the turbines had passed the 6 1/2-year mark without needing unplanned or disruptive maintenance. It has been working closely with the industry for a decade on design and testing.

Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a “very significant milestone” that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.

Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy. The MeyGen site, operated by SAE Renewables, has been sending electricity to the grid for about eight years.

There are very few tidal energy projects generating electricity continuously. Most have been tests and demonstrations, said Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development. Copping said there are still large hurdles to overcome before tidal energy can be adopted more widely, such as dealing with regulatory issues, potential environmental effects and conflicts with other ocean users.

Still, the Scotland project seems to have addressed the question of whether the turbines can last in seawater, added Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

“I think they have checked the boxes,” she said. “Because skeptics, and that includes investors of course and governments, said, ‘How on Earth are you going to operate these things especially for any length of time in this very tough environment?’ And that’s what I think they proved.”

It’s very hard to take what is essentially a wind turbine normally found on land and put it under water, said Fraser Johnson, operations and maintenance manager at MeyGen. The record-setting turbine should keep going for at least another year before it needs to come out of the water for maintenance, he added.

The four turbines are in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, a narrow channel between the Scottish mainland and Stroma Island known for strong tidal currents. Tidal energy systems need strong currents to make electricity efficiently. MeyGen plans to add 20 turbines in 2030 to produce more electricity, after needed upgrades to the electricity grid are finished. The site could eventually hold as many as 130 turbines that are more powerful than those at the site today.

The MeyGen site is in the open water, while another type of tidal project involves creating a dam-like structure called a barrage across tidal waters. With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.

“It’s a title we wish we didn’t have. We want more, we want others,” he said. “Unfortunately others are having difficulty achieving what MeyGen has achieved. But working with SKF moving forward, we’ll push the industry forward.”

Clean energy advocates, developers and investors say wind and solar are crucial for the nation’s renewables ambitions, and tax credits help to make them viable.","By ALEXA ST. JOHN | Associated Press

Congress passed a massive tax and spending cuts package Thursday that curbs billions of dollars in spending across clean energy. That means people will be paying a lot more for home solar, energy efficiency, and other green technologies — and the nation’s efforts to address climate change just got a lot more challenging.

The bill supports mining, drilling, and production of the oil, coal, and gas that are largely driving Earth’s warming and the increasingly deadly and costly extreme weather that comes with it. Producing and burning these fossil fuels also contributes to air pollution and human health problems.

At the same time, the bill slashes tax credits for clean technologies, including wind and solar energy. That will likely mean delay or cancellation of countless projects, affecting thousands of jobs and driving up household energy costs.

Here are four things to know about what the bill means for clean energy:

Cuts to home energy credits will make updates more costly

The climate law passed during former President Joe Biden’s term included tax credits for systems and projects at home — like solar and batteries — that save homeowners money over time and significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions.

These systems have gotten cheaper over the years but they’re still hefty upfront expenses that some homeowners would struggle to absorb without the credits. An average rooftop solar installation can run $20,000 or more; the credit has covered almost one-third of that. An average heat pump typically costs several thousand dollars; the tax credit is reimbursed up to 30% of the cost, or $2,000.

The U.S. Treasury Department said more than 2 million families claimed more than $2 billion of the credit for upgrades such as windows, insulation, heating and cooling systems in tax year 2023 returns. More than 1.2 million families claimed more than $6 billion in credit for solar installations, solar water heating, geothermal heat pumps, battery storage, and other improvements that same year.

The bill ends both tax credits at the end of this year.

“No one asked Congress to make their energy bills even higher,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit that advocates for cutting energy waste. “Taking away incentives for energy-saving improvements would raise monthly bills for families and businesses.”

But Republican lawmakers hailed the measure. Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said it helps unleash American energy and will save taxpayers money.

“Extending good tax policy, delivering targeted relief and reining in wasteful spending is the best way to restore economic prosperity and opportunity for all Americans,” he said.

Electric vehicle credits disappear

The bill eliminates credits of up to $7,500 for buyers of new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for buyers of used EVs.

That’s likely to hurt the growth of a technology that is seen as critical to cutting down on a big source of Earth’s warming. Transportation is the largest single source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions — 28% in 2022, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

EV sales have grown steadily, making up about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com. Biden had set a target for half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

But that purchase may be harder for consumers to swallow without a credit. EVs sold for an average of $57,734 in May, while new vehicles overall sold at an average of $48,799, according to Kelley Blue Book.

The credits go away after Sept. 30.

Big wind and solar projects will struggle to qualify for tax credits

For large-scale wind and solar, the bill speeds up the timelines projects must meet to qualify for a tax credit. The industry says it will be nearly impossible for many projects to meet those accelerated timelines, putting massive projects from Colorado to Texas to Arizona at risk.

The bill allows a full tax credit for wind and solar developments that start construction within a year of the law’s enactment. But projects that begin more than a year after the bill’s passage have to be operational by the end of 2027 or they won’t get a credit.

Atlas Public Policy, a policy consultancy, said roughly 28 gigawatts of wind and solar projects are planned to be operational after the start of 2028 but haven’t begun construction yet. Under the bill, they’re unlikely to qualify for a credit.

Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, with a goal of 20% by 2030. Solar is at about 4%, with the industry’s target at one point to reach 30% by the end of the decade.

Clean energy advocates, developers and investors say wind and solar are crucial for the nation’s renewables ambitions, and tax credits help to make them viable. But Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, which calls on signatories to try to keep global temperatures from warming 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.

Instead, the bill supports traditional fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, and coal, as well as nuclear power. Proponents say it will increase reliability since the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine.

“Americans need reliable and affordable energy, wasteful spending needs to be cut, and our country needs to be able to build again,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va, applauding the bill.

Experts say to watch out for higher energy prices

But others say Americans can expect to see higher utility bills. That’s unwelcome news at a time when the nation’s growth in data centers, driven by demand for artificial intelligence, is sending energy use higher and when climate change is fueling more frequent extreme weather.

Nonpartisan and energy groups estimate the bill’s passage could increase average annual electricity costs by more than $100 per household by next year. If fewer solar and wind projects are added to the grid because there is less incentive and it is too expensive for developers to do so without credits, some states could see increases of more than $200.

“At a time when energy demand is surging, and families are already struggling to make ends meet, this bill would raise costs, make the grid less reliable, and make the U.S. more dependent on foreign oil,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of climate action advocacy group Climate Power. “It threatens our power supply just as extreme weather and record demand are putting historic strain on the grid, forcing brownouts and blackouts across the country.”

The loss of tax credits might not immediately impact project plans. However, increased uncertainty makes it more difficult to invest in innovative new technologies and maintain national security.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25181610588399-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 15:18:13.878152

Section 42104 repeals the Diesel Emissions Reduction Program (DERA), Section 60104 of Public Law 117–169 (the Inflation Reduction Act). This EPA program helped fleets pay for the retrofitting or replacement of older diesel trucks. Because many state programs rely on DERA funding, this repeal could trigger ripple effects on local emissions compliance incentives.

Additionally, the bill rescinds Inflation Reduction Act funding originally intended to reduce emissions near freight corridors, schools, and ports (Sections 42105–42108). Without these resources, efforts to mitigate localized pollution from diesel traffic may fall short, putting more pressure on municipalities—and ultimately, fleets.

Regulatory Rollbacks for Diesel Emissions Standards

Perhaps most consequential for future truck development, Section 42201 repeals greenhouse gas and multi-pollutant emission standards issued by the EPA. These rules included long-term limits targeting 2027-plus model year heavy-duty engines, particularly NOx and particulate matter. While repeal could offer near-term regulatory relief for manufacturers and fleets, it also introduces uncertainty for companies that have already invested in technology to meet the upcoming standards.

The section states:

The final rules issued by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to “Revised 2023 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards” (86 Fed. Reg. 74434, Dec. 30, 2021) and “Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles” (89 Fed. Reg. 27842, April 18, 2024) shall have no force or effect.

Additionally, Section 42301 repealed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) rules relating to CAFE Standards, stating:

The final rules issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration relating to “Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Years 2024–2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks” (87 Fed. Reg. 25710, May 2, 2022) and “Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks for Model Years 2027 and Beyond and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans for Model Years 2030 and Beyond” (89 Fed. Reg. 52540, June 24, 2024) shall have no force or effect.

Let’s be clear here: That rule does not apply to heavy-duty Class 7–8 trucks. It applies to:

• Light-duty vehicles

• Medium-duty vehicles, including some commercial diesels (Class 2b–6).

EPA’s Phase 3 GHG rule for heavy-duty trucks, which covers 2027–2032 model years, is a different rule published separately. At this time, H.R. 1 does not explicitly repeal EPA’s heavy-duty GHG Phase 3 rules, but it does grant itself broad authority to roll back climate and emissions regulations elsewhere in the bill.

As a reminder, EPA’s Phase 3 rule was finalized in March 2024. It covers heavy-duty trucks (Classes 7–8) and model years 2027 through 2032, and it sets both carbon-dioxide and pollutant standards for long-haul tractors and vocational vehicles.

Fewer Reporting Requirements

Also worth noting is Section 42111, which repeals funding for corporate greenhouse gas reporting. While this doesn’t directly change emissions requirements, it could relieve some of the compliance pressure on large fleets who were beginning to measure and disclose carbon outputs.",https://s18391.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Volvo-Engine-Service1-1400.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 15:17:42.508264

Avantus says construction is in progress, and the project is expected to be operational in 2026.

Avantus has signed a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for the project with multiple community choice aggregators (CCAs) in the state.

According to the company, the BESS will create up to 250 jobs, and generate tax revenue to support local services in Kern County.

In 2022, Avantus rebranded from 8minute Solar Energy, a move it says was intended to represent the scope of the company’s clean energy products and services.

In 2020, Avantus, under the 8minute name, signed two PPAs with two CCAs for the Aratina Solar Centre.

The CCAs, Monterey Bay Community Power Authority (MBCP), and Silicon Valley Clean Energy (SVCE), are located in the investor-owned utility PG&E’s service area.

Under those agreements, MBCP acquired 120MW of solar capacity and 30MW of battery storage with a three-hour discharge period, while SCVE secured 80MW of solar capacity and 20MW of three-hour discharge battery capacity from the 250MWdc/200MWac power plant.

Last year, Avantus signed a PPA with the utility Arizona Public Service Company (APS) for a 100MW solar PV project in Pinal County, Arizona.

Currently, the company claims to have 30GW of solar and 94GWh of energy storage under development across California and the Southwestern US.

Clearway Energy secures over US$1 billion in credit facilities

US clean energy developer Clearway Energy Group has received corporate credit facilities over US$1 billion.

The company noted that Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking (Natixis CIB) served as the coordinating lead arranger and also took on the role of administrative agent for financing facilities.

The corporate credit facilities include a US$400 million revolving credit facility and a US$350 million letter of credit facility. Additionally, it comprises a US$169 million term loan. Natixis CIB further extended a $100 million letter of credit facility as part of the arrangement.

Clearway has not specified how the money will be used, but PV Tech has asked the company for clarification.

However, it has announced a number of renewable project developments in the US. In April, as part of its financial results announcement, the company noted that it had acquired a 100MW operating solar project in California, which is co-located with a battery energy storage system (BESS), following an announcement that it had signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with technology giant Microsoft to sell electricity generated at a 335MW wind farm in West Virginia.

Max Gardner, treasurer and senior vice president of corporate finance at Clearway, said that the facilities provide Clearway with the “financial headroom and flexibility… to grow and capitalise on the opportunities ahead.”

In addition to Natixis CIB, the facilities saw participation from Joint Lead Arrangers including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, KeyBank, MUFG Bank, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada and Societe Generale.

Arevon secures US$600 million to accelerate renewables portfolio growth in US

Independent power producer (IPP) Arevon Energy has closed a US$600 million credit facility to support its solar PV and energy storage portfolio in the US.

The credit financing includes a US$350 million revolving loan and letter of credit facility as well as a US$250 million project letter of credit facility, with the possibility to increase the credit facility up to US$850 million.

It was led by financial firm Wells Fargo Bank and National Association acted as administrative agent, while Wells Fargo Securities, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, New York Branch, and Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank acted as co-green loan structuring agents and letter of credit issuing banks.

Bob Krakauer, Chief Financial Officer at Arevon. “With this financing, we are well-positioned to continue developing and delivering reliable, cost-effective solar and energy storage solutions that are essential in powering an American energy future.”

Headquartered in the US state of Arizona, the IPP currently owns and operates over 4.7GW of solar PV and energy storage projects across 17 states, while it has a development portfolio of 6GW.

The company is also building an additional 1.5GW of new capacity, including a 430MW solar PV project in Missouri, a state with one of the lowest installed PV capacities in the US, with less than 1GW, according to numbers from trade body the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Construction of the project began less than two months after the IPP secured US$509 million in financing for the Kelso 1 and 2 PV projects.

FAIRFIELD, CA / ACCESS Newswire / July 7, 2025 / Waste Energy Corp (""Waste Energy"" or the ""Company""), (OTCQB:WAST), an emerging leader in sustainable waste-to-energy innovation, today announced it has signed a long-term lease-with an option to purchase nearly four acres of Industrial property in Midland, Texas. The property will host the company's first Waste to Energy conversion system and will serve as the new Waste Energy corporate headquarters.

""Texas generates, refines, and consumes more diesel than any other state in America, giving us unrivaled proximity to feedstock, fuel buyers, and logistics,"" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman & CEO of Waste Energy Corp. ""Our Midland hub puts us at the center of the nation's rising energy needs-driven by the rapid growth of data centers, electric vehicles, and next-generation technologies-at a time when demand for reliable fuel sources are reaching levels not seen in decades. By converting plastic and tire waste into clean-burning (ULSD)ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, we're not just meeting that demand-we're turning one of the world's biggest environmental problems into a powerful energy solution.""

Why Texas? A Century of Fuel Leadership

Historical scale: Texas' 34 refineries can process nearly 6.3 million barrels per day-about one-third of total U.S. capacity.

Top consumer: The state of Texas consumes more ULSD annually than both California and Florida combined, driven by heavy industry, agriculture and freight.

Permian Basin advantage: Midland offers pipeline, rail and interstate access for both incoming waste feedstock and outgoing refined products.

Surging U.S. Power Demand: A Decade of Unprecedented Growth Ahead

The U.S. is entering a new era of energy demand, driven by the explosive growth of data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), Web3 infrastructure, and the reshoring of industrial development:

The U.S. Department of Energy projects data centers alone could consume up to 12% of the nation's electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023.

Goldman Sachs estimates global data center power use will rise by 50% by 2027, fueled by next-gen computing needs.

McKinsey forecasts U.S. data center demand will more than triple to 80 gigawatts by 2030.

In Texas, grid operator ERCOT expects peak power demand to nearly double by 2031, driven by large-scale digital and industrial expansion.

This wave of demand puts enormous pressure on the grid and creates a critical need for reliable backup power and decentralized diesel fuel sources.

WEC domestically produced fuel supports grid resilience, fuels industrial operations, and turns harmful waste into a vital energy solution.

— Marc Chasserot, Founder and Publisher of ATMOsphere

BRUSSELS, BRUSSELS , BELGIUM, July 7, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- ATMOsphere, a global market accelerator of clean cooling and heating solutions and publisher of NaturalRefrigerants.com, has released its second report on the rising threat posed by commonly used HFO refrigerants, particularly HFO-1234yf, and their atmospheric byproduct, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), to human health and the environment.

The new report, available for free, also covers the steps being taken in the EU and North America to regulate HFOs and TFA as PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), a group of chemical pollutants prevalent in the environment. Many f-gas (fluorinated) refrigerants and TFA fall under the widely accepted definition of PFAS as chemicals with at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom.

DOWNLOAD THE REPORT (free)

The report will be discussed on July 10 at an ATMOsphere-hosted side event during the 47th meeting of the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) of the Parties in Bangkok. The event will be held 6 pm to 8 pm ICT in the United Nations Conference Centre’s Asia Pacific Foyer. More information on the event can be found here.

Since ATMOsphere’s first report on this topic was published in 2022, there has been a torrent of research, discussion and regulatory action focused on the environmental proliferation of TFA, driven by refrigerants and other sources and its potential harm to human health. The new report takes a comprehensive look at the activity over the past year, including condensed versions of many articles previously published in NaturalRefrigerants.com.

Increasing concentrations of TFA

When HFO-1234yf and some other f-gases escape into the atmosphere, they produce TFA, which is extremely mobile and water-soluble and is absorbed in rainfall and other precipitation. Once it lands on Earth, TFA, an ultrashort-chain (two-carbon) PFAS, spreads throughout the environment and builds up due to its extreme persistence. TFA can also form trifluoroacetate salts by reacting with calcium or sodium minerals, resulting in a similar environmental effect.

The report provides data on TFA’s consistent upward trend in concentrations in surface water (rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands, as well as ice in arctic regions), rainwater, soil and other environmental media.

TFA ultimately ends up in drinking water, beverages such as wine and food such as bread and cereal products, the report explains. It also includes data on TFA’s presence in the human bloodstream, which has raised concerns about its potential health impacts, especially long term.

Two key studies on the potential health threats to human health are reviewed. One discussed the German government’s assessment of TFA and its trifluoroacetate salts as reproductively toxic, which has been officially submitted to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for consideration under the EU’s CLP (classification, labelling and packaging) regulation. The other reaches the conclusion that TFA represents a “planetary boundary threat.”

The report explains the different approaches taken by major regulatory agencies to HFOs and TFA. For example, while the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not regard f-gases and TFA as PFAS, the state of Maine has enacted a PFAS law banning f-gas refrigerants in 2040, including possible action on TFA in 2032, with exceptions for cases of “currently unavoidable use.”

In addition, Minnesota, under its PFAS law, is engaged in rulemaking to establish a process to determine whether PFAS refrigerants and other products are “essential” to avoid prohibition in 2032; the state is also doing a toxicity review of trifluoroacetate. In Canada, the government is collecting feedback on its proposal to regulate PFAS as a class, excluding fluoropolymers but including HFOs

The biggest regulatory effort is being undertaken by the EU, as the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) evaluates PFAS proposals from five countries to restrict PFAS as a class, including f-gases and TFA. ECHA has also started its consultation and expert evaluation of the German proposal to classify TFA as reproductively toxic under the CLP regulation.

In the meantime, several European countries have issued guidelines for acceptable levels of TFA in drinking water and food. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is reviewing the toxicological values for TFA in cooperation with the ECHA at the request of the European Commission.

The report presents the position of the chemical industry, which has aggressively defended the use of HFOs like HFO-1234yf and downplayed the threat potentially posed by TFA. It also offers responses from a host of leading scientists.

Eliminate TFA precursors

In light of the evidence of potential harm from the growing proliferation of TFA worldwide, the report supports a global effort to eliminate, where possible, the precursors of TFA like HFO-1234yf and other f-gases, as well as TFA-generating pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Effective alternatives to these precursors, such as natural refrigerants, are widely available.

In addition, a number of other steps are needed for TFA, including continuous environmental monitoring, detection improvements, toxicological studies, water treatment research and regulatory limits, said the report, adding that polluters should be required to pay for cleanup.

“With a comprehensive supply chain that encompasses raw material procurement, the manufacture and sale of wood products as well as the supply of housing, we are working to promote the Sumitomo Forestry Wood Cycle in the United States,” Sumitomo stated in a press release announcing the acquisition.

Sumitomo notes one advantage of the acquisition is the ability to secure a stable supply of Southern Yellow Pine that will not be affected by sudden, extreme price increases in building materials or U.S. tariff policies.

“With the current U.S. administration placing importance on the strengthening of domestic manufacturing, the domestic production ratio in a wide variety of industries—including the lumber industry—is rising. The increased cost competitiveness of U.S.-produced wood products will create a favorable market environment for this project,” Sumitomo states.

The Energy Department report blames the expected shortfall on the closures of coal and natural gas power plants and the over-reliance on renewable energy. The analysis, which comes in response to an executive order from the White House on strengthening grid reliability and security, provides a methodology to identify areas vulnerable to outages to allow for “Federal reliability interventions.”

US Warns of Blackouts in Precursor to Help Coal Back to video

Article content

Blackouts could increase 100 times within five years if planned power plant closures remain on schedule without new units to replace them, the Energy Department said in the report. “Staying on the present course would undermine U.S. economic growth, national security, and leadership in emerging technologies,” it said.

Article content

The report backs President Donald Trump’s pro-coal and anti-renewable approach to energy generation, painting wind and solar as unreliable and part of a “radical green agenda of past administrations.” It also comes as the Energy Department has been using emergency authority to extend the life of coal and other plants, citing concerns about shortages of electricity as data centers, which power artificial intelligence models, require more supply.

Article content

“If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

Article content

The department noted the analysis could inform use of the emergency authority in the Federal Power Act to order coal and natural gas plants to keep operating, which the administration has already used to save two plants that were slated to retire. Trump administration officials considered using similar authority during the president’s first term to help struggling coal plants from shutting down, but ultimately decided against the effort.

The report also comes on the heels of Trump’s $3.4 trillion fiscal package, which marked a deep setback to the US shift to clean energy by phasing out tax credits wind turbines and solar panels. Renewables were positioned to be leading providers of energy supply in coming years, with utility-scale solar last year accounting for 61% of US capacity additions, or 30 gigawatts, according to the Energy Information Administration.

The bill claws back funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration's landmark climate legislation, and changes or cuts energy and manufacturing tax credits.
Baldwin says many of the tax credits the bill cuts have been in place for decades, but the IRA expanded their reach, and added supplemental programs.
""It looked like we had an off-ramp to 2032 to see these tax credits dissipate,"" he said.
Instantly removing these tax credits at the end of the year is gonna be extremely detrimental.","On Thursday July 3, the House of Representatives passed the budget bill, known as the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' which included sweeping cuts to renewable energy tax credits and programs.

The bill claws back funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration's landmark climate legislation, and changes or cuts energy and manufacturing tax credits. For example, solar and wind energy that are built and come online after 2027 will no longer be eligible for tax credits, significantly reducing the timeline for any projects to get off the ground.

The oil and gas industry, as well as mining, come out ahead in the bill. It reduces royalty rates that operators pay for oil and gas production on federal lands, and includes leasing mandates for federal land and water. There's also a mandatory expansion of federal land to be made available for mining.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, solar and battery storage made up over 80% of the nation's new electric generating capacity in 2024. That trend is expected to continue into 2025, with officials saying solar will be driving much of the growth in capacity.

Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) said during a virtual press conference on July 2 that some of the more harmful provisions in the Senate's bill, like an excise tax on solar panels, were removed, but still, the economic impacts of rescinding tax credits would be devastating.

""We're going to gut hundreds of billions of dollars in the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy investments,"" he said. ""This (was) a transformational moment to address climate change, and we weren't solving it, but this was a major step towards addressing climate change, and now… it's like running into a brick wall.""

""We got over 8 thousand solar jobs, just in Colorado,"" he said.

Nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation (EI) says these cuts will mean less capacity for the nation's increasingly strained power grid. The group estimates that by 2030, there will be a 340 gigawatt decrease in generation capacity.

Sara Baldwin, the group's senior electrification director, says this could harm fast-growing regions like the Mountain West.

""We would see a net loss of generation capacity that we would have otherwise seen built by 2035 in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, to the tune of eight gigawatts,"" she said. That's enough energy to power 6 million homes.

EI estimates that because of the increasing reliance on coal and fossil fuels, the nation's emissions would go up by 160 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2030, or the equivalent of adding 72 million cars to the road. Baldwin says for mountain areas like the Front Range and the Wasatch Front, which struggle with poor air quality, public health would be threatened.

Baldwin says many of the tax credits the bill cuts have been in place for decades, but the IRA expanded their reach, and added supplemental programs. She estimates that across the three states, there would be a loss of over 17,000 jobs by the year 2030.

""When you take something like a longstanding production and investment tax credit away from these businesses that are trying to create jobs in America, you are telling them that you do not respect the business that they have, and you do not want them to do that job creation here in the U.S.""

On average, EI estimates that Colorado and Utah households would see an increase in yearly utility costs of about $300. That number is about $150 in Wyoming.

Josh Shipley owns a small solar company, Alternative Power Enterprises, in Ridgway and Montrose, and he participated in Hickenlooper's press call on the impacts of the bill.

""It looked like we had an off-ramp to 2032 to see these tax credits dissipate,"" he said. ""That was imperative in our business plan. That was part of how we were able to afford to continue on this company of now 30+ years. Instantly removing these tax credits at the end of the year is gonna be extremely detrimental. We actually don't believe we're going to be able to stay in business.""

Shipley says his business is one of just two installers in the area, and this could hurt the community's ability to lower their energy costs. He says tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act have allowed his business to expand, helping people on the Western Slope reduce their energy costs.

""In the last handful of years, we've actually been able to start helping low income families be able to go solar,"" he said. ""I think in the last three years, over 120 families have benefitted from that.""

Sara Baldwin says the bill essentially takes the country back in time to a previous era.

""They chose to compromise quality of life, American jobs, domestic energy production, in order to give billionaires more tax breaks and more tax cuts,"" she said. ""(That's) also to say nothing of the fact that they're taking away healthcare from millions of Americans who need it. They're taking away social safety nets from millions of Americans that count on those.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fffcfe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0a%2Fdb%2F3c56a94b448cafc384e3fc498ad3%2Fbyron-komenik-farm-solar-panels.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 14:25:28.464059

Climate change is driving more extreme rain storms across much of the U.S., which drop more water in shorter periods of time and make dangerous floods more likely.
This can cause dangerous flash floods, when water rises quickly and is moving swiftly.
And climate change is making such floods even worse.
In 2021, flash floods from the remnants of Hurricane Ida killed dozens of people in the Northeastern U.S., after making landfall in Louisiana.","The catastrophic flash floods in Texas over the weekend were caused by extremely heavy rain. Up to 12 inches of rain fell in South Central Texas in the early hours of July 4th, according to National Weather Service radar estimates.

Climate change is driving more extreme rain storms across much of the U.S., which drop more water in shorter periods of time and make dangerous floods more likely.

That's what happened in Texas last week. When a large amount of rain falls very quickly, the ground can't soak up the water. If the terrain is even a little bit hilly, all that excess water is funneled into low areas, picking up speed as it flows downstream. This can cause dangerous flash floods, when water rises quickly and is moving swiftly.

The part of Texas that flooded last week is known as Flash Flood Alley because of its impermeable limestone hills and frequent downpours, but these floods were unusually severe for the area.

And climate change is making such floods even worse.

That's because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. That extra water vapor means storms can drop more rain than in the past. Today, the heaviest rainstorms in Texas drop about 20% more water than they did in the late 1950s, when the planet was significantly cooler, according to the National Climate Assessment. And extreme rain in Texas is expected to get much more frequent in the coming decade, as the climate warms even more, according to a 2024 report by the Texas state climatologist.

It's not just Texas. Across the U.S., the heaviest storms are projected to drop more rain as the planet continues to warm.

We don't know yet how much climate change contributed to this particular storm. An initial analysis by a group of European scientists estimates that climate change may have caused slightly more rain to fall during the July 4 storm. Scientists will be able to do more accurate analyses as more detailed data from Texas become available in the coming days and weeks.

Friday's rain was particularly intense because the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry were moving over Texas after the storm made landfall last week in Mexico. As the Earth warms, tropical storms and hurricanes are dumping more rain than they used to. Most of the excess heat that humans have trapped on Earth has been soaked up by the oceans, and warmer ocean water combined with warmer air in the atmosphere makes large, wet storms more likely.

Such storms can cause deadly flooding very far inland, a phenomenon that was on full display last year when Hurricane Helene caused devastating flooding in Appalachia. In 2021, flash floods from the remnants of Hurricane Ida killed dozens of people in the Northeastern U.S., after making landfall in Louisiana.

More than one third of the estimated $230 billion of damage caused by inland flooding in the U.S. between 1988 and 2021 would not have happened without human-caused climate change, according to the National Climate Assessment.

Outdated rain data hampers predictions and preparations

The flash floods in South Central Texas washed out roads and bridges, and swept away buildings and RVs along the Guadalupe River.

Despite the growing risks, many communities around the country are still not planning for more intense rainstorms as they build roads, floodways and storm infrastructure. That's in part because local governments around the country rely on historical rainfall records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, to plan flood control systems. But in some places, the records are decades old, meaning they don't reflect how rainstorms have already gotten more intense in most of the country.

In Texas's Harris County, which includes Houston, NOAA updated the rainfall records in 2018 and found that extreme storms – those that have a 1% chance of occurring in any given year – now drop almost 18 inches of rain, compared to 13 inches prior to the 1960s and 70s.

That increase meant that one-third of the major roads and highways in Harris County are vulnerable to flooding. To respond to the growing risk, the county's flood infrastructure plan became $150 million to $200 million more expensive, largely due to the flood safety needs.

FAIRFIELD, CA / ACCESS Newswire / July 7, 2025 / Waste Energy Corp (""Waste Energy"" or the ""Company""), (OTCQB:WAST), an emerging leader in sustainable waste-to-energy innovation, today announced it has signed a long-term lease-with an option to purchase nearly four acres of Industrial property in Midland, Texas. The property will host the company's first Waste to Energy conversion system and will serve as the new Waste Energy corporate headquarters.

""Texas generates, refines, and consumes more diesel than any other state in America, giving us unrivaled proximity to feedstock, fuel buyers, and logistics,"" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman & CEO of Waste Energy Corp. ""Our Midland hub puts us at the center of the nation's rising energy needs-driven by the rapid growth of data centers, electric vehicles, and next-generation technologies-at a time when demand for reliable fuel sources are reaching levels not seen in decades. By converting plastic and tire waste into clean-burning (ULSD)ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, we're not just meeting that demand-we're turning one of the world's biggest environmental problems into a powerful energy solution.""

Why Texas? A Century of Fuel Leadership

Historical scale: Texas' 34 refineries can process nearly 6.3 million barrels per day-about one-third of total U.S. capacity.

Top consumer: The state of Texas consumes more ULSD annually than both California and Florida combined, driven by heavy industry, agriculture and freight.

Permian Basin advantage: Midland offers pipeline, rail and interstate access for both incoming waste feedstock and outgoing refined products.

Surging U.S. Power Demand: A Decade of Unprecedented Growth Ahead

The U.S. is entering a new era of energy demand, driven by the explosive growth of data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), Web3 infrastructure, and the reshoring of industrial development:

The U.S. Department of Energy projects data centers alone could consume up to 12% of the nation's electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023.

Goldman Sachs estimates global data center power use will rise by 50% by 2027, fueled by next-gen computing needs.

McKinsey forecasts U.S. data center demand will more than triple to 80 gigawatts by 2030.

In Texas, grid operator ERCOT expects peak power demand to nearly double by 2031, driven by large-scale digital and industrial expansion.

This wave of demand puts enormous pressure on the grid and creates a critical need for reliable backup power and decentralized diesel fuel sources.

WEC domestically produced fuel supports grid resilience, fuels industrial operations, and turns harmful waste into a vital energy solution.

But as technology has advanced, the possibilities for accessing using geothermal energy have become expansive, including heating and cooling, electricity production, and even energy storage.

Since the 1970s, scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey have worked to quantify the potential of this enormous resource. Last month, USGS published a new assessment, showing how harnessing geothermal heat in the Great Basin that could be accessed using emerging technologies.

They found that if current technologies work as projected, the Great Basin alone could provide energy to meet 10% of all electricity needs in the U.S. If geothermal technology continues to advance in coming years, the Great Basin could meet far more of the nation’s electricity needs, perhaps even most.

During the energy crisis in the 1970s, the U.S. began eyeing geothermal heat as a potentially important source of baseload energy – the base level of demand on electrical grids. Geothermal heat remains appealing as a renewable and reliable resource that could be added to the U.S.’s energy portfolio.

But where are accessible geothermal resources? And how much energy could they provide?

Enter USGS science.

In 1975, the USGS published the first ever assessment of conventional geothermal resources in the U.S., mapping the locations of hydrothermal systems in the western U.S., Alaska and Hawaii. These systems occur in geologically active locations often marked by hot springs and geysers, where naturally circulating groundwater brings the Earth’s heat to the surface. This heated water can then be used to create steam that turns a turbine, generating electricity.

Today, the U.S. produces more power from geothermal power plants than any other country – but power from geothermal still makes up less than 1% of the Nation’s total power generation.

“Our science here at USGS has shown that there is enormous untapped potential for geothermal energy in the U.S. using a range of conventional and emerging technologies,” said Erick Burns, a USGS research hydrologist who leads the Geothermal Resources Investigations Project.

In 2008, the USGS estimated that, using modern technology, the U.S. could generate 9,000 Megawatts of electricity (MWe) from identified conventional geothermal systems alone – or roughly enough to power 5 to 9 million homes.

The USGS also estimated that the U.S. likely contains significant undiscovered conventional geothermal resources, including mostly “hidden” hydrothermal systems that aren’t obvious at the surface (unlike hot springs). Undiscovered resources have an estimated untapped potential of an additional 30,000 MWe – enough to power an additional 18 to 30 million homes, or enough to power every home in California - and, at the high end, Texas as well.

The development of geothermal resources has traditionally been centered on these natural hydrothermal systems, where circulating groundwater brings heat closer to the Earth’s surface.

New technologies, however, are opening up the possibility to access geothermal resources in hot rock without natural circulation, vastly expanding the potential to harness the geothermal potential of the Earth.",https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/styles/teaser/public/vhp_img202.jpg?itok=tbIER4Q-,N,,2025-07-07 16:24:02.264687

Montrose Environmental Group’s PFAS remediation and research division aims to help “future-proof” its customers’ remediation efforts amid uncertainties with state and federal regulations.

PFAS contamination concerns are a growing issue across the country, with some states taking a closer look at how to manage the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in biosolids, landfill leachate and drinking water. At the same time, the U.S. EPA recently rolled back some parts of its PFAS drinking water standard, a move that could impact demand for some types of PFAS remediation services.

While some industries have decided to take a wait-and-see approach on PFAS regulations before investing in remediation, some landfill operators and waste industry customers have taken the lead on implementing such technologies, said Dave Kempisty, vice president of technology for research and development at Montrose.

Montrose has recently worked with companies like Waste Connections on landfill leachate management tech. It recently invested more time and energy into its PFAS R&D division in an effort to advance water treatment, detection and testing technologies.

“A lot of my time is spent on handling how to find better ways to tackle PFAS challenges, both analytically and treatment-wise,” he said.

Kempisty talked with Waste Dive about Montrose’s strategies for designing bespoke PFAS solutions meant to weather future uncertainties over regulations and remediation demands.

This conversation was edited for length and clarity.

WASTE DIVE: Montrose offers PFAS services to a range of industries. Where does the landfill and overall waste sector fit into your services portfolio, and what kind of services or assistance are operators asking for?

KEMPISTY: Landfills are definitely an active area for us, and we have a treatment technology that seems to work really well for the landfill space, which is foam fractionation. We have other offerings that work well, but foam fractionation avoids a lot of pre-treatment. With landfill leachate, you don't have to get it to drinking water or non-detect kind of levels, though we also have those technologies and could clean it to that level, too.

We've had two landfills come to us recently for the application of this treatment technology to treat their PFAS. One of them was driven by regulatory-based measures in Michigan, and they have industrial pre-treatment permits that they have to meet before the landfill can discharge their leachate to a wastewater recovery facility or wastewater treatment plant. So they were compelled by the state's IPP program.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Waste Dive free daily newsletter

A second example is a company that was not compelled by regulations. They were in a different state, but they had multiple landfills, and they were trying to get ahead of things and like, what will this cost? What will this look like? How robust is it? How operator friendly or not friendly is it?

We analyzed their landfill leachate characteristics and we put in this foam fractionation technology, and now they're operating as a hub and spoke model. They'll truck in landfill leachate from different landfills, and we're able to continuously treat that landfill leachate from different locations for them. That's not compelled by regulation. So we've seen both sides of this from a customer perspective

We recently saw federal PFAS regulations for drinking water rolled back. How does that change what customers are coming to you for or how you approach your service offerings?

It’s tough to read the tea leaves as far as what the administration is going to do, or how fast the administration is going to move. There’s some slowdown, but we've still seen inquiries and customers that still want to talk. I work in research and development, where we want to understand the best treatment train for a particular kind of water. Landfill A has different water than landfill B, so just because a particular treatment worked with landfill A doesn't mean that's going to work with B.

We have not seen a decrease in appetite for bench scale work, or even pilot scale work, to show that we can remove this from your particular water. Landfills are still moving forward with PFAS remediation at a pretty good pace. Whereas on the larger scale, industrial wise, we've seen some other types of customers do the wait-and-see approach. Maybe that’s because landfills are one of the more mature industries that was moving forward and was getting to that stage where we know the methods have been documented and demonstrated.

There's also quite a bit of interest in the destruction of PFAS and different technologies that can get you there. For all of them, you need to concentrate the PFAS beforehand to make that economically viable, maybe through a process like foam fractionation or regenerable ion exchange resin. After we produce this concentrate, we work with a variety of vendors that can do, say, super critical water oxidation, hydrothermal alkaline treatment or electrochemical oxidation.

We're technology agnostic, and I don't think there's going to be one winner that wins the destruction race. It depends on a variety of reasons why you'd go with one over another. We look at which one has the greatest efficacy, and look at power requirements, and look at volume and throughput capacity and things of that nature.

Another aspect is the municipal side and drinking water treatment. One consideration is what to do with the waste residuals. Say you use granular activated carbon as a treatment method, and it’s all spent or it no longer has capacity to take in more PFAS. What do you do with it? You can landfill it, or you can reactivate the carbon.

If they were to put shorter-chain PFAS compounds into a drinking water maximum contaminant level regulation, granular activated carbon would struggle with that. An ion exchange method does well with that, and can remove that, but eventually you're going to exhaust the ion exchange resin, and so you're going to put that in a landfill too.

We've got a regenerable ion exchange offering where we can pass an alcohol brine solution through the resin that removes the PFAS, so you can use the resin again and again. It helps with waste minimization, and if you're not generating as much waste there's not nearly as much future liability. And you can get to these lower levels by performing more regenerations. The cost of a regeneration versus the cost of buying new media is fractional, about 1/10 the price.

This kind of reuse offering is a big part of our drinking water market, and we're hoping it's going to get bigger.

Another driver in the PFAS remediation market seems to be the regulation of PFAS in biosolids, most recently in places like Maine and Texas. Where does Montrose see itself in that sphere?

We're definitely seeing some good results with biosolids. It’s a big challenge, and a challenge I think is really interesting. You remove the PFAS in two phases: the wastewater and the biosolids. One of our products, called NanoSorb, can remove the PFAS from the wastewater, and that puts it in the biosolids. Your biosolids were already impacted, and now they're impacted slightly more. That didn't resonate that well with the community.

There’s now much more interest on the biosolids side, so we've configured ways to use the same technology, but to treat further upstream in the process to get a more concentrated treatment. The biosolids produced downstream are not PFAS free, but they're now under the thresholds that have been established by various states.

Biosolids are going to be a big liability in the coming years, and we're exploring more treatment possibilities and talking to customers and piloting options and showing our work with data to say, “Here's what we can do for you.” We've had a lot of interest in that, and though we have no full-scale systems to date on that, it’s something we’re actively working on.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/aWnHVyJLO9Sut3sS7XqlaGRlZB-y0ilvPFDv1JgfX5U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9FQ1QyXy1fQ2hhbXBfTGFuZGZpbGxfUEZBU19GYWNpbGl0eV9JbnNpZGVfQnVpbGRpbmdfMjU4Xy1fQ29weS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-07-07 14:25:07.741590

With the passage and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, automotive and manufacturing groups were quick to point out how the action will benefit domestic production as well as encourage investment in the U.S.

While an electric vehicle advocacy group saw the act’s implementation as a setback for EV adoption, wider availability and growing affordability should preserve the momentum as consumers continue to seek alternative powered cars and trucks.

Here’s what industry groups are saying:

Alliance for Automotive Innovation says the act will keep the auto industry healthy

“Lots of smart policies in the reconciliation bill to keep the auto industry in America healthy and competitive,” John Bozzella, president and CEO of the group, said in a statement.

“The big one: the advanced manufacturing production credit (aka 45X). The Senate recognized this tax credit is working – bringing battery manufacturing back to the U.S. and supporting supply chains that bypass China,” said Bozzella. “By restoring the workability of this key credit and maintaining prohibitions against Chinese companies from credit eligibility, senators preserved billions in auto-related manufacturing investments and jobs.

“Also positive: The Senate protected ultra-wideband spectrum used by the auto industry for safety and convenience features,” he added. “And they declined to impose new fees on electric vehicles and batteries. That’s a debate that should occur when Congress takes up a highway bill in the future.

“We recognized Congress was likely to wind down the consumer EV credits (aka 30D and 45W) early,” Bozzella said. “The accelerated phaseout to September 2025 will be extremely challenging to EV adoption and hurt consumer affordability, especially as manufacturers and dealers right-size automotive inventories.

“Like I said, lots to like,” he said. “Not perfect but given the auto industry’s outsized impact on the country’s economic and national security, we appreciate the inclusion of these policies.”

National Association of Manufacturers calls the bill ‘a historic victory’

“When leaders partner with manufacturers, good things happen for our country—because manufacturing is nonpartisan and bipartisan,” said Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers. “To invest in manufacturing is to invest in America—in communities in every state and of every size.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Automotive Dive free daily newsletter

“While this bill passed on a party-line vote, manufacturers all across America, in red states and blue states, swing districts and safe districts, look forward to putting people to work, more factories into motion, more innovation into the market, more products onto our shelves and more prosperity into our communities. Taken together, this strengthens the hand of the United States on the world stage,” Timmons added. “That’s exactly what this bill helps to deliver.

“This Congress and this administration understand that a stronger manufacturing sector means a stronger America,” the statement continued. “We will continue to work with our nation’s leaders to realize and celebrate the benefits of a comprehensive manufacturing strategy that includes not only further tax reforms but also trade, energy, workforce development and modernized regulations.”

SEMA says legislation provided tax certainty

“[The] Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) supported this bill because it provides much-needed tax certainty to American businesses and includes several key provisions that benefit SEMA’s member companies,” said the organization’s president and CEO Mike Spagnola. “I cannot stress enough how much of a win this is for the automotive aftermarket and the businesses who help it thrive.”

Association of Equipment Manufacturers says bill will sustain jobs

“The Association of Equipment Manufacturers applauds the U.S. Senate's passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act — a historic bill that will strengthen U.S. manufacturing, providing the certainty in the tax code necessary for equipment manufacturers to innovate, invest, and create more family-sustaining jobs right here in America,” said Kip Eideberg, SVP of government and industry relations. “By extending and expanding the tax reforms from 2017, the OBBB will help equipment manufacturers build more in America, while also bolstering our global competitiveness.”

MEMA, the Vehicle Suppliers Association, says legislation will boost competitiveness

""These measures in the tax bill are of great importance, especially to vehicle suppliers who represent the largest sector of manufacturing jobs in the country with more than 932,000 associates,” said President and CEO Bill Long. “The 'One Big Beautiful Bill' renews central items from the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and provides critical certainty for suppliers on several business provisions by making them permanent. This measure enhances national tax policy, a cornerstone of U.S. manufacturing competitiveness.”

Autos Drive America calls the act ‘critical wins for automakers’

“Autos Drive America appreciates the important work of the House and Senate over these past months and strongly supports the permanent, pro-growth provisions in the tax reconciliation package,” President and CEO Jennifer Safavian, said in a statement. “While we recognize the bill’s provisions to phase out key EV tax credits and impose new limits on manufacturing incentives, it’s essential that the U.S. remain a global leader in next-generation vehicle technologies.

“Autos Drive America is committed to working with Congress and the Trump administration to advance practical, forward-looking policies that support continued investment in American jobs, innovation, and supply chains, and ensure the U.S. remains a global leader in automotive manufacturing,” she said.

Zero Emission Transportation Association says electric vehicle adoption may be slowed but consumer interest still grows

“Batteries and electric vehicles are the future. Nearly every major automotive CEO agrees with this sentiment, and it has been publicly echoed by many of the elected officials who voted to pass the legislation,” ZETA Executive Director Albert Gore said in a statement. “Global sales of passenger EVs have increased nearly 800% over the last seven years and now represent more than a quarter of global car sales.”

”While this bill does significant harm to the speed at which the EV and battery sector can continue to scale up capacity in the United States, it will not stop the progress we have made in a very short timeframe,” said Gore.

“Our future is not dictated by the latest political headwinds, but by the strength of our products, the confidence of our customers, and the importance of maintaining American auto dominance in an increasingly competitive global market,” he said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/4xqdOGjOlKhTmluBrkZrPzlNp_40gdk8xap4GLYU4gw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNjYyOTMyNzE3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-07 14:23:43.705765

In view of the unfolding weather tragedy in Texas and the onset of hurricane season, it seems ironic that the administration has made cuts at the National Weather Service and is on track to discontinue weather data sharing with local entities.

In addition, the Defense Department is ending data sharing with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in effect blinding predictions of local severe weather. As the administration is not forthcoming as to its reasons, we are left to conjecture while local first responders are cleaning up and finding bodies.

Could lives have been saved in Texas? Could lives be lost in the coming hurricane season because of lack of warnings? We may never know, but it’s already past time for the media to start aggressively demanding explanations.

To the Editor:

More than 80 people died this weekend — including at least 27 girls and staff members at Camp Mystic in Texas, who were swept away and drowned during a flash flood that tore through their campsite. A tragedy, yes. But not a surprise.

Climate disasters are no longer freakish occurrences. They’re accelerating: more heat, more rain, more tornadoes, more lives lost. But Republicans continue to treat the environment as a nuisance — and science as optional. Chanting “Drill, baby, drill” and making deep cuts at the National Weather Service and other climate data entities aren’t policy. They’re denial.

Gutting environmental regulations and cutting weather watch programs, as the Trump administration has already aggressively done, comes at a cost. And that cost is measured in lives, not dollars.

The G.O.P. denies that any of this is man-made. Meanwhile, scientists shout from the rooftops: These events are getting worse because of human action — or rather inaction — yet only human action can fix it.

The only way to save human lives is a change of government. Going forward, Democrats should make this their refrain: It’s the environment, stupid.

As yet another flood kills scores of Americans and devastates vast swaths of America, let the record reflect that the G.O.P.’s “big, beautiful bill” gutted key federal efforts to address the climate change that is the root cause of such environmental carnage.

Re “What an Immigration Crackdown Does to a Society,” by Chandran Kukathas (Opinion guest essay, July 3):

I read this essay as a call to arms — not in the physical sense, but a moral one. It reminds us as citizens that we must awaken the empathy that lies in each of us, an empathy that allows us to understand the situations of others.

Ultimately this empathy redounds to our benefit because we can imagine how we would feel if we were treated the way our immigrant neighbors are being treated. It might inspire us to create a Camelot instead of an Alcatraz.

The author strongly underscores the effect on our society when we allow others to suffer such indignities and deprivations.

NEW YORK STATE · July 3, 2025

Already, the state’s green energy businesses are feeling the impact of the pending Congressional spending bill that includes phasing out Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.

By Clara Hemphill , New York Focus

Update: The House passed the bill shortly after publication and President Trump is expected to sign it by July 4 as planned.

Amy Albenda Hill wanted to power her Hudson Valley home in Tarrytown with green energy — solar panels on the roof, a geothermal heating system underground, and an electric vehicle in the driveway. She knew the initial investment would be expensive, but went ahead after her husband Adam discovered that federal tax credits would lower the cost by 30 percent.

“It would have been completely out of the question without the tax credits,” Adam said.

The Hills are among the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who have taken advantage of tax breaks for eco-friendly home improvement projects under President Joe Biden’s signature 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The credits make it cheaper to install energy-efficient insulation, new windows, skylights, heat pumps, or solar panels — projects that reduce heating and cooling costs and help mitigate climate change.

Now, Republicans in Congress are poised to gut those clean energy tax credits, which President Donald Trump has called a “giant SCAM.” On Tuesday, the US Senate passed a giant tax and spending bill that includes phasing out the tax credits, sending it back to the House, which passed its own version of the bill in May and worked through Wednesday night with the aim of approving the final package by Trump’s July 4 deadline.

“The Senate passed a reckless reconciliation bill that would be a devastating blow to New York’s economy and a clean energy future,” the New York League of Conservation Voters said in a statement on Wednesday. “If this bill is passed, it will mean higher electricity costs and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs for New Yorkers.”

Already, green energy businesses are feeling the impact. Customers are reluctant to install solar panels or a geothermal heating system with the tax credits in doubt.

“It’s completely devastating,” said Rob Feuer, owner of Geothermal Works in New Rochelle. “It’s like you turned off a faucet.”

His company builds geothermal heating and cooling systems for homes that transfer heat energy from deep in the earth, where the temperature is always 52 degrees. “By this time last year, we had 30 jobs. Now, we’re down to three,” Feuer said.

“It’s going to become incredibly challenging for businesses to sell solar when the upfront cost to a consumer is now 30 percent higher.”

—Noah Ginsburg, executive director, New York Solar Energy Industries Association

Oliver Koehler, founder and owner of SunTegra Solar, a small Westchester business that builds and sells solar shingles for homes, said he’s going out of business and laying off his two employees. “The current administration has really put a death sentence on the residential part of the solar business,” Koehler said.

Noah Ginsburg, executive director of the New York Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, estimates half of the 16,000 solar energy jobs in New York state will be lost if the credits expire.

“It’s folks who are involved in the marketing, sales, design, project management, financing, and, of course, the construction and operation of solar energy systems in the state,” Ginsburg said.

“It’s going to become incredibly challenging for businesses to sell solar when the upfront cost to a consumer is now 30 percent higher.”

President Donald Trump has long disparaged the Inflation Reduction Act as the “Green New Scam” and calls solar power “ridiculous.”

Green energy tax credits sparked a surge in renewable energy, including solar farms and battery storage facilities, which store energy from solar farms to use when the sun doesn’t shine. For example, NineDot Energy has built battery farms in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Westchester that Con Edison uses to store electricity to release at times of peak demand.

Manufacturing has also received a boost. A factory in Wellsville, in the foothills of the Appalachian mountains near the Pennsylvania border, used to produce parts for coal-fired power plants. With tax breaks from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Ljungström factory retooled to produce parts for wind turbines to be mounted off the coast of Long Island. The Port of Coeymans, on the Hudson River south of Albany, is also producing parts for wind turbines.

All told, renewable energy projects have created more than 4,000 construction jobs and $1 billion in investment in New York since 2022, according to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, a research and policy group, for New York Focus.

Companies have announced an additional $780 million in planned investments that would create about 14,000 construction jobs and 4,000 permanent jobs in New York state, according to the analysis.

What happens to these projects now is anyone’s guess, said Hannah Hess, associate director of the Rhodium Group.

“It’s wait and see,” Hess said. “We would consider all of the facilities that are under construction or have not yet broken ground to be at risk.”

The debate puts New York’s Republicans in Congress in a tight spot. Many of the economic benefits of clean energy, such as the jobs from two giant wind farms under construction off the coast of Long Island, flow to Republican districts. Three Republican congressmen — Mike Lawler of the Hudson Valley and Andrew Garbarino and Nick LaLota of Long Island — lobbied unsuccessfully to maintain certain tax credits in the House bill.

On June 6, they signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune asking him to tweak the bill to allow credits for projects that have begun construction, such as Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind, the two wind power projects.

The Senate version of the bill does protect projects that are already under construction, but phases out residential credits for solar and geothermal power by the end of the year. It adds tight construction deadlines for large-scale solar and wind projects that hope to keep their tax credits, and adds complex — some say unworkable — restrictions on imported materials for projects that begin after the end of this year.

The tax changes come on top of Trump’s tariffs, which dealt a major blow to a clean energy industry that is heavily dependent on imported parts. At SunTegra Solar, for example, Koehler buys framing and mounting materials from businesses in New York and assembles them locally — but buys one component, called a solar laminate, from Vietnam.

“We have a container sitting in Vietnam that we can’t ship because the tariff rate has become exorbitant,” he said.

The goods are worth $50,000. The tariff is $100,000.

New York state provides its own incentives for solar and geothermal power and electric vehicles, separate from federal tax credits. Homeowners who install solar panels get a state tax rebate of up to $5,000. Some localities provide property tax relief, and local utilities such as ConEdison give rebates for customers who install solar power. These state programs would not be affected by Washington budget cuts.

But the federal incentives are far larger than anything New York provides.

New York “cannot be expected to fill all funding commitments that the federal government has reversed course on,” the state energy authority NYSERDA said in a statement.

Ginsburg at NYSEIA said the state could reduce red tape for solar project permits and restore state funding — which was reduced this spring — for small-scale solar projects.

“What’s happening at the federal level constitutes an existential threat to our industry, but there are a lot of things that the state of New York could do to support the local solar industry and to prevent layoffs in the next six months,” Ginsburg said.

Feuer, at Geothermal Works, is optimistic he’ll find work — if not installing geothermal systems, then something else. But he’s worried about the implications for the planet.

“The whole country was moving toward a more sustainable world for our children and grandchildren, and now that’s in jeopardy,” he said.",https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/images/AP22223776856946.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 16:26:11.888444

The MeyGen tidal energy project off the coast of Scotland has four turbines producing 1.5 megawatts each, enough electricity collectively to power up to 7,000 homes annually.
Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a “very significant milestone” that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.
Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy.
With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.","Submerged in about 40 meters (44 yards) of water off Scotland’s coast, a turbine has been spinning for more than six years to harness the power of ocean tides for electricity — a durability mark that demonstrates the technology’s commercial viability.

Keeping a large, or grid-scale, turbine in place in the harsh sea environment that long is a record that helps pave the way for bigger tidal energy farms and makes it far more appealing to investors, according to the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. Tidal energy projects would be prohibitively expensive if the turbines had to be taken out of the water for maintenance every couple of years.

Tidal energy technologies are still in the early days of their commercial development, but their potential for generating clean energy is big. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, marine energy, a term researchers use to refer to power generated from tides, currents, waves or temperature changes, is the world’s largest untapped renewable energy resource.

The MeyGen tidal energy project off the coast of Scotland has four turbines producing 1.5 megawatts each, enough electricity collectively to power up to 7,000 homes annually. On Thursday, the Swedish company SKF announced that its bearings and seals on one of the turbines had passed the 6 1/2-year mark without needing unplanned or disruptive maintenance. It has been working closely with the industry for a decade on design and testing.

Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a “very significant milestone” that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.

Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy. The MeyGen site, operated by SAE Renewables, has been sending electricity to the grid for about eight years.

There are very few tidal energy projects generating electricity continuously. Most have been tests and demonstrations, said Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development. Copping said there are still large hurdles to overcome before tidal energy can be adopted more widely, such as dealing with regulatory issues, potential environmental effects and conflicts with other ocean users.

Still, the Scotland project seems to have addressed the question of whether the turbines can last in seawater, added Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

“I think they have checked the boxes,” she said. “Because skeptics, and that includes investors of course and governments, said, ‘How on Earth are you going to operate these things especially for any length of time in this very tough environment?’ And that’s what I think they proved.”

It’s very hard to take what is essentially a wind turbine normally found on land and put it under water, said Fraser Johnson, operations and maintenance manager at MeyGen. The record-setting turbine should keep going for at least another year before it needs to come out of the water for maintenance, he added.

The four turbines are in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, a narrow channel between the Scottish mainland and Stroma Island known for strong tidal currents. Tidal energy systems need strong currents to make electricity efficiently. MeyGen plans to add 20 turbines in 2030 to produce more electricity, after needed upgrades to the electricity grid are finished. The site could eventually hold as many as 130 turbines that are more powerful than those at the site today.

The MeyGen site is in the open water, while another type of tidal project involves creating a dam-like structure called a barrage across tidal waters. With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.

“It’s a title we wish we didn’t have. We want more, we want others,” he said. “Unfortunately others are having difficulty achieving what MeyGen has achieved. But working with SKF moving forward, we’ll push the industry forward.”

PLANO, TX, UNITED STATES, July 7, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- United Energy LNG and Power LNG announced today the signing of a strategic merger that will create a scalable small-scale LNG platform serving industrial, power, and transport markets across North America.

The combined entity, operating under United Energy LNG (UE LNG), immediately oversees a portfolio of three LNG production sites in advanced stages of development. UE LNG is announcing the commencement of Front-End Loading Phase 1 (FEL-1) at its first project site in Houston, Texas, with a second confidential site underway. A third site in Independence, Kansas is scheduled to begin FEL-1 later this month. With geographic diversity and early-stage capacity, UE LNG aims to expand LNG access for high-demand domestic users. “While the majors are focused on megaprojects, we’re deploying modular, nimble solutions that get LNG to the people and industries who need it now.” said Brian Guinn, Chief Executive Officer of United Energy LNG.

Modular LNG for Distributed Markets

Unlike traditional LNG developments requiring multi-billion-dollar investments and long permitting timelines, United Energy LNG is focused on scalable, regionally targeted solutions:

 Small-scale liquefaction units designed for local and regional demand

 Modular deployment to reduce lead times and capital intensity

 Focused on inland, onshore, and distributed energy applications

 Virtual pipeline logistics to bypass pipeline constraints

This approach enables faster project execution and cost-effective access to clean fuels

for underserved markets.

Addressing Gaps in the U.S. LNG Infrastructure Landscape

Despite global LNG investment nearing $200 billion annually, small-scale LNG remains the least crowded, most overlooked frontier in U.S. energy. Major players focus on export, while decentralized markets remain stranded. That gap is UE LNG’s advantage.

“This merger represents the alignment of speed, innovation, and execution,” said Austin Terry, CEO of Power LNG. “By combining our development and operational expertise with United Energy’s capital platform, we’re unlocking a scalable model for delivering LNG where it’s needed most.”

Inside the Transaction

The merger combines United Energy’s upstream operating experience and public market presence with Power LNG’s permitting progress, engineering capabilities, and pipeline of modular projects. Key metrics include:

 3 Active Development Sites across Texas, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast

 Targeted Liquefaction Capacity of up to 540,000 MTPA at full deployment

 Estimated Capital Investment: $240–270 million across three facilities

 Cash flow projections targeting breakeven within 12–18 months post-commissioning

 Engineering, procurement, and strategic project management partnerships

 Public market access via United Energy LNG’s parent company (OTCMKTS:

UNRG)

Distributed LNG for Energy Transition Applications - UE LNG’s modular platform is being developed to serve:

 Remote and underserved power generation sites

 Heavy-duty transportation and marine fueling networks

 Critical infrastructure requiring fuel resilience

 Industrial operations seeking lower-emission alternatives to diesel and propane

Outlook and Commercial Pathway

United Energy LNG plans to reach financial close on its first three facilities by Q1 2026, with commissioning expected by Q1 2027. The company is actively engaging with feedgas suppliers, utilities, and logistics providers to build out a nationwide virtual LNG delivery network. The company estimates that its addressable domestic market exceeds 2 billion cubic feet equivalent annually, representing a $3+ billion opportunity in underserved power, transport, and industrial sectors. “This is just the beginning,” said Guinn. “By 2028, we aim to operate a network of scalable LNG hubs serving a portfolio of contracted customers across the U.S., turning America’s natural gas into clean, distributed power for everyone.”

In its current form, the bill would rapidly phase out Biden administration-era tax credits for wind and solar projects, requiring those projects to either break ground within one year or come online by the end of 2027 to access the credits; eliminate tax credits for new and used electric vehicles purchased after Sept. 30 of this year; repeal Inflation Reduction Act funding for numerous emission-reduction programs; and terminate tax credits for home energy efficiency upgrades, including rooftop solar, electric heat pumps and insulation, at the end of 2025.

“The passage of this bill is going to raise prices for consumers, it is going to cut wages for workers and it’s going to make us more reliant on natural gas, which is incredibly expensive right now,” Scott Cuddy, a former state representative and current director of membership development at the the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 1253, told The Maine Monitor. “We’re just looking at losing, losing and losing.”

Maine’s entire congressional delegation — Sens. Susan Collins (R) and Angus King (I) and Reps. Chellie Pingree (D) and Jared Golden (D) — voted against the package. Collins cited the bill’s clean energy rollbacks in a statement explaining her ‘no’ vote.

“The tax credits that energy entrepreneurs have relied on should have been gradually phased out so as not to waste the work that has already been put into these innovative new projects and prevent them from being completed,” she said. “The bill should have also retained incentives for Maine families who choose to install heat pumps and residential solar panels.”

Ahead of the Senate vote, dozens of Maine organizations, businesses, community leaders and labor unions sent a letter urging the two Senators to oppose the bill’s proposed cuts to clean energy investments.

Anya Fetcher, federal policy advocate at the Natural Resource Council of Maine, one of the organizations that signed onto the letter, noted that the bill threatens to slow Maine’s transition to local renewable energy and in turn “prolong the amount of time it takes to drive down energy costs for households and for Maine to reach its [climate] goals.”

The Republican push to get Trump’s policy agenda across the finish line comes on the heels of Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signing into law a bill to speed up the state’s transition away from polluting energy sources, with a new target of reaching 100 percent clean electricity by 2040.

To date, clean energy funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, both of which were passed during the Biden administration, have supported nearly $3 billion in direct and public-private investments in Maine, according to NRCM’s analysis of data from Rhodium Group’s Clean Investment Monitor.

The budget megabill could lead to a loss of 760,000 jobs nationally by 2030 and average household energy costs increasing $170 per year over the next decade according to a recent analysis from Energy Innovations, an energy and climate think tank.

In Maine, 1,600 jobs are forecast to evaporate and average household energy costs are expected to rise $80 per year by 2035, Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovation and one of the authors of the report, told The Maine Monitor after crunching state-level data.

“Maine already has quite high power prices,” O’Brien said in an email. “But by passing a renewable standard last month, the legislature is effectively shielding Mainers from some of the price spikes and volatility of imported thermal fuels. Sure, the cost of adding new renewables will go up due to repealed tax credits, but there will be so much less gas and petroleum use on the grid that power prices won’t increase to quite the same degree as in states with heavy grid fossil reliance.”

Yet Maine began feeling impacts of the GOP budget bill well before this week’s legislative battle on Capitol Hill, with at least two planned solar projects — a 100 megawatt facility in Cherryfield and a 140-megawatt array in Hartland — being put on hold and hours for union electricians quickly drying up, according to Cuddy.

Given the climate threat that Maine and the rest of the country is facing, Cuddy views the legislation as worse than the old idiom “cutting off your nose to spite your face.”

“We’re like blasting our nose off our face,” he said. “We’re using TNT up each nostril to blow our nose off of our face here. We are injuring ourselves economically in the short term, and in the long term we are making the problem that is causing some of our economic woes even worse. The bill just confounds me.”

“We’ve been working to sell people on this concept of win, win, win: We fight climate change, we create good jobs, we help the environment and we save people money,” he added. “That’s what we’re doing away with.”

Most of America’s transmission lines are more than 50 years old, and date back to the 1950-60s. The American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid a D+ grade. As we use more electronics, build new factories, and continue to grow AI data centers, our electricity demand increases. But our outdated grid cannot keep up.

When the grid fails, it’s not just an inconvenience. Blackouts mean straining hospitals, fire departments, and police, as well as safety threats and lack of heating and cooling during extreme weather. Recent tornados and high winds across the central US this year have shown how a weak grid can leave communities without power for days. Expanded transmission strengthens the grid against extreme weather by creating alternative pathways for electricity to move, giving us the flexibility to handle emergencies by moving electricity from where it’s available to where it’s needed most.

Energy storage also plays a critical role. When used as a transmission and distribution asset, storage can relieve congestion on overloaded lines, provide backup during outages, and reduce the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. By storing electricity during periods of low demand and discharging it when demand spikes or outages occur, storage supports grid stability and enhances resilience.

More transmission also improves efficiency by easing power transfer between regions to meet demand. When power can’t move easily between regions, areas with high demand cannot access cheaper power, leaving households and businesses with higher bills. Expanded transmission networks are the backbone of a strong, affordable, and reliable energy system, letting us tap into the cheapest sources of power. New transmission also makes it easier to bring new resources online, presenting an all-of-the-above opportunity for various energy sources to serve consumers across the country.

Building new or expanded transmission lines not only increases reliability and resiliency, it creates good-paying jobs. Over one million Americans are currently employed in transmission, distribution and storage. Expanding transmission will create jobs in construction, maintenance, and operation. Reliable transmission also attracts manufacturing and new businesses, creating economic growth and job opportunities.

Today, building new transmission lines is slow and complicated, often tangled in red tape between states and regions. We need to update the rules so projects can move forward quickly and fairly. A stronger grid means fewer blackouts, lower bills, and more jobs. It’s a win for families, businesses, and our entire economy. Let’s invest in America’s future by investing in the power network we all depend on.",https://feeds.newsusa.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_size_rss_feed/public/2025-07/shutterstock_134011310.jpg?itok=WeIMvpxY,N,,2025-07-07 16:27:44.920755

The OBBBA will hurt Americans’ wallets

America was on track to add a lot more energy to the grid through the rapid growth of the clean energy industry. However, the OBBBA rolls back clean energy tax credits that energy developers were relying on to make that growth happen. Without these incentives, many clean energy projects will get cancelled and leave the U.S. with less energy than it needs in a time of rising energy demand. The Trump administration and Congress are attempting to offset this reduction of electricity supply with more fossil fuel development. However, relying more on fossil fuels for electricity will only end up raising consumer costs due to their higher operating and maintenance costs compared with clean energy.

The OBBBA would increase average annual electricity costs by $110 per household as early as next year, with some states seeing more than $200 increases annually.

By reducing the generation of the affordable clean energy added to the grid, the bill will leave Americans with higher energy bills. The OBBBA would increase average annual electricity costs by $110 per household as early as next year, with some states seeing more than $200 increases annually. Businesses also face increased costs of nearly 10 percent by 2026, and these additional costs would likely be passed on to consumers. On top of electricity costs, this bill would raise gasoline prices by between 25 cents to 37 cents per gallon by 2035, meaning that Americans will pay the oil industry an additional $339 billion in gasoline revenues by 2035.

The OBBBA will have negative impacts on Americans’ health

The OBBBA recklessly repeals lifesaving incentives for weather resilience, energy efficiency, and improved air quality in American communities. Baked into the OBBBA are cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act’s federally funded initiatives, such as air pollution monitoring, cleaning up ports, home energy efficiency upgrades, and emissions-free school buses.

Increases in local air pollution as a result of the OBBBA will likely lead to 430 avoidable deaths every year by 2030 and 930 by 2035.

By tossing these programs aside and gutting the clean energy incentives, the federal government will deepen the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels and increase pollution associated with fossil fuels in communities. Fossil fuel emissions include planet-warming carbon dioxide, as well as cancer- and asthma-inducing particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides. In just five years, these harmful emissions will increase by 160 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent—equal to cutting down more than 2.6 billion new trees grown in urban and suburban areas Increases in local air pollution as a result of the OBBBA will likely lead to 430 avoidable deaths every year by 2030 and 930 by 2035. Fossil-fueled air pollution already costs each American an average of $2,500 per year in extra medical bills. On top of the bill’s cuts to Medicaid—which will leave millions of Americans uninsured and create thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket health care costs—the OBBBA’s repeal of emissions-reducing incentives only increases the threat level and strain of air pollution on Americans’ public health.

Some of these harms will be irreversible and will haunt Americans for years to come.

The OBBBA risks Americans’ personal safety

The OBBBA will reduce overall energy additions to the grid by at least 50 percent and comes at a time when the U.S. electric grid is already under stress from skyrocketing electricity demand and rising extreme weather events. Congressional Republicans’ budget bill would remove enough clean energy supply from the grid to power 90 percent of homes in the United States.*

In June, a life-threatening heat wave swept through parts of the country, resulting in blackouts in several states, leaving approximately 80,000 people without power and a way to stay cool at home and demonstrating the need for more reliable energy generation. Extreme weather events are the leading cause of electric power outages. More Americans face weather-related power outages and, as a result, are at risk for numerous health concerns including gastrointestinal illness and heart attacks. The failure to add new energy sources such as wind and solar to the grid quickly and affordably can expose more Americans to unsafe conditions during times of high energy demand or extreme weather events that are becoming increasingly common due to climate change.

310M

Metric tons of additional carbon dioxide equivalent that will result from the OBBBA by 2035.

The provisions repealed and rolled-back from the Inflation Reduction Act in the OBBBA were designed to help the United States get on a track to meet pollution-reduction targets to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. Now, the consequences of the OBBBA will increase greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 310 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2035, increasing risks associated with climate change such as wildfires and hurricanes. From worker safety in extreme heat, to rising rates of preventable injuries and violence due to climate change, to the increasing severity of threats to the electric grid, the setbacks that the OBBBA will enshrine for the climate risks Americans’ safety and livelihoods.

Conclusion

That the One Big Beautiful Bill Act increases costs and hurts U.S. businesses and jobs is bad enough, but the act also increases pollution and threatens the safety of Americans in a changing climate. And why? To give more money to the ultra-wealthy and corporations, including roughly $15 billion in tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry. Congressional Republicans’ bill will have ugly consequences that will take years to reverse. Some of these harms will be irreversible and will haunt Americans for years to come.

Strengthening the clean energy workforce is about more than meeting job demand.","(NewsUSA) - The path to a sustainable energy future hinges not only on wind, solar, and battery storage systems—but also on the skilled individuals who build, maintain, and operate them. A diverse, well-trained workforce is essential to the future of clean energy. Yet, too often, investments focus exclusively on technology, overlooking the people who make these innovations possible.

Clean energy currently provides direct, indirect, and induced good-paying jobs for approximately 1.4 million Americans. Roles such as wind turbine technicians and solar installers rank among the fastest-growing careers in the nation. Consider the case of wind turbine technicians: these professionals install, maintain, and repair turbines, ensuring energy continues to flow with minimal downtime. Entry into the field requires no prior degree or experience, and a starting salary between $45,000 and $65,000 is achievable after just 6–8 weeks of basic safety and technical training, followed by on-the-job training for in-field application of skills. These facts underscore the clean energy sector’s capacity to offer accessible and upwardly mobile careers, often times in rural and disadvantaged areas.

Veterans also play a particularly vital role in this transition, comprising 9% of the clean energy workforce—a figure higher than the average for other industries. With leadership, discipline, and technical expertise developed through service, veterans are uniquely positioned to succeed in clean energy roles.

Despite clean energy jobs now outpacing fossil fuel roles nearly three to one, continued progress depends on sustained investment in workforce development. Scaling training programs across a range of skills—from welding and electrical work to trouble-shooting and project management—is essential. Prioritizing underserved populations, including veterans, women, rural communities, and traditional energy workers, will help ensure that the energy transition is both equitable and robust.

Federal and state leaders are elevating workforce development as a national priority, especially for skilled trades. Earlier this year, the White House issued executive orders elevating programming for career and technical education and directing federal agencies to expand pathways to high-paying trade jobs of the future. And at the state level, workforce development remains a key policy focus, with bipartisan support for expanding career and technical education programs.

Strengthening the clean energy workforce is about more than meeting job demand. It is a catalyst for regional revitalization, economic opportunity, and enhanced national competitiveness. The clean energy future is not a distant goal—it is being realized now, through the efforts of skilled technicians, engineers, and project managers across the country.

Trump administration turns its back on climate costs All these compelling stories came amid the backdrop of a slew of actions that the Trump administration is taking to make confronting and responding to the climate crisis even more difficult.","On June 18, the Union of Concerned Scientists co-hosted an extreme weather “People’s Hearing” in Asheville, NC along with partners, including the Climate Action Campaign, Appalachian Voices, Western NC Sierra Club, Western NC Physicians for Social Responsibility, Mountain True, Moms Clean Air Force, Extreme Weather Survivors, and others.

The event was an opportunity for local residents and experts to share their testimonies about the impacts of Hurricane Helene and voice their opposition to harmful actions taken by the Trump administration to worsen the climate crisis. These include rolling back EPA standards to cut power plant carbon emissions, expanding fossil fuel production and use, and also undermining our ability to prepare for and respond to events like Hurricane Helene which devastated Western North Carolina last year.

I live a short two-hour drive away in Knoxville, TN and decided to make the trip to support the event and meet local community members and fellow organizers, most of whom I’d only seen on a Zoom screen. I was admittedly a bit worried on the drive there when a torrential downpour stopped traffic on Interstate 40 as water began to pool on the roadway that only recently re-opened after being damaged by Helene last year. In an eerily timed coincidence, a rockslide caused by the deluge damaged the interstate yet again and resulted in it being closed roughly an hour after I passed through on my way to Asheville. Thankfully, no injuries occurred as a result of the rockslide, but according to the National Weather Service, between 2.5 and 3.5 inches of rain fell in a short amount of time to cause it.

This was exactly the kind of extreme weather event that we are seeing all over the country during “Danger Season,” the time from roughly May to October when the US experiences the worst climate impacts, and was a reminder of a theme that arose during the event: there are no “climate havens” immune to the impacts of climate change.

Hearing it first-hand

Luckily, the I-40 closure and wet weather didn’t seem to affect turnout at the event too much. Over 175 people came to bear witness, 31 individuals shared their testimony, and several local elected officials were present to receive the testimony, including Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer. The EPA was invited to the event to hear public testimony but did not have a representative present.

The testimonies were a mix of heartbreak, outrage, and resilience. All told, at least 250 people lost their lives during Helene and its aftermath, the majority of whom were in the Asheville area. The storm resulted in even more injuries, and thousands of homes were damaged. In fact, Helene was the costliest single disaster in 2024 in the U.S. The rural and mountainous nature of the region made rescue and recovery efforts even more challenging, and there was not a single speaker at the event who had not been impacted in some way. Many in the audience indicated that they lost power or water for days or weeks, and several had lost friends or family members.

“We’re here because silence is no longer survivable, and because survival should not depend on your zip code, your income, or whether your community was profitable enough to protect,” Asheville resident Sam Hartman said, stating her reason for attending and speaking out. Like so many disasters in the U.S., Helene hit low-income and other marginalized communities hardest.

Beyond physical and economic impacts from the storm, many people are still dealing with mental health impacts even after much of the physical damage has been repaired: “having to run for your life with whatever you can grab is hard enough on anyone. For those who are already in a challenging place, it’s much worse,” said mental health counselor Janet Canfield.

A representative of United Food & Commercial Workers Union local 2598 spoke about the plight of so many workers dependent on the large eco-tourism market in Asheville who struggled to make ends meet despite the large profits generated from their services. Many of these workers have never recovered from Helene’s devastation. Local jeweler Alice Scott told the story of when local officials said she could get up to 4 feet of water in her store, but instead she got twenty-six feet, which destroyed her business and livelihood.

First responders are often first to arrive on scene when disasters strike, and Helene was no different. And, just like other folks, first responders get scared too: “One thing I think people can sometimes forget is that firefighters, we get scared just like you get scared, and we have moments when we rise above that fear just like you,” said Capt. Welcker Taylor, president of the Asheville Firefighters Association.

Trump administration turns its back on climate costs

All these compelling stories came amid the backdrop of a slew of actions that the Trump administration is taking to make confronting and responding to the climate crisis even more difficult.

The week before the Asheville People’s Hearing, Trump’s EPA announced its plans to roll back the power plant carbon standards finalized by the Biden administration, which are meant to curb climate-warming pollution at coal and gas-fired power plants, and re-opened loopholes for dangerous mercury pollution. Rather than upholding its mission to protect people and the environment, EPA is doing the opposite: “Yet another day when the Trump administration proves it can somehow go lower still in its disregard for people’s health and well-being. These are astoundingly shameful proposals. It’s galling to watch the US government so thoroughly debase itself as it sacrifices the public good to boost the bottom line of fossil fuel executives,” my colleague Julie McNamara said in a statement on the proposals.

The EPA, following administrator Lee Zeldin’s anti-science and anti-public health agenda, also just sent its proposal to reconsider EPA’s greenhouse gas endangerment finding to the White House Office of Management and Budget. This bedrock science-based finding underpins EPA’s responsibility to regulate GHGs—which the Supreme Court previously ruled are air pollutants that are covered under the Clean Air Act—because of the harms they pose to public health. We need EPA to act to limit this health-harming pollution and stop looking for ways to evade that responsibility.

To make matters worse, the Trump administration and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are working to dismantle the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and leave responding to disasters like Helene up to states which have neither the resources nor capacity to do so.

People demand action

Speakers at the event let EPA and those in attendance know where they stood on these actions:

“The EPA wants to repeal almost 30 clean air and water rules that mitigate climate change. Repealing these could lead to over 30,000 unnecessary deaths and $275 billion annually.” – Sophie Loeb, Policy Analyst for Center for Progressive Reform

“The EPA doesn’t exist to serve politicians, it exists to protect the public.” Dr. Melissa Booth, Professor, Warren Wilson College

“Climate change is real, the consequences of inaction are severe.” Parker Sloan, Buncombe County Commissioner

“Please do not roll back the policies that help us thrive together.” Rev. Scott Hardin-Nieri

“If the EPA rolls back protections against climate change pollution, then we will have more natural disasters like this.” Jesse Korotitsch, Asheville resident

Join people in fighting back

The science and public sentiment are both crystal clear: climate change is here now, and it’s causing devastating extreme weather events that are harming communities across the country and costing billions of dollars each year. The actions of the Trump administration risk making these extreme weather events more frequent and severe, adding additional pollution to our air and water that will harm public health and make it harder for communities to respond to and rebuild from events like Hurricane Helene.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Helene-Asheville-Hearing.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:27:58.247382

He introduced himself as a fisherman of 50 years to a stranger seated next to him at the banquet table.

“That sounds really hard,” the other man replied.

“Not as hard as it’s going to be to go accept this award and talk to a room full of people,” Yerman said with a laugh. Moments later, his name was called, and he walked onto a professionally lit stage to accept a small crystal trophy from the Oceantic Network, a leading trade group for the burgeoning multibillion-dollar U.S. offshore wind industry.

It was an unlikely sight. U.S. fishermen have long treated wind developers as their sworn enemies.

The conflict started in the early 2000s, when the first plans for New England’s offshore wind areas were sketched out. In packed town hall meetings that often devolved into shouting matches, fishermen claimed the projects would make it harder to earn a living: fewer fishing grounds, fewer fish, damaged ocean habitat.

Few of these predictions have come to pass in places like the United Kingdom, which has already built about 50 offshore wind projects in its waters. Wind areas there are thriving with sharks and serving as a surprising habitat for haddock. But even today, fisher-led groups in the United States are spearheading lawsuits aiming to halt at least two offshore wind projects under construction on the East Coast. One former offshore wind executive told Canary Media that the amount of pushback from fishermen in America has made offshore wind investments riskier than in Europe.

Yerman was one of the first fishermen in the United States to cross this bitter divide. He’s become the reluctant face of a group of about 100 fishermen and fisherwomen who go by the name Sea Services North America. They have decided to work for offshore wind — not against them. Doing so supplements their income from scalloping, a centuries-old bedrock of the New England fishing economy that has seen revenues dry up.

Pursuing work in wind power has come at a cost. After the awards event, back in blue jeans and with a celebratory beer in hand, Yerman recounted the exact word New England fishermen used when he and his crew first crossed the Rubicon.

“They called us traitors,” he said.

Those tensions have become supercharged with the election of President Donald Trump, who has called offshore wind “garbage” and “bullshit” and, in the weeks leading up to his inauguration, pledged that​ “no new windmills” would be built during his presidency. He’s backed up those words with action since taking office, stopping new projects from proceeding and attempting to block some of the country’s eight fully permitted offshore wind projects, too.

Yerman and his crew are left wondering if the industry they’ve bet their livelihood on — and work they’ve risked their reputations for — will all come crashing down.

Many of the fishermen who work through Sea Services voted for Trump. And if the president fulfills his promise to halt the industry, it would be devastating not only for the Northeast’s climate goals and grid reliability — but for thousands of workers in the region, from electricians to welders to Sea Services’ fishers.

One of Sea Services’ captains, Kevin Souza, put it simply: The impact would be “big time.”

“Everyone was skeptical”

Six years ago, Yerman was like the others — angry with offshore wind developers, particularly Danish giant Ørsted, which had set up shop in his hometown of New London, Conn.

Concerned that wind turbines might push his son out of the scalloping business, he pulled one of the only levers he could think to pull and contacted his state senator at the time, Paul Formica, a Republican who owned a local seafood restaurant.

Formica wanted to see the two sides get along. He arranged a meeting between Yerman and an Ørsted executive named Matthew Morrissey, who happened to be a native of New Bedford, Mass., the most lucrative commercial fishing port in America.

Yerman found in Morrissey a sympathetic ear, and in turn, he listened to what the executive had to say — Ørsted was open to partnering with fishermen. Morrissey had seen, with his own eyes, fishers working for and coexisting with Ørsted in a tiny port in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland. The energy firm had a team of about two dozen marine affairs employees, Morrissey relayed, who could help make something like that happen in America if Yerman was on board. He pitched it as a win-win.

“Everyone knows that fishermen hate offshore wind companies. Well, guess what? Offshore wind companies hate fishermen, too,” Morrissey, who no longer works at Ørsted, told Canary Media earlier this year. “Our goal here is to spread the understanding that these two industries can and do and will work together.”

The idea intrigued Yerman. In the United States, profits from scalloping have fluctuated from year to year, and, following a crash in the 1990s, scallop numbers remain unpredictable. In his view, if offshore wind companies were moving into their waters — like it or not — they might as well make some money from it.

Yerman got to work.

His first call was to Gordon Videll, a longtime friend and affable small-town lawyer, who knew things about contracts that Yerman didn’t. The two flew to Kilkeel — on their own dime — to see the model for themselves. Videll noticed that some of Kilkeel’s fishermen were driving cars nicer than his. He and Yerman were inspired.

When they returned to Connecticut, Yerman recruited about a half-dozen of his commercial fishing buddies, and Videll started putting together the paperwork. They dubbed themselves Sea Services North America and in 2020 landed their first small contract, with Ørsted. It was a pilot, said Morrissey, to see if this arrangement would work here in America.

“Everyone was skeptical,” recalled Morrissey with a laugh. “Because their boats were in such poor safety condition. But you know what? They pulled it off.”

Today, Sea Services operates like a co-op and has brought 22 fishing boats up to certified safety standards. With Videll at the helm as part-time CEO, the group has completed about a dozen contracts in eight different offshore wind areas, from Massachusetts to New Jersey. Instead of hiring ferries or work boats, developers rely on Sea Services fishermen to provide safety and scout services for offshore wind vessels.

It’s important work: making sure, for example, no fishing gear, like crab traps, is in the way of cables, monopiles, or survey operations. If necessary, Sea Services fishermen move gear — with the owner’s approval. When not cleared, these obstacles have caused days and sometimes weeks of costly delays for developers, according to Morrissey.

Sea Services was an “indispensable partner” in helping to build South Fork Wind, which went online last year and became America’s first large-scale offshore wind project, wrote Ed LeBlanc, a current Ørsted executive, in an email to Canary Media. The firm has since contracted the group for other projects, in no small part because of their expertise about local waters, he added.

Cooperation between these two sides — offshore wind and commercial fishing — does exist elsewhere in America. For example, Avangrid and Vineyard Offshore, the co-developers of the Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, have paid out $8 million directly to local fishermen unaffiliated with Sea Services for similar safety jobs over the past two years.

But Sea Services is unique. Today the group offers an expansive network of 22 partner vessels based in six states and is led by a commercial fisherman. Videll brought on new technology, allowing developers to track their work in real time. He said they adopted a co-op model to maximize the amount of money going into participants’ pockets.

Receiving the Oceantic Network award in late April was a big deal for the collective, said Videll. It’s an example of how successful the venture has been in a short period of time — and, more importantly, it should be good for business. Industry awards mean visibility. More visibility could mean more Sea Services contracts.

But, right now, the Sea Services business faces headwinds that no award can help overcome.

Since taking office in January, President Trump has launched an all-out assault on the offshore wind industry. On his first day in office, he halted new lease and permitting activity and called for a review of the nine projects that already had their federal permits in hand. In March, his Environmental Protection Agency chief revoked a key permit for Atlantic Shores, a fully permitted project that has since been called off in part due to roadblocks created by the administration.

The most eyebrow-raising step came in April, when Trump’s Interior Department issued a stop-work order for Empire Wind 1, two weeks after the project had begun at-sea construction.

It was a wake-up call for Sea Services, which works for Norwegian energy giant Equinor on the project. Videll, Sea Services’ CEO, said at the time that the cessation of Empire Wind would be a crushing blow that could cost the co-op a total of $9 million to $12 million worth of work.

In May, the administration suddenly lifted the stop-work order. Sea Services’ contract was safe, at least for the time being. But it was the most bracing illustration yet that the business, in spite of all its success, now faces very choppy waters under the Trump administration.

Taking a risk

On a cloudless late-February day at the New Bedford port, 57-year-old Souza hovered over a checklist and laptop in the captain’s quarters of the Pamela Ann. Souza is the captain of the boat, and he needed to make sure everything was in order before he and his crew left New Bedford that afternoon. They would be at sea for 10 days, working in many of the spots Souza had fished in for decades.

Those 10 days at sea would not be spent dredging up scallops from the seafloor and tallying their catch, however, but conducting safety operations for the Revolution Wind offshore wind project, which is being built off the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

The hulking scalloping boat, with its ebony-painted hull and wood-paneled interior, was bustling ahead of the journey. In the galley, Souza’s 25-year-old son, one of the three mates onboard, sorted through the food they’d need. Jack Morris, a 73-year-old scalloper and Sea Services manager, paced around the Pamela Ann checking in on its recently updated safety assets, such as the new tracking beacon and safety suits.

Trips like these have become a lifeline for Souza, his crew, and an increasing number of fishermen who depend on the struggling scalloping industry.

Today, there are roughly 350 vessels sitting in ports from Maine to North Carolina that have licenses to harvest sea scallops. For several decades, East Coast scallopers managed to eke out a comfortable middle-class lifestyle on scalloping alone. Morris said that “years ago” he’d pull in $200,000 to $300,000 of profit annually as a scallop boat captain.

“Yeah, those days are gone,” Morris scoffed.

While the price of scallops remains high, making it one of the most lucrative U.S. fisheries, rules passed over the past 30 years have restricted when and where scallopers can harvest, resulting in fewer days at sea, fewer scallops caught — and less money for the entire industry.

Souza has mixed emotions about the regulations.

On the one hand, scallops are no longer being overfished. A 2024 third-party audit of the fishery said it “meets the requirements for a well-managed and sustainable fishery.” In fact, for more than a decade, U.S. sea scallops sold on grocery store shelves have carried a little blue-check label — the mark of a seafood certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.

But most scallop fishermen are now limited to an extremely short window of time during which they can harvest scallops — this year, it was just 24 days. Some of their favorite fishing grounds are regularly closed for scallop recovery. There are simply fewer scallops to go around. Souza estimates that captains who stick to scalloping alone are making half of what they did in years past.

“They’re probably lucky to make a hundred [thousand],” he said.

Offshore wind work has helped fishermen like Souza and Morris ease the sting of that lost income.

Across Revolution Wind’s two-year construction window, Souza expects to make more than $200,000 as a part-time boat captain. For the younger generation, who Souza said as deckhands can expect to make only around $30,000 per year from scalloping, offshore wind work makes it possible to keep earning a middle-class wage.

In the past year, Souza has recruited to Sea Services both of his sons, his nephew, and a few other young folks from longtime fishing families who might have otherwise left the scallop industry if not for the supplemental income.

“This wind farm business is the number one way for scallop guys, captains, mates, deckhands, to make extra money,” Morris said.

It’s also helping to revitalize the port of New Bedford, a city of 100,000 that is not only the most valuable fishing port in America but also a place of tremendous historic importance to the industry. It was once the epicenter of the whaling world and serves as the backdrop for the opening scenes of Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick.”

In just 10 years, the offshore wind industry has ushered in a transformation the city hadn’t seen “since the whaling era,” according to Jon Mitchell, the city’s mayor since 2011.

The companies building Vineyard Wind now stage their offshore wind infrastructure in New Bedford. Their presence has brought a flood of public and private funding to the city, with some $1.2 billion already invested and pledged to help give the terminals, docks, and harbor a facelift, according to Mitchell.

For all the money offshore wind has brought to the city — and into the pockets of locals like Souza and Morris — offshore wind remains highly controversial among many commercial fishermen in New Bedford.

That’s in spite of Mitchell’s insistence that, when push comes to shove, New Bedford’s local government will always side with scalloping.

Still, Mitchell, one of New England’s fiercest offshore wind defenders, remains unpopular with many at the docks. “I’ve put myself in the loneliest place in American politics, which is right in the middle. Between offshore wind and commercial fishing,” he said.

Trump flags, full pockets

The fishermen who take part in Sea Services also float in that lonely place.

It’s not uncommon for them to face harassment from other fishermen over the radio when out on the water, Yerman said. One time, he said a Sea Services fisherman was turned away from a Rhode Island dock, in what Yerman characterized as an act of revenge.

The hardest part of Yerman’s job is overcoming this cultural aversion and getting fishermen to the table, convincing them that working for offshore wind developers is a way to sustain a livelihood whose viability has begun to fade.

“You’ll have the lobster guys and they’ll say shit to you — like, ‘traitor.’ Or ‘Trump’s gonna shut that down, ha ha ha,’” said Souza, imitating the taunts he receives over the marine radio bolted to the wall near the helm of the Pamela Ann.

The lobstermen have a point regarding Trump. As frustrating as their remarks may be, the biggest threat to offshore wind is not snipes from colleagues, but the actions of a president who many Sea Services members, including Souza, voted for.

As Souza prepared to leave the New Bedford port in February to go help Ørsted build giant wind turbines in the ocean, something Trump swore would not happen during his term, he explained his support for the president.

“Trust me, I want Trump to ‘drill, drill, drill.’ I’m all for it,” said Souza of the president’s plans to expand oil and gas production.

But he still thinks offshore wind is necessary to get more power onto New England’s grid and lower energy costs. Experts say the federal permitting process for offshore wind in America takes too long — about four years.

But, in the Northeast, according to energy analyst Christian Roselund, finishing the deployment of the offshore wind projects already in the permitting pipeline will be much faster than starting up new nuclear or fossil-gas power plants.

Most of the fishermen in New Bedford are Trump supporters, Souza insisted. Morris, who also voted for Trump, agreed. Overall, Trump won 46% of the city’s votes in last November’s election — a much higher proportion than his Massachusetts statewide total of 36.5%. The “TRUMP 2024” flags flown from the dozens of scallop boats docked across New Bedford’s port underscored the point. A few of those Trump flag-flying boats even work for the offshore wind companies, Morris claimed. The Pamela Ann, for its part, does not have a Trump flag.

“I support Trump even though I know he’s against wind. … I believe this will still be around,” said Souza, gesturing toward the ocean, where somewhere over the horizon an array of wind towers was being erected. “He’s gonna see the light.”

Trump, of course, has not seen the light — though he did revoke his stop-work order against Empire Wind.

After being grounded for a month, Sea Services fishermen began operations on Empire Wind again in early June, when the project resumed at-sea work. The co-op’s members are helping Equinor’s construction vessels lay boulders on the seafloor to stabilize all 54 wind towers that will be raised over the next two years and eventually supply renewable energy to New York City.

But nothing is certain. When the Trump administration unpaused the project, it left open the door to stopping it again — or killing it altogether. A May letter from the Interior Department to Equinor noted that it is still conducting an “ongoing review” to determine if the project’s permits were “rushed” and therefore illegitimate in the eyes of the Trump administration.

Meanwhile, a coalition of a dozen fishing companies and several anti-offshore wind groups typically allied with Trump sued the administration June 3, just days before Empire Wind restarted at-sea construction, in an attempt to reinstate the stop-work order. The move came weeks after wind opponents asked Trump to also pause Revolution Wind, one of the more lucrative contracts Sea Services holds.

In his opposition to offshore wind, Trump has positioned himself as a defender of the commercial fishing industry, claiming falsely at a May 2024 campaign rally in Wildwood, N.J., for example, that the turbines “cause tremendous problems with the fish and the whales.”

But for the increasing number of fishermen working with offshore wind companies, halting the industry would not help — it would cut a financial lifeline.

Not long ago, in 2017, Sea Services captain Rodney Avila remembered being one of the only fishers in New Bedford willing to seize this lifeline. He recalled with a laugh what a longtime fisherman friend said to him then: “When you put that first wind turbine up there … we’re going to hang you from it!”

Times have changed. In the New Bedford area, almost 50 local fishing vessels have performed some kind of safety or scouting work for Vineyard Wind. At least one captain lowers his MAGA-supporting flag before setting out to work on the projects the president has sworn to stop, according to Avila. He said politics has always been tangled up in fishing. And work is work.

“They don’t care whether it’s red, or blue, or whatever color. … They don’t care,” Avila shrugged, while sipping coffee inside a Dunkin’. Five scalloping boats bobbed on calm water just beyond the parking lot. “It’s money that they need to support their families, wherever it comes from.”

Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand. Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.

Separately, Wall Street is growing concerned over the loss of EV tax credits and regulatory credits stemming from Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Over the weekend, Musk polled users on X about whether he should start an independent party called the America Party to challenge the government's status quo. Musk continued his complaints that Trump's bill would do nothing to rein in the deficit and offers little in terms of benefits to the American people.

""By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!"" Musk said. ""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""

Tesla stock slipped over 7% in Monday trading.

Trump and Musk supporters hoped a recent detente would settle the matter, but it erupted again with Musk's latest foray.

""I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely 'off the rails,' essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,"" Trump responded in a Truth Social post. ""He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States - The System seems not designed for them.""

Musk's past strong critiques of the bill led to a massive falling out with Trump, with Tesla and Musk's other businesses like SpaceX caught in the crosshairs.

The battle between the two was too much for even Tesla bulls and investors to bear, who saw the stock pummelled a few weeks back before recovering.

""Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote. ""After leaving the Trump Administration and DOGE there was initial relief from Tesla shareholders and big supporters ... That relief lasted a very short time and now has taken a turn for the worst with this latest announcement.""

As if the political battles weren't enough, Trump also responded to a feature of the bill Musk privately groused over.

Danbury-based FuelCell Energy Inc. President Jason Few said Monday morning that the budget bill offers direct support for the industry, including reinstating the Investment Tax Credit, which makes fuel cell property eligible for a flat 30% tax credit.

The credit was phased out at the end of 2024.

“The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ is a landmark for American energy leadership — and it’s time to set the record straight: clean energy was not sidelined,” Few said. “In fact, the bill includes direct, powerful provisions that support the fuel cell industry and reinforce the United States’ position as a global leader in data center infrastructure and grid resilience.”

The bill has been criticized by environmentalists because it eliminates tax credits and incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act for wind, solar and electric vehicles.

Few also stressed the importance of preserving the transferability of federal tax credits, calling it “very important — especially for small- and mid-sized companies — to maintain the ability to monetize these credits.”

FuelCell Energy also said it supports Congress’ decision to modify hydrogen provisions in the bill, “ensuring stability for companies that have already made significant investments in hydrogen.”

The bill extends the deadline for companies to obtain the Section 45V clean hydrogen production credit from Dec. 31, 2025, to Jan. 1, 2028, giving them more time to initiate projects.

“We recognize that many companies have made significant investments in hydrogen,” Few said. “Congress made the right call in ensuring that those investments are not undermined by sudden policy shifts.

Loren Duggan Well, the Senate is going to spend this week processing some nominations, which they’ve done all throughout the year, but certainly that might pick up the pace as they put this bill in the rearview mirror. Two of the big ones this week, one is the head of the [Federal Aviation Administration], obviously always a big job, but top of mind is aviation safety issues with what happened over the Potomac River earlier this year and elsewhere around the country. So the confirmation of that is set up for this week and then also for the new head of the Office of Personnel Management. And with everything going on in the federal government with federal workers, this could be closely watched as well. No indication either of those are in trouble and they only need 50 votes to get them through. So we’ll likely see them processed this week, but interesting ones to watch for sure.

Terry Gerton There certainly should be at least a few hard questions in the course of those hearings.

Loren Duggan Yeah, there were, but they’ve gotten through the committee process and now they’re reaching the floor where there’s not much chance for questioning there. It’s more of an up or down question when it gets there. And we’ll see how quickly they can process those.

Terry Gerton Well, and then they’ve also got the rescissions package, $9.4 billion of money that’s not going to be spent.

Loren Duggan That’s right. So that’s kind of in the queue here, but with a deadline of July 18th, because of the timing of the request. So around June 3rd, the administration set up a request to rescind or cancel $9.4 billion in previous year money. Most of it was under the State Department, USAID, and then a little bit — about a billion or so — under the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, so to help fund NPR, PBS. The House passed a package that basically signed off on those cuts. The Senate has been a little cooler and waiting. They had a hearing with Russ Vought before the holiday week. And they’ve said they might want to tinker with it, especially things dealing with [the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)] or some of those public broadcasting things. So I wouldn’t say it’s a done deal in the Senate. There are chances for maybe some changes, but there is this clock ticking on that bill, just given the way that process has to work.

Terry Gerton And if the Senate makes changes, does it have to go back to the House and they have to come to a vote on it again?

Loren Duggan Exactly. So if they were to cancel some of the cancelations, if you will, then the House would have to sign off on those as well. And there’s really speed here to get it done within those 45 days. Otherwise, the administration is supposed to release the funds under the process that they’re doing this under.

Terry Gerton Well, that will be interesting to watch. There is some other legislation moving forward: The House is dealing with crypto regulations.

Loren Duggan That’s right. So a couple of weeks ago, we saw the Senate pass a bill called the GENIUS Act, which is about regulating stable coins, one type of crypto. And then the House has also been working on something called the CLARITY Act, which would provide broader regulatory structure for Bitcoin and other types of cryptocurrency. So these two different proposals moving through. There’s been some talk about one vote that would set up both of those things to move forward. The House bill on CLARITY would go over to the Senate and the Senate bill might be able to be signed off and sent to Trump, but there’s a lot of interest in this subject. I think it’s like one of the sleeper issues that’s been moving, but moves more to the fore now that some of the bigger things are out of the way. So not exactly sure how soon they’ll vote on that, but that is a priority and something where a lot backers have put a lot money into American politics, certainly in recent years. So it’ll be interesting to see how that plays out.

Terry Gerton Exactly. I’m speaking with Loren Duggan. He’s the deputy news director of Bloomberg Government. Well, one of the perennial topics that you and I cover is where we are on budget discussions. So the House is still doing markups. What are you seeing in terms of the 2026 budget bills that are moving through?

Loren Duggan Kind of a slow churn; the House had some markups, got some bills through, they’re going to resume those and try to make progress to do as many as they can before they leave at the end of this month. The Senate hasn’t done them yet. They have plans to get to those bills and mark up some as well. And we’ll see what the prospects for floor action are for a lot of those in either chamber; [it] takes a lot of time. But certainly they want to lay down markers for later discussions on this. And obviously the big date here is September 30th and what they can get done before then and what may need to do to keep the government operating while they continue talking. But that’s been a slow roll process in part because they didn’t have everything from the administration they wanted to formulate these bills either.

Terry Gerton Well, that’s an interesting point because as we watched the reconciliation bill go through, we were noticing that there were big chunks of money for some of the big agencies — [the departments of Defense and Homeland Security] — for 2026 that then are separate from their baseline budgets that have been submitted for the budget committees to review and mark up. Do you have a sense of how Congress is thinking about that? What does it mean for the baseline? What does it mean for agencies going forward? It just reminds me of the old days of the overseas contingency budgets in DoD when we were engaged in activities in the Middle East.

Loren Duggan Yeah, I think it’s different because I think these are going to be base things all over the country rather than focus on overseas, like those OCO funds. But the administration, when it put out its budget request, the skinny one even contemplated this reconciliation funding being part of the overall picture to get closer to that trillion dollar amount of money they wanted for DoD. Some of the documents we’ve seen from DoD too have two columns. They have the regular discretionary debate and this reconciliation debate, and then a total. So I think it’s going to be a challenge as we watch this money, because some of it will be baked in with reconciliation potentially moving through. And then we’ll have this debate around the regular DoD budget as part of the appropriations process. So it might be hard to keep track or add up. I think a lot of people have some spreadsheets on their desk and doing a little math to keep track of where the money’s going to go, because there will be these two distinct streams that produce a total budget in the end.

Terry Gerton It’ll be really interesting to watch and then to see what happens. I mean, it’s super early to talk about 2027, but what will that baseline be? Will it be the base budget, the base plus reconciliation, parts, some, none, all? I don’t know.

Loren Duggan Exactly. And that’s a real concern because if you take out the reconciliation burst of money, which can be spent for multiple years, like a lot of money. But then you’re going to have a decline. And I don’t think that’s the message that a lot of Republicans are going to want to send. So it will be interesting looking at these debates as they move forward, both in the appropriation side and the armed services committees, which are starting to mark up their defense policy bills. We’ll see where those go as well. But they’ll wrestle with that. They helped write the reconciliation portion in the [House and Senate Armed Services Committees (HASC and SASC)] if you will. So they’ll be counting for that as well as they write the policy bills as soon as this week in the Senate.

Terry Gerton They’ll be busy for the month of July in hopes that they get their normal August recess, I suppose. What else do you think is on the top of their to-do list for the rest of July?

Loren Duggan I think they’ll start clearing out some bills they haven’t had the chance to do, appropriations bills for sure. And then the House is looking at some energy and infrastructure bills, things like water permitting and making that faster, things like cross-border energy projects. So there’s a bunch of pent up legislating that they haven’t really done while everyone’s been focused on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, if you will. So there’s a lot of smaller bills and those will be moving and making their way through the legislative process.

Terry Gerton Maybe back to regular order on those.

Loren Duggan Perhaps. We’ll see. At some point the regular order is what it is and maybe we do things a new way than we did 25 years ago, but certainly, the trends change is how they take these things up.",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Congress_Tax_Cuts_79955-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:26:57.821837

Now that the One Big Beautiful Bill has been signed into law, the elimination of clean energy tax credits will cause a nation of higher energy bills – even for consumers and states that aren’t using clean energy.

Despite the “Day One” Declaration of an Energy Emergency, Congress just passed a bill that will do the opposite of addressing the real needs that the U.S. has to meet energy demand and decrease electricity costs for consumers. The bill will make it harder to connect the cheapest forms of power available to the grid, solar and wind. It also takes away the existing incentives to speed up the production of clean power.

Do you want more energy on the grid faster? To provide reliable power to your homes during storms or to support the buildout of AI data centers? The Clean Energy Investment and Production Tax Credits (45Y, 48E, and 45X), a technology-neutral tax credit, made this possible by subsidizing the production of zero-emission sources like solar, wind, nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal – not dissimilar to the subsidies fossil fuels receive like 45I. This helped with the upfront cost of these projects, and since these sources of energy are cheaper than fossil fuels, they lowered consumer energy bills and increased grid reliability by providing more clean energy, quicker. Surprise, surprise, they have been eliminated, meaning the types of projects that are going to move forward will be coal and natural gas, which are more expensive. Oil and gas won big, especially since the OBBB established accelerated National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews for oil and gas projects in exchange for a fee of up to 125% of project costs and by prioritizing fossil fuel development on public lands.

Say Goodbye to All of This

Are you a homeowner whose house is too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter? The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C) made it possible for you to receive $1,200 to weatherize or insulate your home, making it safer and more comfortable during extreme temperatures while lowering your energy bills. This is now eliminated, making it more expensive and less feasible to make these types of home improvements.

Do you have an interest in installing solar panels or a geothermal system to one day achieve a $0 electricity bill? The Residential Clean Energy Credit (25D), made this a reality by providing a 30% tax credit for rooftop solar, wind power, geothermal heating systems, and battery systems. This is now eliminated, making it more expensive to purchase renewable systems for your home and reducing consumer choice. This tax credit also created jobs in the residential renewables industry, so you can expect to see some significant job losses as a result.

Do you own an EV or hope to own one someday to save money on gas and to lower carbon emissions? The Electric Vehicle Credits (45W, 30D, 30C, 25E) made this possible by allowing up to $7,500 for a new EV purchase, and up to $4,000 for the purchase of a used EV. These tax credits also provided a boost to the automotive industry and created thousands of jobs. Now that these credits are being eliminated, buying an EV just got more expensive and job losses and business closures are bound to happen.

The bottom line? Energy prices will go up, the job market will suffer as will clean energy investment, especially in red districts – since a total of 60% of this spending has gone to Republican-held suburban and rural districts across the U.S.

The true breadth and severity of these eliminations will reveal themselves sooner than you think.",https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/50166918308_d861966777_c.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:25:51.800900

In 2024, the company recorded total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions of more than 2.1 million tCO₂e and continues to address upstream Scope 3 emissions through supply chain reform.

Hyundai signed major renewable power agreements in Korea, India and the United States to accelerate its transition to RE100, with a target of 100% renewable electricity across all sites by 2045.

Its water stewardship strategy includes zero liquid discharge systems and rainwater harvesting, particularly in high-risk regions such as India – helping avoid production disruption while reducing reliance on external water sources.

Electrification and clean mobility

Electrification is at the heart of Hyundai’s transition strategy.

In 2024, the company sold 218,504 EVs and plans to deliver two million annually by 2030, supported by a rollout of 21 EV models and expanded production in North America, Europe and Asia.

Alongside battery innovation and modular design, Hyundai is scaling up fuel cell and extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) platforms to ensure flexibility amid shifting regulatory landscapes.

Its Singapore and Georgia plants showcase smart manufacturing powered by renewables and digital systems, supporting global capacity growth and carbon savings.

Green manufacturing and efficiency

Energy efficiency measures include the introduction of low-temperature paint curing technology that reduces energy consumption by up to 40%.

At its Asan plant, Hyundai saved US$1.06bn annually and cut carbon emissions by more than 2,450 tonnes through this innovation.

The company’s use of AI-based systems, digital twin technology and predictive energy management reflects its move toward intelligent, low-carbon manufacturing ecosystems.

“At the heart of Hyundai’s vision is our commitment to sustainability,” says José Muñoz, President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company.

“Our Sustainability Report provides a snapshot of our performance in categories critical to our governance and to future generations.

“We’re working diligently to reduce the environmental impact of our vehicles and manufacturing processes throughout their lifecycle.

“Our commitment to achieving 100% renewable energy (RE100) across our businesses is taking shape through large-scale renewable energy purchase agreements in Korea, the US and India.

“We’re also maximising water recycling and working toward our ultimate goal of carbon neutrality by 2045.”

Social sustainability

Social sustainability is embedded in Hyundai’s HR, health and supply chain practices.

Globally, the company aims to reach 27% representation of women in management outside Korea by 2030, while in Korea it is targeting 15%.

Hyundai has also committed to hiring more than 450 individuals with disabilities by 2027 and expanding diversity training across all sites to promote equity and inclusion.

Human rights

Hyundai conducted ESG risk assessments on 1,120 overseas suppliers, introduced forced labour risk screening and updated procurement codes to align with international laws, including the US Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act and the EU Forced Labour Regulation.

Human rights training and audit programmes were expanded across 74 global sites, supported by grievance mechanisms, site-specific risk mapping and regular follow-up on corrective actions.

Health and safety

Health and safety are actively governed at board level, with key metrics integrated into site-specific KPIs.

In 2024, Hyundai delivered more than 106,000 hours of environmental and safety training to more than 67,000 employees.

Risk monitoring systems, including digital dashboards and safety sensors, are being deployed to detect incidents early and reinforce site preparedness.

Governance and ethics

In governance, Hyundai strengthened its board structure by introducing a lead independent director and increasing female representation to 33%.

ESG performance is now embedded into executive KPIs, and all sustainability policies are overseen by the board-level Sustainability Management Committee.

Independent committees for ethics, audits and remuneration provide further checks and accountability.

A newly established Business Risk Management Group reports directly to the CEO, tracking threats across supply chains, geopolitics and climate regulation.

Hyundai’s governance framework ensures real-time monitoring and integrates ESG risks into long-term planning, especially as global expectations around transparency, due diligence and emissions disclosures continue to rise.

Stakeholder engagement

Communication and collaboration

Hyundai continues to engage with a wide range of stakeholders through structured channels for employees, dealers, suppliers, investors, governments and communities.

Communication platforms such as the Win-Win Growth Portal and HMG Partner System foster transparency and mutual development.

Investors are especially concerned with Hyundai’s net-zero roadmap, progress on RE100, and ability to mitigate risks linked to EV production and supply chain ethics.

The company has also recently delivered electric buses to Tanegashima Yakushima Kotsu, a regional transportation and tourism service provider operated by the Iwasaki Group in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan.

The initiative marks a significant step in transitioning to zero-emission public transport on Yakushima Island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

""I am delighted to see Hyundai's ELEC City electric buses running here on Yakushima, contributing towards a cleaner island environment,"" says Jaehoon Chang, Hyundai Motor Group Vice Chair.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/73373936b1352e4c5bccc29e6ed548e6:93bc3bf4770103979de0174ca3d179c2/hyundai-min.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 15:17:34.161880

But electric cars, the shift to software-defined vehicles and the rise of China's auto sector have thrown all of that into chaos.

30%: The EV Race In America Won't Suffer Fools Anymore

Now that the U.S. is backing off on tougher fuel economy standards and pulling the EV tax credits, buying or leasing one is due to get more expensive. And the overall market is expected to slow down in the coming years. But this trend will coincide with China, Europe and other regions accelerating EV adoption. Even President Donald Trump seems bullish on hybrid cars, which are selling in droves at the moment.

The point is this: any automaker that wants to compete globally can't back off on electrification. While some may breathe a sigh of relief and assume America's EV reversal means a return to gas power—you know, the kind of entrenched stuff they know how to do because they've always done it—that isn't in step with the technological progress.

This is all to say that even if automakers slow down their EV rollouts now, they have no choice but to keep investing and developing cheaper, better electric products that can compete on their own merits without tax breaks.

To be clear, this isn't an argument for ending the incentives; that's a highly disruptive move that's sending shockwaves through the industry. But it is the reality on the ground. This is America, and in America, you go it alone.

I was inspired to write this take after reading a LinkedIn post from Christopher Harto, who is Consumer Reports' Senior Transportation and Policy Analyst, and one of our most-quoted experts in the space.

""The challenge for automakers that understand that electric is the future will be to deliver a compelling and polished product at a price that's much closer to the price of competing gas-powered vehicles,"" Harto wrote. ""Automakers that hit this mark are likely to find a very enthusiastic customer base. Those that miss this mark will continue to struggle with vehicles languishing on lots and angry dealers.

He predicts that the U.S. electric market will continue to grow, albeit more slowly, then really pick up in the next two to five years—much of what the industry was already expecting. And by then, these companies had better be ready to compete. ""The real competition starts now. There will be no more participation trophies,"" Harto said.

We're not big on those in America, either.

So, where do automakers go from here? We intend to find out soon enough. Toyota was once the king of EV participation trophies, but even it seems to be getting better at this. Honda, which re-skins a General Motors car for its sole EV in America, didn't miss a beat to back off on its future plans. I doubt Hyundai and Kia will do the same. Rivian has a tough year ahead, but also a huge lifeline from Volkswagen and a promising future lineup. And GM and Ford are now in a big battery technology race that neither can afford to abandon.

The future is already here. Now we're going to see who's serious about meeting it.

60%: Xiaomi Did What Apple Couldn't

China's Xiaomi YU7 and SU7 really do seem to be what the Apple Car could've been: high-tech, electric and deeply connected to all your other Xiaomi devices. Heck, these two even support Apple CarPlay.

Xiaomi chairman and founder Lei Jun even made sure to draw comparisons to the Apple Car at the YU7's debut event two weeks ago. And today, Bloomberg has a look at what went right with Xiaomi that went well wrong with Apple:

The collapse of Apple’s moonshot car program has only underscored the effectiveness of Xiaomi’s grounded approach, which took inspiration from proven designs from Tesla Inc. and Porsche Automobil Holding SE while staying true to the affordable ethos that’s made it a cult brand for Gen Z consumers.

Crucially, it also launched into the most fertile EV ecosystem in the world — China. With state subsidies, existing charging infrastructure and a ready-made supply chain, Xiaomi had a structural tailwind Apple lacked.

Apple’s car project, internally dubbed Project Titan, failed in large part because it wasn’t just an EV — it was at one point an attempt to leapfrog the auto industry with a fully autonomous, Level 5 self-driving machine. Its goals were lofty and the direction constantly shifting, the result being over a decade of effort with nothing to show. Lei, 55, was comparatively stingy with time and resources and staked his personal reputation on the endeavor, claiming that making cars would be his “last entrepreneurial project.”

Oh, and Xiaomi poached the heck out of China's existing auto industry talent, namely the Geely Group, the owner of Volvo and Polestar:

Xiaomi headhunters also courted Geely staff intensely, according to people familiar with the matter. While it’s common for talent to move between companies in the same industry, it was unusual to see this level of aggressiveness around recruitment, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing information that’s private. Geely didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Besides assembling top Chinese automaking talent, Lei made a prescient bet on investing in a self-controlled supply chain — insulating Xiaomi’s operation from manufacturing vagaries. This came from painful lessons learned in Xiaomi’s early smartphone-producing days, when external suppliers would cut off components unpredictably.

Xiaomi said it plans to start exporting cars out of China in 2027, and my guess is that Europe is up first. Does any car company want to slow down when this is what they're up against?

90%: Elon Musk Can't Quit Politics, Even If He Should

Tesla Trump Musk Stock

Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has gone from being Trump's ""First Buddy"" to being vaguely threatened with deportation. Many Musk-watchers didn't think that partnership would last forever, but few could've anticipated how violently it would explode.

Musk opposed Trump's Big Beautiful Bill on the grounds that it will hurt clean energy subsidies while increasing the national debt, and in response, he says he's making his own political party: the America Party.

Why does this matter for the EV world? Because pretty much everyone involved wishes he wouldn't, reports CNBC:

Now the tech billionaire’s reinvolvement in the political arena is making investors nervous.

“Very simply, Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note Sunday.

“While the core Musk supporters will back Musk at every turn no matter what, there is broader sense of exhaustion from many Tesla investors that Musk keeps heading down the political track,” he wrote.

Musk’s previous political foray earned him Trump’s praise in the early days, but he has since drawn the ire of the U.S. president.

Tesla's stock was down about 7% this morning. And it's understandable: it's awfully hard to parse what good has come from Musk's foray into politics, besides perhaps pushing for a unified autonomous vehicle regulation standard. It's probably best if he could just stick to cars moving forward.

Apalachicola is a small city in the Florida Panhandle that is home to a thriving seafood industry — primarily oysters — that relies on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico for its living. The Apalachicola River is formed by the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers, which begin in northeast Georgia, then flow south though Georgia into Alabama before crossing into Florida — a total distance of 385 miles.

At one time, Apalachicola was the third busiest port on the Gulf, after New Orleans and Mobile. Prior to the arrival of the railroad, it was served by steamships that carried cargo up and down the river.

Although oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster did not reach all the way to Apalachicola itself, it devastated the local economy. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that spill killed 8.3 billion oysters, 105,00 sea birds, 7,600 adult and 160,000 juvenile sea turtles, and cut the number of dolphins in Louisiana’s Barataria Bay in half.

So when word got out a few years ago that oil and gas companies were interested in drilling exploratory wells near Apalachicola, the locals decided it was time to get organized. Adrianne Johnson, the executive director of the Florida Shellfish Aquaculture Association, which represents more than 350 shellfish farmers in Florida, tells The Guardian her group became involved in an environmental campaign called Kill the Drill.

“This region has a deep collective memory of how the Gulf oil spill devastated the regional economy and collapsed the oyster industry in Apalachicola Bay,” Johnson said. “And that was just the threat of oil. The majority of the state’s oyster farms operate across Wakulla, Franklin and Gulf counties, and these areas downriver would be most impacted by oil drilling upriver at a proposed site in Calhoun county. If there were to be a spill upriver because of drilling in the basin, it would have catastrophic environmental and economic impacts on the area that would be felt for generations.”

“Our shellfish farmers are still recovering from the multiple hurricanes of 2024,” Johnson added. “But the reality of being a Florida farmer is having to contend with these weather-related events. Hurricanes and natural disasters are outside of our control. Permitting oil drilling in ecologically sensitive areas is very much within our control and is an unnecessary threat to our industry.”

State representative Allison Tant agreed. “We are a hurricane-prone state,” she said. “We can’t get away from that. It’s not a question of will we get hit by a hurricane because we know it’s going to happen. But an oil spill caused by a hurricane would make the disaster 100 times worse.”

Opposing Oil & Gas In Apalachicola

In April, 2024, the Florida department of environmental protection granted a permit to Louisiana-based Clearwater Land and Minerals for exploratory oil drilling in the Apalachicola River basin. That promoted area residents, environmental groups, and the business community to create Kill the Drill. Florida representative Jason Shoaf told The Guardian the Deepwater Horizon disaster “harmed our commercial fishing, aquaculture operations, and just the threat of oil kept tourists away for months. Businesses were forced to close, jobs were lost, and the disaster reshaped our region forever.”

A year later, a judge ruled the DEP was in error when it issued the permit to Clearwater and recommended the department deny the permit. Following the judge’s ruling, it did exactly that. But Shoaf and Tant felt the area needed stronger protection.

“While the permit to Clearwater Land and Minerals was denied, we can’t assume the next one will be,” Shoaf told The Guardian. “HB 1143 protects our precious water resources and the ecosystems that depend on them by prohibiting drilling, exploration and production of oil, gas and other petroleum products within 10 miles of a national estuarine research reserve in counties designated as rural areas of opportunity. It also requires the Florida department of environmental protection to ensure natural resources are adequately protected in the event of an accident.”

The measure sailed through the Florida legislature and was signed by Florida’s governor last week. “Oil from the BP spill didn’t reach our coasts, but the damage caused by the threat was enough,” Tant says. “We’ve seen what can happen. We’ve lived it. This is not theoretical. It was a perilous time for small businesses and for those who lived in the area. It stopped tourism and shuttered small businesses. So it defies logic to think it’s a good idea to drill for oil along the Apalachicola River.”

A Balancing Test

According to Florida Politics, HB 1143 requires the DEP to conduct a “balancing test” before granting a permit for oil and gas activities in areas within one mile of the coast or other bodies of water. It needs to consider the urgency of protecting natural resources and weigh that against the potential commercial benefits. It also must consider whether the natural resource would be adequately protected in the event of “an accident or a blowout from oil or gas drilling or exploration activities,” according to the bill analysis.

It would prohibit the “drilling, exploration, or production of oil, gas, or other petroleum products within 10 miles of a National Estuarine Research Reserve,” which means such drilling or resource exploration would be banned near places such as Apalachicola Bay.

Craig Diamond, a past president of Apalachicola Riverkeeper, one of the environmental groups associated with the Kill The Drill initiative, said another factor behind the ban was protecting the Appalachia River itself. “A spill would be highly impactful given the existing stresses in the system. Apalachicola Bay Riverkeeper and its allies believe the long term risks of fossil fuel exploitation in the flood plain or bay far outweigh the short term benefits.”

He is no doubt correct, but there may be more to the story. Ron DeSantis has a poor track record on environmental issues and the Florida Panhandle is deeply red territory and home to such rabid political actors as Matt Gaetz. One could almost guess Clearwater Land & Minerals was just not that invested in developing oil and gas assets in the area.

It wouldn’t be a total surprise if it has its eye on some other project in the Gulf, one that won’t create quite so much community opposition. Florida politics is a mine field. We may never know the full story, but we do know that one little corner of the Gulf is now protected from oil and gas exploration.

Page Two — The Rest Of The Story

There is a coda to this story. Few people know that in 1849, Apalachicola physician John Gorrie discovered the cold air process of refrigeration as part of his experiments in how lower the body temperature of fever patients. He patented his ice machine in 1850 and that patent led to the development of modern refrigeration and air conditioning, The John Gorrie Memorial Bridge on US Route 98 is named for him.

Right near the bridge on the east side of the river stands the Gibson Inn, a stately structure that resembles the superstructure of one of the steamboats that once plied the Apalachicola River. Every room is appointed differently and if you arrive when they are not too busy, the staff will invite you to explore them all at your leisure and select the one that appeals to you the most.

After dinner in the main dining room, you can stroll the wide verandas of the building and pretend you are cruising the river. You may even imagine you can hear the sound of the paddle wheel as you go upstream. All that is missing is the steam whistle located up there in the pilot house located on top of the structure. Listen carefully and you may hear the leadsman in the bow shout “Mark twain!” Now, thanks to a bit of local activism, the character of this waterfront community will be preserved a little longer",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kill-The-Drill.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:28:10.370108

In one of Trump’s first executive orders, he eliminated a centralized system that Jimmy Carter initially set up to issue regulations governing environmental impact statements. Instead, he called on each agency to issue its own regulations, which seems to have caused the predictable amount of confusion. I’ve examined the new regulations from three agencies: the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Energy (DOE) , and the Department of Transportation (DOT), which happened to be the first ones that I saw. There seems to be little rhyme or reason in the variations.

Variations involving other agencies may be even greater. According to EarthJustice, some agencies have adopted new regulations while others have opted for non-binding guidelines.

Shortchanging the Environment

When he told agencies to make their own regulations, Trump also made it clear that environmental considerations were to play little role. Instead, he said, “agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives” to the extent allowed by law. This section of the order is entitled “Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting,” with “energy dominance” being Trump’s phrase for dramatically expanding fossil fuels.

Agencies got the message in the sense that none of the regulations I examined cites the policies that Congress articulated in NEPA or show any concern about potentially overlooking important environmental impacts.

One area of commonality involves the definition of effects. All three Departments say:

“Effects should generally not be considered if they are remote in time, geographically remote, or the product of a lengthy causal chain. Effects do not include those effects that the agency has no ability to prevent due to the limits of its regulatory authority, or that would occur regardless of the proposed action, or that would need to be initiated by a third party.”

This language seems designed to exclude consideration of impacts on climate change and other systemic environmental risks.

Reducing Public Participation

All three regulations seem to provide less scope for public content than prior regulations. They all do require an opportunity an opportunity to comment early in the process of issuing an environmental impact statement, as required by the statute, but whether there will be any further opportunity to public input varies. There are also variations in what opportunity for public input, if any, exists in the preparation of a more streamlined document, an environmental assessment:

DOD requires further public input at some point after the initial notice during the preparation of an impact statement, but not necessarily the opportunity to comment on the draft impact statement. It doesn’t mention public comment for an environmental assessment.

DOE makes public comment after the initial scoping announcement optional. Public input into the preparation of an environmental assessment is also optional.

DOT calls for as much public input into preparation of an environmental assessment as “practicable,” but not necessarily an opportunity to comment on or even see a draft of the document. DOT makes disclosure and comment on a draft impact statement discretionary except when required by a statute other than NEPA, which appears to be true for some sub-agencies within DOT.

Notably, CEQ has approved a plan to keep draft environmental impact statements for fossil fuel projects secret to streamline the process in light of Trump’s purported “energy emergency.”

Discordant Regulations

I had thought the agencies might all issue nearly identical regulation written by the White House. That doesn’t seem to have happened. There are certainly a lot of commonalities, but there are also significant differences, not limited to issues like public notice. Here are some other examples:

DOE has the most elaborate rules governing environmental reviews produced by project applicants; DOD’s are sketchy; DOT punts the issue to its various subagencies.

DOE defines “mitigation” briefly in its definition section; DOD does not define it; DOT has an elaborate definition.

The DOE, DOD, and DOT emergency provisions were all different, with DOE’s being the vaguest, but none of them referenced national emergency declarations.

The differences between agencies may be random, or they may reflect different attitudes toward NEPA. Regardless, they could prove troublesome for the government. Project opponents may be able to score points in court by showing that other agencies would have done things differently. More importantly, the differences between rules will cause problems when two agencies have jurisdiction over the same project but different NEPA rules. FERC’s new guidelines look quite different from DOE’s rules, which could cause problems. Congress provided a process for agency coordination, but the process assumes that the agencies have the same procedures.

Dubious Weight in Court

Before Trump’s executive order, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued regulations that agencies were required to follow. This led to uniformity across agencies, and the CEQ process was also more deliberative than the preemptory issuance of new regulations that we’re now seeing. One might have thought that it was also more consistent with the idea of the unitary executive.

Be that all as it may, the CEQ regulations had one more important characteristic: they received significant deference from the courts. By contrast, these new regulations will get no deference when courts are interpreting NEPA. Even in the Chevron era, courts did not defer to agency interpretations of statutes when multiple agencies were interpreting the same law.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NEPA3.png,N,,2025-07-07 15:17:38.433800

On Thursday, Republicans in the U.S. House sent a bill to President Trump’s desk that kills tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV customers that were part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The White House has said former President Biden’s initiative “promised much but delivered nothing.” However, the tax credits helped fuel an EV market far more robust and affordable than drivers enjoyed before the rebates kicked in two and a half years ago. Repealing them, along with a flurry of other anti-EV policies put in place or being pursued by the Trump administration, will put a serious dent in sales.

U.S. adoption is set to trail the global average through 2040 and will knock the nation out of the top three EV markets, according to a recent BloombergNEF report. Last year’s version of the report had the country boasting higher-than-average sales starting in 2029.

Still, Elaine Buckberg, a former General Motors economist now at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, estimates that even with federal tax cuts disappearing, some 37% of new cars bought in 2030 will be electric. That’s down from a forecast of 48% if the current incentives remained. The factors propping up some of the demand are fairly straightforward: Electric cars are far better and cheaper than they used to be, and there are many more models to choose from.

“In the most likely scenario, you end up about two years behind on adoption,” Buckberg said. ”I think [EVs] will be more resilient than people are thinking.”

The average price U.S. drivers pay for an EV has ticked slightly lower in the Inflation Reduction Act era, from $64,700 in January 2023 to $59,900 in April, a 7.4% decline without adjusting for inflation, according to Edmunds.com. However, the range of options has widened dramatically.

When the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, there were 34 types of EVs for sale in the U.S., with just 11 models below the average vehicle price of $47,500. Today, there are twice as many electric models to choose from, and 19 have below-average sticker prices. EV incentives in 17 states can bring the cost down even further for some buyers.

“You just have more non-luxury offerings,” Buckberg said. “You’re more likely to find the brand you want, the style you want, the size you want.”

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a director at Cox Automotive, said carmakers and dealers are offering discounts that are often as generous or more so than government incentives. Dealer incentives on a Nissan Leaf, she said, mean “you can get that vehicle for less than $20,000” in some cases.

BNEF expects U.S. EVs will be as cheap or cheaper than gas-powered iterations by roughly 2028 (Goldman Sachs estimates that rubicon could be crossed even sooner).

There’s evidence that a majority of Americans are at least electric-curious. Nearly 60% of U.S. vehicle shoppers are “very” or “somewhat” likely to purchase an EV, according to a May JD Power survey — levels unchanged from a year ago. What’s more, concerns about purchase price and cost of ownership have declined over the last 12 months.

Still, the loss of federal incentives will hit the lower end of the market particularly hard. “The people who have the means to go buy a Rivian or a Lucid are still going to go do that,” said Ingrid Malmgren, the senior policy director at advocacy group Plug In America. “The impact, like so much of the rest of this bill, is inordinately going to be paid for by lower-income Americans.”

Rolling back EV tax credits is also only part of how the Trump administration is favoring internal combustion models. It has frozen a $5-billion federal plan to build charging stations, primarily along rural interstate corridors and in low-income communities. The White House has also promised to lower regulations on tailpipe emissions and moved to block a California policy to ban gasoline-powered car sales by 2035.

Factoring in all of these policy shifts will slow EVs’ momentum even further than the Inflation Reduction Act cuts: BNEF forecasts just 27% of the U.S. market to be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago, and Buckberg expects a similar slowdown.

Outside the U.S., however, EVs remain on a tear thanks to a drop in battery prices and a wave of low-price models rolling out of Chinese factories. BNEF expects one in four new cars sold this year — some 22 million cars and trucks — to come with a plug, a 25% increase over 2024. Two-thirds of those sales will be in China.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5dc8b77/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41%2Faa%2F890f643e64e3a5ac24f6d6f4537d%2F1x-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 14:25:21.420668

The figures reflect mounting challenges across the USA and Europe, where political and economic factors are undermining planned developments.

In the USA, the sector has been particularly hard hit. The federal government’s decision to temporarily halt all offshore wind leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf has effectively paused new project development. This Executive Order, combined with a weak domestic supply chain, poses a major setback to the industry.

Existing projects are also under pressure. The 1.5 GW Atlantic Shores project—led by Shell—was cancelled in June after its air permit was revoked pending review. In April, Equinor’s Empire Wind project faced a stop-work order from the US Department of the Interior, later lifted in May. These developments have eroded confidence among some investors and developers.

Europe accounts for 60% of the cancelled or suspended capacity. While the region’s offshore wind industry is more mature, it has not escaped the effects of shifting market conditions and regulatory delays. Some of the affected projects are expected to be re-evaluated and re-tendered in future auction rounds.

In contrast, China continues to expand its offshore wind capacity, which now exceeds 40 GW. The government has announced reforms to its power pricing system, moving towards market-based electricity prices with a benchmark mechanism to limit volatility. This is aimed at improving investment stability and attracting new capital to the sector.",https://www.windtech-international.com/images/logo/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-07 15:17:10.182942

I hope you celebrated the 4th of July by hanging out with friends, grilling food, and blowing up a small part of the country. It seems like every municipality, yacht club, and restaurant along the Long Island Sound had their own fireworks show, so by the time we left our party on Friday night, the air was thick with smoke. Was this preparation for next year’s 250th celebration or a preview of the future?

I skipped the politics on Thursday as I wanted to take a few days to consider what the passage of Trump’s big tax/budget bill and the formation of a new political party from Elon Musk all meant. I hoped that lounging by the pool, eating my body weight in smoked meats, and engaging in a luxuriously extended game of Ultimate would lead to some sort of illumination. Unfortunately, my initial instinct has held. This feels very much like giving up, so now it’s on automakers not to cede more control of the future to China. I guess this is where I should mention that we have a day left in 90 days/90 deals, and so far, two deals have been made.

While I’m doing this, I should address the other elephant in the room. Or the anti-elephant? Elon Musk is forming a rival political party, and even longtime Tesla supporters are rolling their eyes. This might be an opportunity for GM, which has quietly picked up a lot of the trust that Tesla has shed.

The Repeal Of The Tax Credit Makes Most New EV And Battery Projects Unnecessary

My goal in doing this today is to cover the news and give you, dear readers, a place to talk constructively about what it all means. I might be wrong! It has been known to happen. As I’ve said many times before, there’s no removing politics from cars. Any major industry is as much a victim of politics as whatever pet social issue you might have (for me, it’s outlawing the Designated Hitter in baseball).

Some of our peers have been critical of this website for being apolitical, but I’d argue that we’re one of the most politically active car websites there is. Specifically, The Autopian has been active in encouraging the repeal of nonsensical anti-import kei laws, up to and including talking to legislators and helping state groups organize. What The Autopian is not, specifically, is partisan. Cars are an enormously powerful way to bring people of different experiences and political viewpoints together, which is something this country needs more of, not less. Can car culture save America? I think it could. If you disagree with me about the politics of the moment, but agree with me about the greatness of Škoda, you are welcome here. Or vice-versa. Honestly, just having an opinion about Škoda means this is probably a place for you.

Enough preamble. I’ve been thinking a lot about post-WWII America. Specifically, how America won the post-war period of rapid technologicalization and industrialization. The first big advantage the United States had, of course, was that most of the country hadn’t been destroyed by war. The huge investments the government made in waging the war went towards the creation of more industrial might, which, after the war, turned back into commercial endeavors. Sensing a need for an educated workforce, the “G.I. Bill” was used by roughly half of the 16 million WWII veterans for some kind of education, including the millions who went to universities.

American cars of the ’50s and early ’60s were feature-laden, big, and many times more powerful than the pre-war cars anyone was building. A lot of this is owed to another piece of legislation, which is historically probably the biggest subsidy for carmakers of all time: The National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, put forward by President Eisenhower. There are no cars without roads and, specifically, without the broad and (mostly) straight freeways the country built. I don’t want to get too much into geographic determinism, but there’s an alternative version of this where America built more trains instead of highways. Cars were the more obvious option at the time and quickly helped link cities in a way that was beneficial for industry, but it wasn’t a 100% lock that this was what the future would bring.

We got the roads, and then we got the massive land yachts to fill those roads. Having used those interstates in the last month to cross the country, it makes a sort of sense. As much as I love a 1960s Alfa, that’s not the right car for the job.

Unfortunately, this was literally not sustainable. These thirsty cars could not be a future in any country that was dependent on anyone else for cheap fuel. Nor could these vehicles be a future for any country that didn’t want its children choking on smog. The 1-2 punch of OPEC oil embargoes and environmental regulation to combat pollution led to the Malaise Era of cars. American automakers didn’t have a good plan for this particular future, and the government had to intervene. Japanese companies like Toyota and Honda were the ones who benefited, having created cars that were both smaller and more efficient.

A lot has happened between the Malaise Era and today, with American car companies yet again building bigger and thirstier vehicles, only to retreat to cars that were still big, but also a lot more efficient. Somewhere in there, a combination of the California Air Resources Board and a few government programs led, in fits and starts, to a genuine attempt at making an electric car. The company that took a big chunk of that money and was successful was, of course, Tesla. While a lot of what Tesla was able to accomplish is due to the genius of the various people involved in the project, it didn’t hurt that the government helped fund the project both through direct loans from the Department of Energy and climate credits. Whatever your politics, it’s hard to deny that Tesla’s creation is an example of what happens when American ingenuity is supported.

At the same time, China has, in its own way, pushed towards electrification. It’s been messy, and China’s massive overcapacity is a problem, but the country now controls the battery manufacturing, technology, and resources necessary to build electric cars.

President Biden, with the Inflation Reduction Act and other actions, pushed forward the idea that America should be the place where this kind of innovation and vehicle production happens. There was a mix of carrots (the IRA $7,500 tax credit, massive loans for new battery plants) and sticks (CARB climate credits, stricter emissions standards). Could it have worked? We’ll probably never really know.

With the passage of the combined budget/tax bill, many of those credits are going away. As CBS News reports:

The massive tax and spending cut bill that Congress passed Thursday ends federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.

Buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on EVs before they are terminated. But experts say there are still strong financial reasons to consider buying the vehicles even without those incentives.

Before the bill passed, new electric vehicles came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable.

The counterargument to this is that America shouldn’t be picking one technology over the other. That automakers used this incentive to build expensive EV crossovers instead of smaller, more affordable cars. My response to this is, again, to look at Tesla. The company probably only exists because of these initial programs, and much of its profits have come from climate credits. Building an entirely new industry takes time, especially when so much of what you need to make these cars relies on a government we’re not always the friendliest with right now. As Patrick George wrote in his big piece on this over at InsideEVs:

The lithium-ion battery was born here. But outsourcing them, and all kinds of other consumer goods, has led China to become less of the world’s on-demand contract factory and more of a giant science lab that’s run away with this technology. And it’s not just batteries themselves but the entire supply chain of materials to make them; as the Financial Times reported in April, the U.S. relies on China for 70% of the rare earth compounds and metals it imports, and then companies like Apple and others source directly from there.

Besides the risks of getting a key piece of consumer tech from only one place—a lesson Americans learned the hard way during the semiconductor shortage of the pandemic—there’s the obvious problem of leaving the power source of the future in the hands of a country with which the U.S. has difficult relations on a good day. (Not many people in America would seriously suggest that this country import all of its petroleum from Venezuela, Iran, and Russia.)

I’m not one of those people who believe that, even if the credit stayed in place, consumers would all immediately run out and grab a new EV. That was a belief that led to too much hype and, combined with low interest rates and SPACs, probably set the industry back. I do believe, though, that most cars will be electrified in the future, with a mix of hybrids and EREVs, as well as pure BEVs.

Whether you like it or not, batteries are the future of automobiles. Consumers like the performance and efficiency of electric cars, even if they don’t currently like the price. If it is the future, then ceding that future to anyone else isn’t good for the country. President Trump’s own stated goal is to improve American manufacturing, but this is the opposite of what’s likely to happen. While more carmaking is probably coming (thanks in part to tariffs), less of it is going to be the advanced kind of manufacturing that a switchover to electric cars was likely to bring, at least according to a study from Princeton University’s REPEAT Project:

If clean vehicle tax credits are repealed, as much as 100% of planned construction and expansion of US EV assembly and half of existing capacity could be at risk of cancellation or closure. If the share of EVs manufactured in the US remains at 2024 levels, nearly three-quarters of planned projects would be unnecessary.

Currently planned construction of US battery cell manufacturing demand already exceeds requirements to supply electric vehicles assembled in the United States under a continuation of current policies.

I assume there will be a big boom in electric car purchases this quarter as companies do all they can to shove the EVs they’ve built, or are planning to build, out to market while the cars are this much cheaper. After that, I’m guessing the curve is going to flatten a lot, meaning that all these planned facilities are, as the study above points out, kind of pointless.

My feeling is that this is America’s government giving up on the future, or assuming the future will all be ICE-powered cars and a few hybrids. It’s possible that’s true, but I don’t think so. If this all feels like a major setback to you, all is not lost. There’s still hope, but it’s going to be up to American industry and American automakers to counter it.

What does that look like? There’s Slate Auto, which looked like a great alternative to traditional manufacturing, but that took a giant hit with the passage of this legislation. Hopefully, Rivian can hold on long enough to build its smaller and more affordable vehicles. General Motors has reached a sort of profitability with its electric vehicles, though how that holds up without the tax credit isn’t clear. I’m excited about Ford’s skunkworks EV project, which hopefully exists outside of the need for the $7,500 tax credit.

The fact is that the federal government has taken a step backward both in requiring more efficient vehicles and in funding the creation of them. This means that companies will have to decide how much it’s worth it to do it with fewer carrots and fewer sticks.

’90 Deals In 90 Days’ Has One Day To Make 88 Deals

By my math, President Trump’s promise to do 90 deals in 90 days has about a day left, and only two deals have been done. The first was the United Kingdom trade deal, and the second is one with Vietnam. This is a big one, as the United States has long favored the country as a friendlier alternative to China, although Chinese manufacturers have used Vietnam’s special status to try to pass goods through to the United States at a lower cost.

The way it works is that there’s now a 20% tariff on goods from Vietnam and a 40% tariff on any trans-shipments that pass through the country. What does the United States get?

From The Guardian:

Vietnam would also provide the United States with more market access, with US exports to the country facing no tariffs, Trump said. That agreement appears to include US exporters of large-engine cars, according to Trump and Vietnamese state media.

“It is my Great Honor to announce that I have just made a Trade Deal with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,” Trump said on Truth Social.

“It is my opinion that the SUV or, as it is sometimes referred to, Large Engine Vehicle, which does so well in the United States, will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam,” Trump said.

No one in this country refers to SUVs as “Large Engine Vehicles,” but I have a sense of where that’s coming from. There’s been an ongoing threat from China against European automakers focused on vehicles with large engines, so perhaps that’s what he’s talking about?

Elon Musk Starts A Third Party, Making Trump And Tesla Investors Unhappy

The once glowing partnership between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk spectacularly blew up last month, and now it’s again in the news as President Trump took to his social media platform to blast Musk’s creation of a third party (the American Party), and Musk responded on his own social media platform by mocking the President via retweet.

Like a landmine covered in armadillo crap, I ain’t touching that. My advice to you is simply: Walk away.

That’s not possible for Tesla investors, however, as Tesla investors have been begging Musk to get back to work and, to some of them, this does not feel like getting back to work. As one investor told Bloomberg:

Devoting resources and attention to a new political party runs counter to what Musk told Tesla investors during the company’s last earnings, in April — that he’d allocate “far more” of his time to the company after his work for the Trump administration ended.

“The board is going to have to get involved,” Dan Ives, an equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Bloomberg Television, saying he was frustrated as a supporter of Tesla. “There’s a line in the sand that he’s now starting to cross.”

Um, this is the line in the sand? How big is this freakin’ beach?

GM Is Ready To Pick Up Tesla Customers

I assume there will be a large run on Tesla products in the coming months as consumers, at least the ones disinterested in politics, recognize that the Model Y is still an enormous bargain for what you get. Could some of those consumers maybe be looking to buy a General Motors product? Maybe!

GM has been building market share in electric cars while Tesla has been shedding it, as the Detroit Free Press points out:

The Detroit automaker accelerated electric vehicle sales and market share in the first half of the year thanks to expanded electric offerings across three of its four brands. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment for Texas-based rival Tesla cratered this spring due to criticism over Musk’s hands-on involvement in Washington politics.

“GM is quietly building trust while Elon burns it,” said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis for AutoPacifi­c. “Consumers are responding to consistency, not volatility, and GM’s steady hand is starting to pay dividends.”

Now is a great time to buy a base Equinox EV is all I’m saying.

The analysis also reveals an 18 percent increase in wider domestic renewable energy uptake for the last six months vs January-June 2024, with heat pumps, battery storage and solar panels all seeing boosts in installation numbers. This comes after recent findings from iChoosr shows almost half of UK adults want to become more eco-conscious to look after the planet (47 percent), one third are interested in installing solar panels (32 percent) and one in five in installing a heat pump (18 percent).

This follows the launch, on 30 June, of the Government’s new Solar Roadmap, which it describes as ‘a pathway for the UK to rapidly accelerate the roll out of solar, helping drive down bills, supporting tens of thousands of jobs and powering economic growth with clean energy’.

“We welcome the government’s aims to reduce carbon emissions and cut household energy bills, and it’s especially encouraging to see increasing practical and financial support for the adoption of renewable energy sources across the UK” said George Frost, UK Country Manager at iChoosr.

iChoosr helped enable over 5 percent of UK domestic solar panel system installations in the first six months of 2025. This is by partnering with local authorities to deliver schemes which enable large-scale adoption of renewable energy sources, including solar panels, battery storage, EV chargers and heat pumps, as well as energy switching to renewable electricity tariffs. Its digital platforms simplify decision-making and reduce costs through community group-buying, connecting energy-conscious residents to qualified energy suppliers and installers.

“We are proud that our group-buying schemes are accounting for an ever-growing share of green energy installations” added Mr Frost. “We know that many in the UK want to take steps to go greener, although they struggle to know where to start. Our goal is to empower individuals to make confident, informed choices, removing barriers to renewable energy options by making them more affordable and accessible.”

Globally, more than 11 million households have joined iChoosr’s schemes so far, including Solar Together – a group-buying solar panel scheme, the Switch Together heat pump scheme - offering access to professional and competitively priced heat pump installations, and Big Community Switch – a collective energy switching scheme to save money on bills.

Final notes on OBBB implementation OBBB has changed tax provisions relating to research and development expenses, depreciation deductions, certain energy credits and handling of employee retention tax credits.","On July 4, 2025, after months of deliberation and negotiation, lawmakers enacted “The One Big, Beautiful Bill” (OBBB). The legislation delivers a robust tax reform package that’s reshaping the U.S. tax code.

It permanentely extends existing provisions, repeals or modifies others, and introduces new measures.

Below is a breakdown of the most impactful changes related to research and development, depreciation, energy credits, and employee retention tax credits.

Research and Development

OBBB introduces long-anticipated reforms to the tax treatment of research and experimental (R&E) expenditures.

The most significant change is the creation of new Section 174A. Which allows businesses to immediately expense domestic R&E costs, reversing the prior law’s amortization requirement.

Section 174 remains, but it now applies solely to foreign R&E expenditures. Which must be amortized over 15 years.

New Section 174A: Domestic R&E Expensing

Beginning in tax years after December 31, 2024, taxpayers may fully deduct domestic R&E expenditures in the year incurred. These are costs paid or incurred within the U.S. as part of the taxpayer’s trade or business.

Foreign R&E costs, as defined in IRC §41(d)(4)(F), are excluded.

Scope and Limitations

Section 174A does not apply to:

Expenditures for the acquisition or improvement of land or depreciable property

Mineral exploration expenditures (including oil and gas).

However, domestic R&E expenditures eligible for expensing under §174A explicitly include software development costs.

Small Business Retroactive Relief

Eligible taxpayers (excluding tax shelters) that satisfy the gross receipts test under section 448(c) for their first tax year beginning after December 31, 2024, may elect to amend prior returns.

They can apply the new Section 174A rules to tax years 2022–2024, which were previously subject to mandatory Section 174 capitalization.

For tax years beginning in 2025, the section 448(c) gross receipts test is met.

Eligible taxpayers must make this election within one year of the bill’s enactment date.

Accelerate Previous Capitalized and Amortized Expenses

All taxpayers may elect to deduct remaining unamortized amounts entirely in 2025. Or deduct such amounts ratably over two years, 2025 and 2026.

This change is treated as an automatic method change, applied on a cut-off basis without requiring §481 adjustments.

Planning

Effective after December 1, 2024, OBBB repeals the amortization requirement imposed by Tax Cuts Job Act (TCJA) under section 174. Businesses may now immediately deduct eligible domestic research expenditures in the year they’re incurred.

Businesses now can again fully deduct qualifying domestic research expenses in the year incurred. This change restores the pre-TCJA tax treatment of immediate qualifying domestic research expenses, thereby helping to reduce taxable income.

It further simplifies tax compliance by reducing the need to track amortization schedules for qualified domestic research expenditures.

This change gives businesses faster tax relief for research investments and enhances the benefit and utility of the research credit. Accordingly, businesses should reassess their tax planning and consider elections before the end of 2025 to optimize benefits.

Depreciation

The recently enacted OBBB includes several significant tax provisions affecting businesses. Among the most impactful are permanent changes to bonus depreciation and enhancements to the Section 179 expensing limits.

Bonus Depreciation and New Section 168(n) Election

The legislation permanently reinstates 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025.

Additionally, Section 168(n) introduces a new elective depreciation regime for nonresidential real property classified as ‘qualified production property.

This optional 100% depreciation applies to property with construction starting after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2029, and placed in service by December 31, 2030.

Qualified production property includes facilities used in manufacturing of tangible personal property, agricultural production, chemical production, or refining. Any portions of buildings used for offices, administrative functions, lodging, parking, sales, research, software development, or unrelated activities are excluded.

Expanded Section 179 Expensing

The bill raises the Section 179 deduction limit to $2.5 million, with a phaseout threshold of $4 million. Effective for property placed in service after 2024.

Both thresholds will be adjusted annually for inflation.

Planning

Accelerated depreciation helps businesses deduct most or all of a qualifying property’s cost in the year it’s placed in service. Rather than depreciating it over several years.

This means lower taxable income and taxes in the current year, which boosts liquidity and enables reinvestment.

Energy Provisions

The enactment of OBBB rolls back several clean energy tax provisions introduced or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The bill accelerates sunset dates for key credits, imposes stricter domestic content requirements, and bars participation by certain foreign-affiliated entities.

These changes will impact investors, developers, and manufacturers operating in the renewable energy space.

Phasing Out Key IRA Clean Energy Credits

The new law scales back multiple IRA-era clean energy incentives by advancing their expiration dates.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Restrictions

The new law bars eligibility for clean energy credits for projects owned, controlled by, or involving materials sourced from FEOCs. This includes indirect equity ownership or management participation. These rules apply retroactively to in-development projects that have not yet been placed in service.

Domestic Content Rules Remain Critical

To qualify for a 10% bonus rate, projects must use U.S.-produced steel, iron, and manufactured components. Proper documentation and certification are required. Failure to meet domestic content or FEOC requirements may result in credit loss or IRS enforcement.

45L: Home Energy Efficiency Credit

This provision amends Section 45L(h), which governs the New Energy Efficient Home Credit, a tax credit for eligible homebuilders and developers who construct or manufacture energy-efficient homes.

The new Section 45L credit accelerates the termination date for homes with construction starting after June 30, 2026.

Homes acquired (sold or leased) after June 30, 2026 will no longer qualify for the Section 45L credit.

This change significantly shortens the time developers and builders can benefit from this incentive. It may impact planning and construction timelines, especially for projects that expected to qualify through 2032.

179D: Energy Efficient Commercial Building Property

Section 179D offers a tax deduction for energy-efficient commercial building property. The OBBB adds a termination clause that disqualifies any construction starting after June 30, 2026, from the Section 179D deduction.

Only buildings or systems with construction starting on or before June 30, 2026 remain eligible under the new law. Taxpayers must begin construction by June 30, 2026 to qualify for the energy-efficient building deduction.

Investment Tax Credit/Production Tax Credit under Sections 45Y & 48E

Taxpayers generally may claim the section 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC) for electricity produced and sold by a qualifying facility.

Alternatively, taxpayers may claim the section 48E Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for qualified investments in a qualified facility or energy storage technology.

A “qualified facility” typically means one with greenhouse gas emissions below zero, usually including wind or solar energy generators.

To qualify, projects using PTC or ITC must start construction within 12 months of the legislation’s enactment.

Projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, are no longer eligible for these credits.

Planning

These changes to energy provisions require businesses to consider accelerating project starts to align with enhanced credit rates or expanded eligibility. Therefore, it is important to coordinate construction and placed-in-service dates to maximize credit claims.

Additionally, taxpayers should consider combining energy credits with bonus depreciation and §179 expensing to maximize immediate tax benefits and improve cash flow.

This includes conducting cost segregation studies on renewable energy properties to accelerate depreciation of non-structural components.

Employee Retention Tax Credit

OBBB introduces significant provisions impacting taxpayers with outstanding Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claims, particularly for the third and fourth quarters of 2021. These changes also heighten scrutiny on promoters involved in ERC filings, altering both compliance requirements and enforcement timelines.

Deadline for Filing ERC Refund Claims

The new legislation establishes a firm cutoff date for claiming ERC refunds related to third quarter (and fourth quarter for recovery startups) of 2021.

Specifically, the IRS will disallow any refund claims submitted after January 31, 2024.

Extended Statute of Limitations

In addition to the filing deadline, the bill extends the IRS’s statute of limitations to allow a six-year period for examination, adjustment, or assessment of ERC claims for the third and fourth quarters of 2021.

The extended statute of limitations would generally expire on April 15, 2028 or six years after filing the claim for credit or refunds, if later.

Aligned with the extended assessment statute, the legislation also extends the statute of limitations for credits or refunds on income tax related to wages not claimed as a deduction.

Increased Enforcement on ERC Promoters

The legislation also imposes tougher penalties and compliance standards on individuals and entities promoting ERC claims.

The IRS now has expanded authority to take action against promoter misconduct tied to ERC filings.

Planning Practical Implications and Recommendations

Given the increased IRS enforcement powers and longer exposure period, affected taxpayers and advisors should prepare for potential examinations and maintain comprehensive supporting records.

Final notes on OBBB implementation

OBBB has changed tax provisions relating to research and development expenses, depreciation deductions, certain energy credits and handling of employee retention tax credits.

Careful attention to these rules and the need for required documentation and compliance is essential to mitigate risks and preserve taxpayer benefits under the new law.

“One of the things I enjoy most about my major is that even though I want to specifically focus on the environment for my career, I still get the interdisciplinary nature of economics,” Aucker said.
“I take classes in [the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics] and CANR, but I’ve also had geology classes in Earth, Ocean and Environment, and music classes in Arts and Sciences.
“But I’ve also always enjoyed community work, so I could see myself at an environmental nonprofit as well.
“I am particularly interested in food issues, like the food system, how food distribution works and food access issues,” Aucker said.","Aucker’s enthusiasm and grasp of the material earned her a teaching assistant (TA) position for the course with Christina McGranaghan, assistant professor in the Department of Applied Economics and Statistics (APEC).

“I asked her to become a teaching assistant for me because I felt that she was passionate about the topic and she clearly had a really strong understanding of the material,” McGranaghan said. “She is great at communicating and engaging with others, so she seemed like a great fit for the role.”

Aucker completed her third semester as a TA for APEC150, and she has no intention of stopping.

“When I took [APEC150], it was the first class that made me feel like, ‘Okay, this is what my major is supposed to be about,’”Aucker said. “I am very passionate about this subject, especially when students come in, one-on-one, for my office hours. I really enjoy getting the chance to help them work through things and maybe make them as excited about it as I am.”

Beyond academics, Aucker helps foster community within the UD College of Agriculture and Natural Resources (CANR). With the help of McGranaghan, Aucker created a Canvas page with dedicated resources for the two CANR majors — environmental and resource economics and food and agribusiness marketing and management.

“The Canvas page brings the opportunities to the students, but also brings our students closer together,” Aucker said. “I hope to have LinkedIn workshops, professors come talk about their research, an APEC alumni panel or fun social events.”

This initiative also laid the groundwork for the formation of the Applied Economics Student Association, where Aucker serves as secretary, working to enhance professional development and networking for students.

She is also an active member of the Women in Economics Club, Horticulture Club and the Student Government Association (SGA), where she serves as Sustainability Senator.

“One of the things I enjoy most about my major is that even though I want to specifically focus on the environment for my career, I still get the interdisciplinary nature of economics,” Aucker said. “I take classes in [the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics] and CANR, but I’ve also had geology classes in Earth, Ocean and Environment, and music classes in Arts and Sciences. My major gives me the freedom to meet a ton of new people all the time.”

In SGA, she works to identify gaps in the University’s sustainability and accessibility initiatives to develop policy proposals to address them.

“I’ve been working with the previous sustainability senator to go through what the Office of Sustainability is like, what their action plan is now and what they want to accomplish,” Aucker said. “I am mainly trying to look for any gaps I saw that can be addressed by SGA initiatives.”

Aucker’s work with the SGA and Applied Economics Student Association is enhanced by her time as a Community Engagement Scholar, which reinforced her interest in community-based work.

This past spring break, she participated in a UD Alternative Breaks (UDaB), volunteering in Washington, D.C., at Bread for the City, learning about food banks and food aid.

“I’ve participated in service before, but the program I was on was incredibly immersive and our community partners, Bread for the City, were also wonderful,” Aucker said. “I learned a lot about food banks and food aid which made me even more excited to hopefully participate in research this summer.”

While Aucker remains open to various different career fields, environmental stewardship and community service remain at the core of her motivations.

“I think it would be cool to work for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or some other government environmental organization,” Aucker said. “But I’ve also always enjoyed community work, so I could see myself at an environmental nonprofit as well. If I don’t go into something research based, that would be what I’m most interested in.”

According to McGranaghan, students who come out of UD with an ENRE degree can take various post-graduate paths, including careers in public policy, sustainability, education and research — for example, by pursuing graduate programs and research fellowships in non-governmental organizations.

“Our majors prepare students for a wide range of environment-related careers,” McGranaghan said. “I also see many students go into environmental consulting, where they consult for state or federal governments or non-governmental organizations. For example, our students might help to quantify the benefits of ecosystem service projects in economic terms.”

Right now, Aucker is interested in pursuing issues surrounding the U.S. food system and sustainability.

“I am particularly interested in food issues, like the food system, how food distribution works and food access issues,” Aucker said. We’re failing at the last one a lot of the time, and I’m interested in learning what policy can do to remedy that.”

McGranaghan emphasized that students, like Aucker, with this dual passion for the environment and economics have no shortage of opportunities. Especially as they tend to be passionate about environmental issues and analyzing these problems through an economic lens.

“Our students want to better understand human decision making and behavior and how that impacts the environment,” McGranaghan said.“A better understanding of these human dimensions can help shape policies that effectively protect the environment, or that encourage people to act in more environmentally friendly ways.”",https://www.udel.edu/content/dam/udelImages/udaily/2025/july/auker-udaily-primary-image-800x420px.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 15:17:46.093214

Tesla must prove safety and scale to compete with ride-share incumbents like Uber, which has surged nearly 12% since the Tesla robotaxi launch.","Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped sharply Monday, falling over 7% by mid-morning, after a whirlwind weekend in which CEO Elon Musk announced the formation of a new political party and U.S. policies eliminated key electric vehicle incentives.

The decline comes at a pivotal time for Tesla, which is facing weakening demand in key global markets, declining EV subsidies, and intensifying competition—especially in China.

Musk forms “America Party”

On Saturday, Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he is launching the “America Party” after polling his followers on the need for political alternatives. “We live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” he wrote. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”

Market analysts see the announcement as a distraction from Tesla’s core business.

“Musk diving deeper into politics is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla shareholders want him to take,” said Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush.

This political move follows Musk’s previous resignation from the Trump-aligned Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which investors initially viewed as a positive for Tesla’s focus.

EV tax credits repealed

The blow to Tesla wasn’t limited to Musk’s political maneuvering. Over the weekend, President Trump signed a sweeping tax bill that eliminates the $7,500 federal EV tax credit after September 30, 2025.

That law also:

Immediately ends zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credit sales—a key source of revenue for Tesla.

Increases tariffs on imported Chinese EV components, raising Tesla’s costs.

Tesla will likely see a short-term boost in Q3 as buyers rush to qualify for remaining credits. But analysts predict a sharp drop in U.S. sales after October, especially for models that heavily relied on the incentive.

Robotaxi rollout shadowed by minor incident

Tesla’s June 22 launch of its robotaxi fleet in Austin, Texas—while a long-term bet—has had a bumpy start. Most rides have been smooth, but over the weekend one vehicle brushed a parked Toyota Camry while attempting to self-park.

While minor, the incident adds to skepticism over removing human monitors. Tesla must prove safety and scale to compete with ride-share incumbents like Uber, which has surged nearly 12% since the Tesla robotaxi launch.

Global competition ramps up

Tesla’s international position is also under pressure:

China’s Xiaomi YU7, a new crossover, began deliveries Sunday with over 200,000 pre-orders in minutes. It’s seen as a direct threat to the Tesla Model Y.

Xiaomi’s SU7 sedan is already outselling the Model 3 in China.

Tesla’s European market share continues to erode amid newer, cheaper competitors.

Stock technicals and outlook

Tesla stock fell 6.6% to $292.85 in early trading. This puts TSLA below the July 1 support level of $293.21, raising the risk of a deeper correction. Key watch points include:

$273.21 (June 5 low) as next support

Potential base-building if shares stabilize above $285

The stock had gained earlier in Q2 on delivery optimism and reduced political noise. That trend has reversed.

What investors are watching

Will Musk step back from political distractions?

Can Tesla maintain margins without ZEV credits?

Will robotaxi progress offset declining sales?

Can Tesla fend off competition from Xiaomi and others?

Tesla faces headwinds on multiple fronts—political, financial, and technological. Analysts say the company’s near-term outlook will depend heavily on Q3 sales, response to EV subsidy loss, and Musk’s ability to refocus on the core business.

EPA must abandon this proposal.” The second proposal would repeal the recent technology review update that strengthened the MATS for coal-fired power plants.
The proposal would allow more emissions of hazardous air pollutants (air toxics) from coal plants and eliminate continuous monitoring requirements that increase transparency regarding metal air toxics emissions.
“This proposal is a step in the wrong direction for the decades-long effort to control particularly hazardous air pollution from coal-fired power plants.
By weakening these important standards, EPA would allow coal-fired power plants to release greater amounts of pollutants like mercury and arsenic that threaten public health and the environment,” said Hayden Hashimoto, attorney at CATF.","Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to repeal two regulations that it finalized last year: the carbon pollution standards existing coal-fired and new gas-fired power plants and the strengthened Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for coal-fired power plants.

“These regressive proposals are bad for public health and bad for climate, all to prop up some of the highest polluting power plants in the nation,” said Shaun Goho, legal director at Clean Air Task Force (CATF). “These standards were put in place for a reason – to fulfill the EPA’s legal obligations to protect public health and the environment from harmful pollution by using the most up-to-date technical and scientific evidence. And the science is clear: if EPA is successful in its repeal of these regulations, the American people will suffer the consequences.”

The first proposal would repeal the carbon pollution standards that EPA finalized last year for existing coal- and new gas-fired power plants, as well as standards for new coal power plants that were finalized in 2015.

“EPA is proposing to turn a blind eye to the largest stationary source of carbon pollution in the U.S. – power plants – in a misguided action that would wipe out the legally required standards and their public health and climate benefits,” said Frank Sturges, attorney at CATF. “The standards are estimated to reduce tens of thousands of tons of health-harming pollution and more than one billion tons of climate-harming carbon dioxide emissions – all that would be lost if the standards were scrapped. The proposed repeal also runs afoul of EPA’s pollution reduction obligation under the Clean Air Act and cannot refute the robust scientific and technical foundation supporting the standards currently in effect. EPA must abandon this proposal.”

The second proposal would repeal the recent technology review update that strengthened the MATS for coal-fired power plants. The proposal would allow more emissions of hazardous air pollutants (air toxics) from coal plants and eliminate continuous monitoring requirements that increase transparency regarding metal air toxics emissions.

“This proposal is a step in the wrong direction for the decades-long effort to control particularly hazardous air pollution from coal-fired power plants. By weakening these important standards, EPA would allow coal-fired power plants to release greater amounts of pollutants like mercury and arsenic that threaten public health and the environment,” said Hayden Hashimoto, attorney at CATF. “The vast majority of coal plants have already achieved the performance required by the updated MATS rule, which ensures some of the worst performing plants achieve the level of performance of their peers. EPA’s proposal would sacrifice cleaner air and a healthier environment – especially for communities disproportionately impacted by this pollution – for the benefit of a small number of particularly dirty coal plants. We urge EPA to reconsider and not finalize this repeal of the updated air toxics standards.”

The Clean Air Act requires stringent regulation of these pollutants, which include mercury – a potent neurotoxin – and nine other hazardous air pollutants that have been classified as human carcinogens or probable human carcinogens. These standards must be reviewed periodically and keep pace with developments and information regarding pollution controls, which over the last decade have shown that plants can do much better at reducing emissions of these air toxics than required by the 2012 rule. The rule EPA is seeking to repeal was finalized in 2024 based on a robust record showing what coal plants could achieve, and the Supreme Court rejected attempts to stay the rule.",https://ethicalmarketingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cropped-twitter-logo-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:27:05.018274

Those higher costs will be passed on to households and businesses, exacerbating the energy inflation Americans are already dealing with.

The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act will instead put the U.S. further behind on clean energy, and possibly AI too.
For reasons economical as much as ecological, the future will be dictated by clean energy.","President Donald Trump got his ​“One Big, Beautiful Bill,” and a Fourth of July signing ceremony to boot. America got the removal of 11.8 million people from health insurance programs, tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy — and the dissolution of both longstanding and newly erected pillars of energy and industrial policy.

The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act is a law not of creation but destruction. It’s the antithesis of former President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better Act, which was ultimately pared down into the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. That law sought to push America toward the future, toward clean energy. This new law tethers the country to the past, to coal and oil and gas.

It eliminates a set of subsidies that have, over decades, helped solar and wind mature from niche technologies to cornerstones of our power grid. It scraps tax credits for rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and heat pumps, making it more expensive for the average person to buy these cleaner options. It threatens to pull the rug out from under manufacturers who, encouraged by the incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act, had chosen to build new factories to make products like solar panels and lithium-ion batteries in the United States.

Jobs will be lost. Energy will get even more expensive. Billions more tons of carbon dioxide will escape into the atmosphere, needlessly, trapping more and more heat under the lid of a planet that is already boiling over.

Though dozens of congressional Republicans voiced their support for various clean energy subsidies in recent months — and though Republican congressional districts benefit most from the manufacturing boom the incentives have created — Trump’s signature legislation ultimately faced almost no resistance. Browbeaten by the president, every GOP lawmaker who had signed onto letters supporting clean-energy incentives voted for the law, save one. That lone holdout was Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who had announced his retirement days before.

Progress made, progress lost?

In effect, the new law repeals much of the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark law that was not only helping the United States reduce its carbon emissions, but also gave the country a much-needed injection of industrial policy. It was a rare, coherent attempt to marshal the might of the U.S. government to boost an industry — in this case, clean energy — deemed critical to national interests.

That policy was working.

After the law went into effect and introduced a new subsidy for clean-energy factories, the long-stagnant U.S. manufacturing and industrial base began to undergo a remarkable revitalization.

Firms unveiled plans to invest more than $100 billion to build solar-panel and EV and battery factories that would create an estimated 115,000 jobs. Construction spending on U.S. manufacturing facilities grew far faster than it has since the turn of the century. One major metal company announced plans to build the first new aluminum smelter in the U.S. in 45 years, the result of an ambitious Biden-era program that sought to power heavy industrial processes without fossil fuels. That same program spurred plans for futuristic new steel plants that would operate without coal. The Trump administration dismantled that program in May, and the fate of those projects remains unclear.

The Inflation Reduction Act greatly accelerated the development of clean energy. This trend was underway before Biden’s law went into effect, thanks to a pair of tax credits, one of which dates back to George H. W. Bush’s administration and the other of which to the second term of George W. Bush. Biden’s signature climate law took these existing policies and expanded them, turbocharging the already-rapid rise of renewables. The results speak for themselves: As of last year the U.S. now gets more electricity from wind and solar than from coal. Big grid batteries have helped Texas and California keep the lights on during heat waves.

Now, with the repeal of those and other incentives, it’s expected that the U.S. will plug somewhere between 57% and 72% less clean energy into the grid over the next decade. Because clean energy accounts for nearly all new electricity capacity built in the U.S., it’s unclear what, if anything, would fill in that gap. It won’t be new gas-fueled plants — turbine orders are severely backed up. The solar, wind, and battery projects that do get built will be more expensive because the clean-energy subsidies are now gone. Those higher costs will be passed on to households and businesses, exacerbating the energy inflation Americans are already dealing with.

The timing could not be worse. Around the country, demand for electricity is anticipated to grow at a pace not seen in years. One of the biggest drivers is the proliferation of data centers that underpin increasingly popular AI systems like ChatGPT — and can use as much power as a small city. Making energy scarce right when it’s needed most will put even more upward pressure on power bills. And without abundant electricity, the U.S. will struggle to compete with China on AI.

China already dominates all things clean energy, making and installing more of all its various forms than most other countries combined. The Inflation Reduction Act was meant to help the U.S. wrest some control back from China in those technologies. The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act will instead put the U.S. further behind on clean energy, and possibly AI too.

Big, beautiful contradictions

It’s difficult to square the destruction of these policies with Republicans’ stated priorities.

The GOP and Trump himself have repeatedly extolled the virtues of affordable and abundant energy. They’ve spoken about the need to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. They say they want to maintain economic competitiveness with China, and certainly want to come out ahead in the AI race.

And yet the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act will essentially eliminate the only industrial policy the U.S. had in place to enable it to accomplish those goals.

Maybe the fossil fuel money, which has flowed toward Republicans and Trump like an oil spill, explains this behavior. Or perhaps, as writers like Derek Thompson have suggested, all of this is simply about owning the libs. Certainly fear of crossing Trump forced Republicans to fall in line. He wanted badly to extend his tax cuts, and slashing clean energy will help pay for a tiny portion of doing so.

Some congressional Republicans have reasoned that solar, wind, EVs, and other forms of clean energy are mature enough to no longer need subsidies. It’s true that these technologies have come a long way, but fossil fuels continue to receive hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies in the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund. There are no signs that this spigot will be turned off. In fact, the GOP’s bill will toss one slice of the industry another $150 million each year in direct subsidies.

Whatever the reason, the effect is clear. The U.S. under Trump has hitched itself to fossil fuels, to combustion, to literally ancient forms of energy that more forward-thinking countries will be leaving behind in the coming decades. For reasons economical as much as ecological, the future will be dictated by clean energy.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2222872842.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=5743ffc8035d8f2c11795d5c04717b6b,N,,2025-07-07 12:24:27.939840

§ 7607(b)(1)) establishes three venue categories governing where petitioners should file challenges to EPA actions.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Observations These decisions will likely force a reconsideration of other challenges to EPA actions currently before various Circuits.","The U.S. Supreme Court issued two simultaneous opinions on June 18, 2025, that, between them, offer additional guidance as to the appropriate federal appellate court into which parties must bring challenges to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) actions under the Clean Air Act (CAA or ""the Act""). The Court established a two-part test in Environmental Protection Agency v. Calumet Shreveport Refining, LLC, et al., 605 U.S. ____ (No. 23-1229) as part of determining a group of small refineries must bring their challenge to EPA’s denial of their renewable fuel program exemption petitions before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. It then used that same two-part test in Oklahoma, et al., v. Environmental Protection Agency, et al., 605 U.S. ___ (No. 23-1067), to conclude the Tenth Circuit, i.e., the “local or regional” appellate court, was the appropriate forum in which to hear Oklahoma and Utah’s challenges to their treatment under EPA’s “Good Neighbor Plan.”

Environmental Protection Agency v. Calumet Shreveport Refining, LLC, et al. (Calumet)

Background

The Clean Air Act’s Renewable Fuels Program (RFP) requires most domestic refineries to blend a certain level of renewable fuels into the fuels they produce. Refineries demonstrate compliance with this requirement either through Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits they generate via blending or by buying or selling RIN credits. The Act currently allows refineries whose average aggregate daily crude oil throughput for a calendar year is no more than 75,000 barrels to petition for an exemption from the RFP because of “disproportionate economic hardship.” EPA denied a total of 105 small refineries’ exemption petitions in two omnibus notices, for two reasons: (1) EPA interpreted the phrase “disproportionate economic hardship” to apply only to hardship caused by RFP compliance; and (2) none of the petitioners suffered such hardship because RIN costs are passed fully onto consumers.

Review of EPA Actions

CAA section 307(b)(1) (42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1)) establishes three venue categories governing where petitioners should file challenges to EPA actions. Challenges to a “nationally applicable"" final action taken by EPA are reviewed by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. A final action that is “locally or regionally applicable” is to be reviewed in the relevant regional Circuit. Finally, an action that otherwise would fall in this latter category must be reviewed by the D.C. Circuit “if [it] is based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect” and “if in taking such action [EPA] finds and publishes that such action is based on such a determination.”

Refineries whose RFP exemption petitions were denied filed challenges to those denials in numerous regional Circuits, despite EPA’s assertion in the two notices that its denials were reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit. Most Circuits agreed with EPA and either dismissed the challenges before them or transferred them to the D.C. Circuit.

The Fifth Circuit, however, determined it had jurisdiction to hear the challenges by six petitioners because the legal effect of EPA’s notices was limited to the petitioning refineries and because EPA considered refinery-specific facts as part of its denials. This, the court determined, made EPA’s actions “locally or regionally applicable.” Having confirmed jurisdiction, the Fifth Circuit went on to rule against EPA on the merits and vacated and remanded the six denials for further consideration. EPA appealed and the Supreme Court granted certiorari to clarify where venue properly lies.

New Two-Step Venue Test

Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the seven-member majority, established a two-step test for determining venue under CAA section 307(b)(1). Under the first step, if the action is nationally applicable, the inquiry is complete because the D.C. Circuit is the appropriate venue. If the action is locally or regionally applicable, however, the reviewing court must undertake the second step to determine if the “nationwide scope and effect” exception applies such that the D.C. Circuit, not the regional Circuit, is the proper forum.

Under the first step, the “action” is determined by the substantive authority EPA acts under, not (necessarily) the way EPA couches the activity. The “action” in this case was EPA’s denial of each individual exemption petition. The Court determined each denial was “locally or regionally applicable” because the denial of a refinery’s petition applies only to that refinery.

With that, the Court moved onto the second step to determine if the “nationwide scope and effect” exception applied to override the default to the regional Circuits. An EPA determination is of “nationwide” scope and effect if it applies legally and practically throughout the entire country and its “justification of nationwide breadth is the primary explanation for and driver of EPA’s action.” The Court determined EPA’s interpretation of the phrase “disproportionate economic hardship” under the Act and its RIN passthrough theory were determinations of nationwide scope or effect because they applied to all refineries everywhere. It further found those determinations formed the core basis for EPA’s denials. The fact that EPA applied refinery-specific considerations to confirm each denial did not obviate the national “core” rationales for each denial. And, because EPA noted these nationwide rationales in its notices, it satisfied the second prong of the “nationwide scope and effect” exception. The Court vacated the Fifth Circuit’s decision and remanded the case back to it for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court’s opinion.

Oklahoma, et al., v. Environmental Protection Agency, et al. (Oklahoma)

Background

Oklahoma marks the second time in as many years the Supreme Court has issued a ruling related to EPA’s 2023 “Good Neighbor Plan” (GNP), which was EPA’s rejection of all or parts of 23 State Implementation Plans (SIPs) implementing the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and its issuance of a Federal Implementation Plan in their place. See Fredrikson’s summary of the GNP and the Court’s 2024 decision related to it, Ohio v. EPA. In this round, the Court considered whether the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals properly transferred Oklahoma and Utah’s challenges to the rejection of their SIPs under the GNP to the D.C. Circuit. Although it employed the two-step analysis it created in Calumet to EPA’s challenged GNP actions, the Court came to different conclusion, i.e., that EPA’s rejections of the two SIPs were “locally or regionally applicable actions” to which the “nationwide scope and effect” exception did not apply.

Application of the Calumet Test

Under step one of its newly established venue test, the Court found the disputed “action” to be EPA’s rejection of each state’s SIP. It was not, as EPA argued, the aggregation of all the denials into a single new rule. Categorization of the “action,” once established, was then easy because EPA action implementation plans is the first among the enumerated “locally or regionally applicable” actions listed under section 307(b)(1), with each SIP (dis)approval being its own action.

As for the second step, the Court noted EPA, in its aggregated Federal Register notice on the SIP disapprovals, did claim its determinations were based on a determination of nationwide scope and effect. The Court nevertheless rejected the validity of that assertion. An EPA action cannot have “nationwide scope and effect” if its justification is based primarily on “intensely factual,” non-nationwide considerations or if the key driver is debatable. EPA rejected each SIP based on a set of facts and considerations that were specific to that SIP, as opposed to the generally applicable, nationwide justifications given for its actions in Calumet. The Court therefore reversed the Tenth Circuit’s decision to transfer the matter to the D.C. Circuit and remanded the case to the former for further proceedings.

Justice Thomas again wrote the majority opinion (8-0 this time, with Justice Alito taking no part in the decision).

Observations

These decisions will likely force a reconsideration of other challenges to EPA actions currently before various Circuits. For instance, last year, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals granted EPA’s motion to transfer to the D.C. Circuit a series of challenges to the latter’s 2024 amendments to the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Taconite Iron Ore Processing, even though affected mines only exist in Minnesota and Michigan. Those challenges are currently on hold but will likely face a venue reconsideration, if they continue.

Notably, although the Supreme Court has issued two rulings related to challenges to EPA’s Good Neighbor Plan, no court—including the Supreme Court—has yet to make any determination on the merits of those challenges.

The EPA has suggested it intends to rescind the GNP. Doing so will not alleviate challenges surrounding the Clean Air Act’s “good neighbor” provision regarding the disputed ozone NAAQS, however. Downwind states who would have benefited from implementation of the GNP will still expect EPA and the relevant states to satisfy their “good neighbor” obligations and will likely bring their own actions if EPA and the upwind states fail to do so. The 2015 Ozone NAAQS’s requirements will therefore continue to reverberate and be litigated for years to come.

At least 81 people, including 28 children, died in catastrophic flooding in Central Texas that occurred following record rainfall.
Since January, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps people before, during and after disasters, has lost more than 20 percent of its permanent staff — its most experienced, field-ready responders.
Yes, we do need to modernize, but recovery isn’t a handoff, it’s a partnership.
Events that once allowed for hours or days of warning can now evolve much faster, leaving families, emergency responders and emergency managers with fewer options and less margin for error.","When a flash flood inundates your town or a wildfire devours your neighborhood, you expect the federal government to show up — fast, focused and fully mobilized. That expectation underpins our national resilience. But today, that system is cracking. The help Americans rely on in their darkest hours is in danger of arriving late, underpowered or not at all.

The early morning of Friday brought a fresh reminder of what is at stake. At least 81 people, including 28 children, died in catastrophic flooding in Central Texas that occurred following record rainfall. In just four hours, the amount of rain that typically falls over four months fell — upward of 15 inches in some parts of the region — triggering flash floods that swept away cars, washed out roads and submerged parts of a summer camp and entire neighborhoods. Emergency responders carried out desperate water rescues as rivers surged beyond their banks.

The devastation struck a region still reeling from earlier flooding this spring, which had already prompted a major disaster declaration from President Trump. Recovery from that storm is far from over.

These are not isolated incidents; we now live in an era of climate change with faster, stronger and less predictable storms. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, now warns of “rapid intensification,” when tropical systems quickly escalate from mild to major hurricanes in a matter of hours. That compresses the time emergency managers have to evacuate communities, marshal resources and respond. It leaves less room for error and demands more from the systems that protect us. And yet, the very system designed to meet this moment is being hollowed out.

The uncomfortable truth is this: With each passing day, the federal government is becoming less prepared to face the next big disaster. And as the risk grows, the ability to deliver on its vital disaster response mission is shrinking.

I’ve spent over 25 years responding to disasters. I know what it looks like when government rises to the moment, and I know the warning signs when it’s about to fall short. Those signs are flashing now.

Since January, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps people before, during and after disasters, has lost more than 20 percent of its permanent staff — its most experienced, field-ready responders. Thousands of temporary employees remain on the job, but their contracts are running out. These are people trained to work with disaster survivors. FEMA cannot replace them or bring in new talent because of hiring restrictions. Local hires, who were once a flexible, community-based option, now require many slow approvals. FEMA Corps, which was meant to be a pipeline of young Americans trained to support response and recovery efforts, has been defunded. Contracts for evacuation logistics, shelter operations and flood insurance agents have been allowed to expire.

At the same time, the backbone of preparedness — training — was closed down for months. Over 7,000 emergency personnel were locked out of courses that teach them how to respond to mass casualty events, hazardous materials incidents and catastrophic natural disasters. This training isn’t theoretical. It saves lives.

Compounding the crisis is a growing culture of fear and paralysis. FEMA staff members as well as other federal workers now hesitate to make basic decisions, worried that they’ll be punished for acting without clearance. Those on the staff are told to stay in their lanes, even as the work demands flexibility and urgency.

Mr. Trump recently announced his intention to phase out FEMA after the 2025 hurricane season and shift long-term recovery responsibilities to states or other parts of the federal government. That may appeal to those who want a smaller federal footprint, but the reality is that states are not ready to absorb this role.

And that’s the heart of the problem: This isn’t a thoughtful rebalancing of responsibilities. Critical government tasks are being dumped on state and local partners who are without the staffing, funding or infrastructure to succeed. Yes, we do need to modernize, but recovery isn’t a handoff, it’s a partnership. What we’re witnessing isn’t a system evolving. It’s a system unraveling.

The result is a slower, weaker, more fragmented federal response to the very disasters that are becoming more frequent and more complex. It’s not because the people inside these agencies are incapable — but because they are being held back by a system that’s been depleted and tied in knots.

Rebuilding readiness requires urgent federal leadership — not just from FEMA, but across the federal government, from NOAA to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This isn’t about bureaucracy or political turf wars. It’s about whether the federal government will still be there when people need it most.

The tragic loss of dozens of adults and children, including those swept away from a summer camp, underscores the increasing challenge of rapidly appearing, rapidly intensifying storms. Events that once allowed for hours or days of warning can now evolve much faster, leaving families, emergency responders and emergency managers with fewer options and less margin for error.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/07/opinion/07tierney/07tierney-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:27:34.718536
,American Energy,2025-07-07 15:49:51+00:00,PV Tech,Solar PV looks to more nuanced data usage and more robust cybersecurity measures,JP Casey,,,,,https://www.pv-tech.org/solar-pv-looks-to-more-nuanced-data-usage-and-more-robust-cybersecurity-measures/,"“On one hand it’s about the data, but on the other it’s about the software and how it’s able to put together the various data flows,” Suri says.
“This is something that we learned when we introduced our solar database ten or 15 years ago,” explains Suri.
“There was a lot of expectation, and everyone was saying: ‘It’s a pain, we need a better solution’.
Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) CEO Abigail Ross Hopper called the incident a “serious issue”, and Sadot suggests that the solar industry could learn from other sectors, such as banking, where inter-device communication is accepted as part and parcel of operating procedure.
There are ways to create digital systems in ways that are very secure [and solar] legislation hasn’t really reached that point.”","But, as Suri says, collecting this depth of data, and combining it with factors such as macroeconomic conditions, energy prices and electricity generation forecasts, is no simple task for many project managers.

“On one hand it’s about the data, but on the other it’s about the software and how it’s able to put together the various data flows,” Suri says.

“For example, project data historically just needed weather data; now to build a good project – which is typically a combination of PV-plus-storage – you need to have a business model in mind, and your simulation already has to come with some economic data, for example energy prices and the time series of energy prices in your region.”

This is to say nothing of the myriad challenges associated with changing how a project is planned, built and operated; how people are hired for work in this particular industry; and the potential cybersecurity concerns that can arise from more numerical information flowing in and out of solar projects, all of which must be overcome if the solar industry is to optimise its operations.

Dealing with more data

“The simulation starts with solar irradiance data, then it goes to megawatt hours of electricity produced, then you convert it to money [and ask] is this the right way of building the revenue model? Or should I change the technical design, or my business model,” says Suri, describing the data-collection work of Solargis, and how this information needs to be fed into a wider business case for a project, and then assessed.

“It’s more about complexity and having tools which can support your complex decision-making process.”

However, he notes that this increasing complexity is nothing new for the solar industry; while the recent push for more granular weather data, or more specialised information on the performance of particular solar assets in distinct markets are new phenomena, the core idea of collecting more information to make a more informed decision about a project is nothing new.

“This is something that we learned when we introduced our solar database ten or 15 years ago,” explains Suri. “There was a lot of expectation, and everyone was saying: ‘It’s a pain, we need a better solution’. But when that moment comes, everyone suddenly sees the burden of absorbing the change and transforming the company, the teams and the people, and how they use the existing solutions.”

“First, you need to get some level of confidence that this – what is offered – gives you real benefits,” he continues, suggesting that if a developer can be made aware of the financial benefits of incorporated more sophisticated data into their projects, it can be much easier for them to support the initiative.

“At DNV we are really well prepared,” adds Juan Carlos Arévalo, CEO at GreenPowerMonitor, which provides software solutions to manage renewable energy assets, and is owned by DNV. He told PV Tech Premium that this greater appetite for data, and working with information in a more sophisticated way, has encouraged DNV to hire more than 500 “cyber experts”.

“The teams, which are in project development, need to recruit people who are skilled in various areas,” agrees Suri, suggesting that dealing with more nuanced data is not simply about existing asset managers learning how to use the wealth of information now available, but bringing data experts into the solar space.

“Selling electricity today applies a combination of power purchase agreement (PPA) and direct participation on the energy market, which means that you need to have people who understand short-term forecasting. You need more people to understand various things, and they need better data and better software.”

A growing cybersecurity challenge

When asked about the growing complexity of data in solar asset management, Uri Sadot, cybersecurity programme director at inverter producer SolarEdge and cybersecurity lead at SolarPower Europe, suggested that a greater depth and complexity of data being stored at solar projects presents a cybersecurity risk, as this information could be attractive to potential hackers.

“S&P Global Commodities said cybersecurity is one of the top three trends in 2025 for inverters,” said Sadot, adding: “We’re seeing it across the board, from customers to regulators to vendors.”

“There is no way of escaping this,” agrees Suri. “In certain markets, like the US, they’re effectively there, and in Europe, we’re approaching [that].

“With the blackout in Spain and Portugal, we clearly see that PV needs to more proactively support the grid,” he continues, referring to April’s blackout that was, at one point, thought to have been a cyberattack, before this was ruled out by the Spanish energy minister. “You cannot be a simple power generator, we need to offer grid-supporting or grid-forming services, which are not only technical [decisions] but also financial and business [decisions]; we need to have business models that attract this.”

When asked why this has become such a priority in recent years, Sadot says there are two key reasons: the penetration of solar power to the world’s “big leagues” and awareness-raising done by bodies such as SolarPower Europe.

“Part of it is the maturation of the industry; ten years ago, the penetration in terms of the contribution to the energy mix [was smaller],” he says. A report into European solar cybersecurity published by DNV and SolarPower Europe earlier this year found that the rapid pace of solar project deployment had made it challenging for legislators to keep up with new policies to support the breadth and depth of these projects.

“Across countries in Europe, it’s getting to critical thresholds [which] means that – we may talk about what happened in Spain and Portugal – it’s a big contributor to the overall mix, which imposes new levels of reliability and responsibility for the vendors.

“Number two is a lot of awareness-raising work that’s been done, by SolarPower Europe and some of the vendors, and maybe the global atmosphere – [for example] the war in Ukraine and America pulling out of Europe – where there’s this level of concern that hasn’t existed in the past,” adds Sadot.

“I would say we face more than 2,000 cyberattacks per minute, every day, so we are really well-protected,” says Arévalo, highlighting the scale of the challenge. “We have our own cybersecurity team, protecting the solutions. We play the role of data custodian for our customers, so we cannot afford to have a failure. We are following all the standards, and I think we are quite well-protected.”

‘Hard technical truths’

However, Sadot notes that there are some “hard technical truths” about the current setup of devices and components used in solar projects that present some inherent vulnerabilities from a cybersecurity perspective.

“The concern about cybersecurity is that there are some hard technical truths,” he says. “Solar systems can be controlled remotely in residential and commercial settings. Typically, they’re controlled in central places, and that’s the technical reality of the architecture of inverters, how they’ve matured bottom-up without regulation.

“You have these potential single points of failure that now have more and more power and responsibility that’s been placed on them; if you managed one of these servers ten years ago, who cares, but today you’re a critical infrastructure operator,” Sadot continues, who goes on to describe the question of who has access to these servers as a “political question”.

“I’m not a political expert – I can talk about the architecture – but we know from other industries that architecture that is centralised is very attractive to hackers and criminals, setting aside political motivations. If you can threaten downtime and disruption of servers, as we’ve seen in Ukraine as part of the war [where] you’ve seen data wipes, a criminal will have a lever, and will say: ‘give us a ransom payment’.”

However, he does not say this to be downbeat about the solar industry, or to suggest that optimising operations to help meet the world’s climate goals will always bring security risk for operations, which is simply the cost of doing business in the modern day. He says this to make it clear that these are vulnerabilities that the industry is aware of, and actively working to fix.

Taking the burden off customers

Fixing these vulnerabilities could be key, particularly in the residential sector, where interest in the sector has slowed in Europe. Figures from SolarPower Europe show that Europe added just 5GW of new residential solar capacity in 2024, down from 12.8GW in 2023, and Sadot suggests that a lack of coherent cybersecurity legislation has made it challenging for consumers to feel confident that their projects will not be attacked.

“My philosophy is that a homeowner, like my aunt, should not be expected to know anything about cyber,” he explains, calling for more coherent legislation to take the cybersecurity burden off customers, particularly in the wake of the DNV-SolarPower Europe report that suggests that, at the very least, policymakers are aware of the need to work faster. “It’s better not to open phishing SMS messages and not have the same password for everything for ten years, but I think the real responsibility is on regulators, companies and businesses.”

“There hasn’t been a regulation setting what they should be, and you see different vendors have very different levels. Imagine if each car vendor individually decided whether they put in a seatbelt or an airbag. You can imagine that, say, Volkswagen would make a responsible choice, but others would not, they’d look to compete on price and quality, and that’s what we’re seeing in the inverter space.”

Inverters, in particular, have been a source of cybersecurity concerns recently, following the finding of ‘rogue’ communication devices found in Chinese-made inverters in the US. Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) CEO Abigail Ross Hopper called the incident a “serious issue”, and Sadot suggests that the solar industry could learn from other sectors, such as banking, where inter-device communication is accepted as part and parcel of operating procedure.

“When you manage these systems – these fleets of devices – there are fairly well-established best practices,” he says. “There’s a reason we all trust our online banking app. There are ways to create digital systems in ways that are very secure [and solar] legislation hasn’t really reached that point.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/67B9CF3C-06A8-415B-9B46-648D31DD9D6C-14618-00000230CBF3899A1.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 14:24:52.986059

Strengthening the clean energy workforce is about more than meeting job demand.","(NewsUSA) - The path to a sustainable energy future hinges not only on wind, solar, and battery storage systems—but also on the skilled individuals who build, maintain, and operate them. A diverse, well-trained workforce is essential to the future of clean energy. Yet, too often, investments focus exclusively on technology, overlooking the people who make these innovations possible.

Clean energy currently provides direct, indirect, and induced good-paying jobs for approximately 1.4 million Americans. Roles such as wind turbine technicians and solar installers rank among the fastest-growing careers in the nation. Consider the case of wind turbine technicians: these professionals install, maintain, and repair turbines, ensuring energy continues to flow with minimal downtime. Entry into the field requires no prior degree or experience, and a starting salary between $45,000 and $65,000 is achievable after just 6–8 weeks of basic safety and technical training, followed by on-the-job training for in-field application of skills. These facts underscore the clean energy sector’s capacity to offer accessible and upwardly mobile careers, often times in rural and disadvantaged areas.

Veterans also play a particularly vital role in this transition, comprising 9% of the clean energy workforce—a figure higher than the average for other industries. With leadership, discipline, and technical expertise developed through service, veterans are uniquely positioned to succeed in clean energy roles.

Despite clean energy jobs now outpacing fossil fuel roles nearly three to one, continued progress depends on sustained investment in workforce development. Scaling training programs across a range of skills—from welding and electrical work to trouble-shooting and project management—is essential. Prioritizing underserved populations, including veterans, women, rural communities, and traditional energy workers, will help ensure that the energy transition is both equitable and robust.

Federal and state leaders are elevating workforce development as a national priority, especially for skilled trades. Earlier this year, the White House issued executive orders elevating programming for career and technical education and directing federal agencies to expand pathways to high-paying trade jobs of the future. And at the state level, workforce development remains a key policy focus, with bipartisan support for expanding career and technical education programs.

Strengthening the clean energy workforce is about more than meeting job demand. It is a catalyst for regional revitalization, economic opportunity, and enhanced national competitiveness. The clean energy future is not a distant goal—it is being realized now, through the efforts of skilled technicians, engineers, and project managers across the country. To power that future, bold alignment across policy, education, and industry is required—not just in support of equipment, but in support of the people who make it all possible.",https://wwwcache.wral.com/favicons/favicon-48x48.png,N,,2025-07-07 12:24:32.804625

Mamdani made anti-fossil fuels central to his “affordability” plan for NYC

Inside Climate News/Lauren Dalban

Zohran Mamdani, the official Democratic mayoral primary winner in New York City, has integrated climate change solutions into his affordability-focused campaign, emphasizing improved quality of life for New Yorkers. While not the central theme, his platform addresses the climate crisis through policies like supporting Local Law 97 to reduce carbon emissions from city buildings and opposing polluting natural gas infrastructure. Mamdani’s vision includes a rent freeze for stabilized apartments, free city buses, universal childcare, city-owned grocery stores, and building 200,000 affordable housing units to tackle the city’s high living costs, exemplified by the $4,025 average monthly rent for a one-bedroom. He defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the primary with 56 percent of the vote under the ranked-choice system and will face Mayor Eric Adams and others in the November general election. Mamdani’s climate-smart approach aims to make New York a model for sustainable urban living. [MDN: What you need to know about Mamdani is that he (a) is a full-throated Communist, (b) is anti-fossil fuel, including anti-natural gas, and (c) will never win the November election to become Mayor.

Did Louisiana just become America’s first energy sanctuary state?

RealClearEnergy/Larry Behrens

Louisiana has enacted Act 462, dubbed the “Energy Independence Act,” a groundbreaking law prioritizing affordable, reliable, and domestically produced energy over unreliable renewable mandates, in stark contrast to states like California, Hawaii, and Massachusetts, which suffer from skyrocketing electricity rates—228%, 142%, and 137% above the national average, respectively—due to strict Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and the closure of fossil fuel plants. Louisiana’s law defines dispatchable, reliable energy in statute, emphasizing sources that stabilize the grid, avoid foreign dependence, and keep costs low, with the state enjoying electricity rates 9% below the national average. By rejecting the “Green New Scam” and its reliance on intermittent, foreign-sourced renewables like Chinese solar panels, Louisiana sets a model for energy policy that prioritizes working families and economic stability, urging other states to follow its lead in favoring merit-based energy competition over political agendas. [MDN: Go Louisiana! Smart policies by smart people. Kick unreliable renewable subsidies to the curb. Renewables lose against fossil energy every time there is an even playing field.]

US refiners rely on shale more than ever as heavy oil supplies dwindle

Bloomberg/Lucia Kassai

American refiners are increasingly relying on light shale oil from major U.S. basins like Texas, New Mexico, and North Dakota, as supplies of heavier crude from Mexico, Canada, and Venezuela decline due to falling production, trade disputes, and a U.S. ban on Venezuelan oil. Recent government data shows U.S. fuelmakers are processing the lightest oil mix on record, driven by abundant light, sweet crude from domestic shale and global sources like Guyana and the North Sea. This shift has narrowed the price gap between heavy, sour crude and lighter, sweeter varieties from $7.70 to $3.25 per barrel, making shale oil more attractive for refiners like Marathon Petroleum, Valero Energy, and Exxon Mobil. Investments in refinery infrastructure have enabled greater use of domestic shale oil, which is less exposed to geopolitical risks and arrives quickly via pipelines. In 2023, 61% of oil used for gasoline and diesel was domestic, a trend likely to grow if shale remains cost-competitive. [MDN: It’s about darned time we started refining more of our own oil, and rejecting heavier (sour) crude from places like Canada, Mexico, and (most especially) Saudi Arabia.]

EPA puts on leave 139 employees who spoke out against policies under Trump

Associated Press

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) placed 139 employees on administrative leave for signing a “declaration of dissent” criticizing the agency’s deviation from its mission to protect human health and the environment under the Trump administration. The employees, part of a group of over 170 who signed the letter (with about 100 signing anonymously), faced accusations of “unlawfully undermining” the administration’s agenda, which includes cutting environmental funding, rolling back regulations on air pollution, asbestos, and greenhouse gas emissions, and reorganizing the EPA’s research office to reduce its focus on climate change and environmental justice. The EPA’s actions, led by Administrator Lee Zeldin, have drawn comparisons to a similar dissent at the National Institutes of Health, where no retribution occurred. The EPA insists its decisions are informed by career professionals, but the employees’ public criticism highlights tensions over policies projected to cost thousands of lives and billions in economic losses annually.

Trump fired head of Nuclear Regulatory Commission over a “conflict of visions”

RealClearEnergy/Duggan Flanakin

President Donald Trump fired Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner Christopher Hanson, whom he appointed in 2020 and President Biden reappointed in 2024, in a move some deem illegal due to the lack of stated cause, potentially sparking litigation. Speculation suggests a “conflict of visions” over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) mission, with Trump’s May 23 executive order pushing for faster reactor permitting, revised safety limits, and a pro-nuclear culture clashing with Hanson’s focus on the agency’s independence and safety-first approach. Hanson, who threatened legal action, emphasized preserving the NRC’s bipartisan integrity, while critics like the Union of Concerned Scientists warned the firing threatens nuclear safety. Trump’s directive aims to balance safety with economic and national security benefits, aligning with a nuclear revival driven by energy demands from AI and data centers. The NRC faces increased workloads, including licensing fusion energy and microreactors, amid debates over its regulatory pace and independence. [MDN: Leftists don’t have a divine right to stay employed when there is a new person occupying the Executive Branch. They should expect to get fired. Our opinion: Good! He should be fired if he’s not ready to execute (quickly) on Trump’s agenda. Don’t let the door hit ya where the Good Lord split ya on the way out!]

It is time to hold the climate cabal accountable

Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)/Joe Bastardi

In the article “It is time to hold the climate cabal accountable” on CFACT’s website, Joe Bastardi argues that climate change narratives are being weaponized to undermine U.S. interests while allowing nations like China to emit significantly more CO2 without similar restrictions. He criticizes the hypocrisy of climate advocates who push restrictive policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which he sees as a subsidy scheme that limits American exceptionalism, potentially benefiting foreign powers. Bastardi, a meteorologist, denies that CO2 is the primary driver of climate change, citing natural climate variability and the U.S.’s carbon-negative status due to its tree cover absorbing more CO2 than emitted. He calls for a Rand Paul-like investigation to expose the motives behind these climate policies, likening them to COVID narrative tactics, and accuses figures like John Kerry of bullying dissenters. Bastardi urges accountability for what he perceives as a deliberate agenda to weaken the U.S. economy. [MDN: Let’s turn the tables, call these climate jerks to Congressional hearings, put them under oath, and if they lie, put them in jail for perjury.]

US overtakes Russia as EU number two gas source

Rigzone/Jov Onsat

In the first quarter of 2025, the United States overtook Russia as the European Union’s second-largest natural gas supplier, following the expiration of Russian pipeline gas imports via Ukraine, according to the European Commission. The EU imported 69 billion cubic meters of gas, with pipeline gas constituting 55% (38 Bcm) and LNG 45% (31 Bcm). Norway led as the top supplier with 31% (21.7 Bcm), followed by the U.S. at 24% (16.6 Bcm), and Russia at 14% (9.7 Bcm). Russian gas imports dropped significantly, with pipeline volumes down 45% quarter-on-quarter and 39% year-on-year, while LNG imports remained stable. EU gas consumption rose 8% year-on-year to 119 Bcm, driven by colder temperatures. Domestic production increased slightly to 8.6 Bcm, and gas storage levels averaged 48% fullness. Wholesale gas prices climbed 9% quarter-on-quarter to €47/MWh, with retail prices up 6%, reflecting lower renewable production and geopolitical tensions. The EU aims to phase out Russian gas imports by 2027, relying on global LNG and enhanced infrastructure. [MDN: Progress, but as we’ve seen before, progress can quickly change the other way. We predict the Euroweenies will never end their dependence on Russian gas. They’re addicted.]

Oil slips as US plans Iran talks

Bloomberg/Mia Gindis, Catherine Cartier

Oil prices fell after Axios reported that the US plans to resume nuclear talks with Iran, easing concerns about escalating Middle East tensions. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 0.7% to $67.00 a barrel, and Brent settled at $68.80, following news of a planned meeting between US Middle East envoy Steven Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Oslo. This development, coupled with Iran’s commitment to engage with the UN’s nuclear watchdog, reduced the geopolitical risk premium in oil prices. Despite earlier price gains driven by strong US jobs data, low liquidity ahead of the July 4th holiday, and a stronger dollar, crude was weighed down. The US also imposed new sanctions on Iranian oil trade. Meanwhile, OPEC+ is expected to discuss a 411,000 barrel-a-day production increase, though analysts predict softer demand and potential output adjustments if prices fall significantly, with additional supply risks from a Canadian wildfire near Fort McMurray. [MDN: Donald Trump has brought Iran to heel. Democrat media will never admit it, but observant people know the truth.

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-07 15:35:58+00:00,Maine Beacon - A project of the Maine People's Alliance,"Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' is bad news for Maine clean energy",Chris D’Angelo for The Maine Monitor,,,,,https://mainebeacon.com/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-bad-news-for-maine-clean-energy/,"The average household’s monthly bill is expected to jump by about $5, or 3.3 percent, one year after a roughly $10 monthly increase.
The Senate narrowly passed its version of President Donald Trump’s so-called “one big, beautiful” bill Tuesday, followed by the House on Thursday.
On the energy front, the legislation aims to thwart the nation’s build out of clean energy, including wind and solar, while incentivizing coal, oil and gas production.
Collins cited the bill’s clean energy rollbacks in a statement explaining her ‘no’ vote.
The budget megabill could lead to a loss of 760,000 jobs nationally by 2030 and average household energy costs increasing $170 per year over the next decade according to a recent analysis from Energy Innovations, an energy and climate think tank.","On Tuesday morning, hundreds of thousands of Mainers woke up to higher electricity bills. Central Maine Power’s rate hike, its second in as many years, was largely driven by the utility’s need to recover costs from severe storms in the last few years — the type of extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent and severe due to global climate change. The average household’s monthly bill is expected to jump by about $5, or 3.3 percent, one year after a roughly $10 monthly increase.

As Mainers prepared to reach deeper into their bank accounts to help bankroll the mounting impacts of fossil fuel-driven climate change on energy infrastructure, Republicans in Congress advanced a massive budget bill that is likely to further drive up energy costs and deliver a blow to renewable energy projects, energy efficiency programs and climate action in Maine and across the country.

The Senate narrowly passed its version of President Donald Trump’s so-called “one big, beautiful” bill Tuesday, followed by the House on Thursday. The legislation now heads to Trump’s desk. On the energy front, the legislation aims to thwart the nation’s build out of clean energy, including wind and solar, while incentivizing coal, oil and gas production.

In its current form, the bill would rapidly phase out Biden administration-era tax credits for wind and solar projects, requiring those projects to either break ground within one year or come online by the end of 2027 to access the credits; eliminate tax credits for new and used electric vehicles purchased after Sept. 30 of this year; repeal Inflation Reduction Act funding for numerous emission-reduction programs; and terminate tax credits for home energy efficiency upgrades, including rooftop solar, electric heat pumps and insulation, at the end of 2025.

“The passage of this bill is going to raise prices for consumers, it is going to cut wages for workers and it’s going to make us more reliant on natural gas, which is incredibly expensive right now,” Scott Cuddy, a former state representative and current director of membership development at the the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 1253, told The Maine Monitor. “We’re just looking at losing, losing and losing.”

Maine’s entire congressional delegation — Sens. Susan Collins (R) and Angus King (I) and Reps. Chellie Pingree (D) and Jared Golden (D) — voted against the package. Collins cited the bill’s clean energy rollbacks in a statement explaining her ‘no’ vote.

“The tax credits that energy entrepreneurs have relied on should have been gradually phased out so as not to waste the work that has already been put into these innovative new projects and prevent them from being completed,” she said. “The bill should have also retained incentives for Maine families who choose to install heat pumps and residential solar panels.”

Ahead of the Senate vote, dozens of Maine organizations, businesses, community leaders and labor unions sent a letter urging the two Senators to oppose the bill’s proposed cuts to clean energy investments.

Anya Fetcher, federal policy advocate at the Natural Resource Council of Maine, one of the organizations that signed onto the letter, noted that the bill threatens to slow Maine’s transition to local renewable energy and in turn “prolong the amount of time it takes to drive down energy costs for households and for Maine to reach its [climate] goals.”

The Republican push to get Trump’s policy agenda across the finish line comes on the heels of Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signing into law a bill to speed up the state’s transition away from polluting energy sources, with a new target of reaching 100 percent clean electricity by 2040.

To date, clean energy funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, both of which were passed during the Biden administration, have supported nearly $3 billion in direct and public-private investments in Maine, according to NRCM’s analysis of data from Rhodium Group’s Clean Investment Monitor.

The budget megabill could lead to a loss of 760,000 jobs nationally by 2030 and average household energy costs increasing $170 per year over the next decade according to a recent analysis from Energy Innovations, an energy and climate think tank.

In Maine, 1,600 jobs are forecast to evaporate and average household energy costs are expected to rise $80 per year by 2035, Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovation and one of the authors of the report, told The Maine Monitor after crunching state-level data.

“Maine already has quite high power prices,” O’Brien said in an email. “But by passing a renewable standard last month, the legislature is effectively shielding Mainers from some of the price spikes and volatility of imported thermal fuels. Sure, the cost of adding new renewables will go up due to repealed tax credits, but there will be so much less gas and petroleum use on the grid that power prices won’t increase to quite the same degree as in states with heavy grid fossil reliance.”

Yet Maine began feeling impacts of the GOP budget bill well before this week’s legislative battle on Capitol Hill, with at least two planned solar projects — a 100 megawatt facility in Cherryfield and a 140-megawatt array in Hartland — being put on hold and hours for union electricians quickly drying up, according to Cuddy.

Given the climate threat that Maine and the rest of the country is facing, Cuddy views the legislation as worse than the old idiom “cutting off your nose to spite your face.”

“We’re like blasting our nose off our face,” he said. “We’re using TNT up each nostril to blow our nose off of our face here. We are injuring ourselves economically in the short term, and in the long term we are making the problem that is causing some of our economic woes even worse. The bill just confounds me.”

“We’ve been working to sell people on this concept of win, win, win: We fight climate change, we create good jobs, we help the environment and we save people money,” he added. “That’s what we’re doing away with.”",https://mainebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Susan-Collins-062025.webp,N,,2025-07-07 12:24:39.059160

Conventional energy sources currently make up 77% of the region’s energy mix. Energy demand is also expected to remain strong over the coming 25 years, as reported by this news service.

In March 2025, the US said it is withdrawing from the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) – an accord between various wealthy nations to help develop the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy.

The withdrawal is likely to add further pressure for emerging markets and developing economies, including those within Southeast Asia.

Quoting Amy Kong, a researcher at Zero Carbon Analytics, the Financial Times says governments should focus on finding solutions that can catalyse private investments, as the JETP and other programs cannot be soled relied upon.

Multilateral financing, which plays a big role in climate financing in the region, is slowing as US President Donald Trump retreats from climate goals and reduces America’s aid globally, but bilateral public finance could help, the Financial Times reports Kong as saying.

Southeast Asia accounts for 9% of the world’s population, 6% of global GDP, and 4% of world energy consumption. Yet the region’s spending on clean energy represents only 2% of the global total.

The annual average energy investment from Southeast Asia over the past three years totals US$72 billion ($110.50 billion), but will need to increase to more than US$130 billion to align with the Announced Pledges Scenario and in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario by the end of the decade.

This is according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which adds there will also need to be a shift in the allocation of investment towards cleaner technologies – clean power would be the largest share of investment – nearly 40%.

The region’s population is forecasted to grow to nearly 800 million by 2050. Coupled with continued economic growth, this is expected to have strong implications for world energy demand.

Past and future energy investment in Southeast Asia

The IEA says investment flow imbalances, particularly insufficient clean energy investment outside China, means many of the least-developed economies are being left behind when it comes to clean energy.

Investment will determine how this rising demand is met, with implications for security, affordability and alignment with sustainability goals.

Eight out of 10 countries in the region have announced target dates of carbon neutrality: Singapore, Malaysia and four others in 2050; Indonesia in 2060; and Thailand in 2065.

In 2024, the share of global clean energy investment in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDE) outside China was expected to remain around 15% of the total.

Both in terms of volume and share, the IEA says this is far below the amounts that are required to ensure full access to modern energy and to meet rising energy demand in a sustainable way.

“Investment in energy efficiency and electrification in buildings and industry has been quite resilient, despite the economic headwinds. But most of the dynamism in the end-use sectors is coming from transport, where investment is set to reach new highs in 2024 (+8% compared to 2023), driven by strong electric vehicle (EV) sales,” the IEA reports.

“The rise in clean energy spending is underpinned by emissions reduction goals, technological gains, energy security imperatives (particularly in the European Union), and an additional strategic element: major economies are deploying new industrial strategies to spur clean energy manufacturing and establish stronger market positions.

“Such policies can bring local benefits, although gaining a cost-competitive foothold in sectors with ample global capacity like solar PV can be challenging. Policy makers need to balance the costs and benefits of these programmes so that they increase the resilience of clean energy supply chains while maintaining gains from trade.”

The hybrid renaissance While pure electric vehicle sales face challenges at Ford, the company's hybrid offerings are experiencing remarkable growth.","The electric vehicle landscape underwent significant transformation in the second quarter of 2025, with traditional automakers gaining ground against market leader Tesla. As competition intensifies and consumer preferences evolve, the EV market is experiencing a redistribution of market share that could signal longer-term industry trends.

Tesla's continued decline

Tesla, long the dominant force in electric vehicles, reported a substantial 13.5% drop in global vehicle deliveries for Q2 2025 compared to the same period last year. The company delivered 384,122 vehicles worldwide, falling short of analysts' expectations of 387,000 units, according to the Wall Street Journal.

This marks Tesla's second consecutive quarterly decline, following a 13% drop in Q1 and its first annual delivery decrease in over a decade last year. The company's automotive revenue has been significantly impacted, with a 20% plunge reported in the first quarter, WSJ notes.

Industry analysts attribute Tesla's struggles to several factors:

WSJ reports that Tesla executives have downplayed these concerns, instead highlighting potential growth opportunities through investments in autonomous driving technology and the Optimus humanoid robot project.

GM's electric acceleration

In stark contrast to Tesla's decline, General Motors reported remarkable growth in its EV business. The automaker's electric vehicle sales more than doubled in Q2, reaching 46,280 units—a 111% year-over-year increase.

This impressive performance continues GM's strong momentum in the electric segment. The company sold approximately 114,000 EVs in the US last year and has already delivered around 78,000 units in the first half of 2025, capturing approximately 13% of the American electric vehicle market.

The Chevrolet Equinox EV has emerged as the star performer in GM's expanding electric lineup, with over 27,000 units sold in the first half of 2025. Priced at $34,995 with more than 300 miles of range, the Equinox EV has surpassed the Ford Mustang Mach-E to become the best-selling non-Tesla electric vehicle in America, Inside EVs reports.

GM's luxury brand Cadillac has also made significant inroads, becoming the luxury EV market share leader in Q2. New models like the Cadillac Escalade IQ and Optiq are gaining traction, with 1,810 and 1,744 units sold in Q2, respectively.

With a portfolio now encompassing 11 electric models, GM's EV market share has reached 16%—approaching its overall market share of 17%.

Ford's EV challenges

Ford experienced a difficult quarter for its electric vehicle division, with sales plummeting 31.4% in Q2 2025. Bloomberg reports the company delivered just 16,438 electric vehicles during this period, with significant declines across its EV lineup.

The Mustang Mach-E, Ford's flagship electric SUV, saw sales fall 19.5% to 10,178 vehicles. The situation was exacerbated by a stop-sale order issued due to a safety flaw that could potentially trap occupants inside the vehicle. Ford recalled approximately 317,000 Mach-E models to address a software defect, according to Bloomberg.

The F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck also struggled, with deliveries dropping 26.1% to 5,842 units. The E-Transit electric van experienced the steepest decline, with sales plummeting 88% to just 418 vehicles—only 97 of which were sold in May.

Ford attributed these disappointing results to the Mach-E stop-sale order and inventory shortages caused by factory shutdowns for model-year changeovers. ""Our dealers can't sell what they don't have,"" a company spokesperson told Bloomberg, expressing expectations that Mustang Mach-E inventory would increase throughout July.

The hybrid renaissance

While pure electric vehicle sales face challenges at Ford, the company's hybrid offerings are experiencing remarkable growth. Inside EVs reports that Ford reported record electrified vehicle sales of 156,059 units in the first half of 2025, with hybrid sales jumping 27% year-over-year to over 117,000 vehicles.

Models like the F-150 Hybrid and Maverick Hybrid are driving this surge in hybrid popularity, according to Inside EVs. This trend extends beyond Ford, with Hyundai and Kia also reporting increased hybrid and plug-in hybrid sales despite slight declines in their pure EV deliveries.

The resurgence of hybrid technology, after years of stagnation, suggests that many consumers still prefer the flexibility of vehicles that combine internal combustion engines with electric propulsion rather than committing to fully electric models.

Market implications

The second quarter results reveal a market in transition. While the overall U.S. EV market contracted by approximately 6% in Q2 according to Cox Automotive data cited by Inside EVs, the redistribution of market share indicates evolving consumer preferences and competitive dynamics.

""But while Tesla pulls back, GM is stepping up,"" noted Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights, as reported by Inside EVs. ""So while the overall market is softening, the story beneath the surface is one of redistribution.""

This redistribution may accelerate as traditional automakers continue to expand their electric offerings. GM's success demonstrates that well-executed electric vehicles from established brands can gain significant market traction, even as the overall EV market experiences growing pains.

Ford's struggles highlight the challenges of transitioning to electric vehicles, particularly when safety issues arise. Bloomberg reports that the company is now overhauling its EV strategy to focus on affordable models starting under $30,000, though these won't launch until 2027.

As the EV landscape continues to evolve, manufacturers must navigate changing consumer preferences, technological challenges, and an increasingly competitive marketplace. The coming quarters will reveal whether Tesla can reverse its decline, if GM can sustain its momentum, and whether Ford can overcome its current obstacles to regain ground in the electric vehicle race.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltec0249a015ba8b29/67d45ec26523128265369641/2024-Chevrolet-Equinox-EV-004.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-07 13:26:01.962046

The mine developer’s stock was at $2.38 apiece despite wider markets falling on Monday in Toronto, still the company’s highest value in nearly five years. That compared with $1.92 each before the announcement on Friday. The company has a market capitalization of $1.26 billion.

The company said it’s in talks with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding litigation. It had filed two separate actions in the federal courts in March to challenge the EPA’s role in blocking the proposed Pebble mine. Once built, it would be North America’s largest copper, gold and molybdenum extraction site.

The EPA, in a July 3 filing, confirmed that it is “open to reconsideration” and welcomes further submissions by Northern Dynasty that may be used to reverse its decision. The parties “currently expect to reach agreement within the next two weeks about what that submission would entail,” the EPA stated.

The discussion with the EPA presents “the fastest path forward” to withdraw the Pebble project veto, Northern Dynasty President and CEO Ron Thiessen said in a news release Friday. The agency has “asked for additional information to assist in finalizing that decision,” he said.

Waste storage

In January 2023, the EPA dealt a blow to the project by prohibiting mine waste storage in the Bristol Bay watershed, site of some of the world’s largest sockeye salmon fisheries. The agency argued that the mine waste could permanently destroy more than 2,000 acres (about 800 hectares) of wetlands protected by the Clean Water Act.

Northern Dynasty claimed the EPA veto contradicted the environmental impact statement published by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in July 2020. Removing the veto would allow the Corps, which has its own approvals process, to revisit its refusal.

A decision to withdraw the EPA veto would help the U.S. to secure a domestic supply of metals such as copper, which is in high demand globally for its use in electrification, and rhenium, a key component in military applications, Thiessen said. The project also holds substantial amounts of gold, molybdenum and silver.

According to a 2023 economic study, the Pebble mine would produce 6.4 billion lb. of copper, 7.4 million oz. of gold, 300 million lb. of molybdenum, 37 million oz. of silver and 200,000 kg of rhenium over 20 years.",,N,,2025-07-07 12:25:48.773981

Congressman Dan Meuser, Congressional District 9, has released a public statement after voting in favor of H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). The legislation passed on the afternoon of July 3 with a 218 to 214 vote before being sent to President Trump for final approval.

The following is Congressman Meuser's full statement.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill is a direct response to what the American people have demanded — secure borders, lower costs, greater opportunity, and an accountable government that works for them, not against them.

This bill makes permanent the tax relief passed in President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and prevents the largest tax increase in American history. If Congress did not pass the OBBB, we’d be guaranteeing a $4 trillion tax hike on the American people — raising taxes on 165 million taxpayers and over 33 million small businesses.

For families in Pennsylvania, this bill’s passage means avoiding a $2,500 tax hike, preserving the full $30,000 standard deduction, and expanding the Child Tax Credit to $2,200 for 1.4 million Pennsylvania households. For small businesses — which make up 99.6% of Pennsylvania employers — it makes permanent immediate R&D expensing, 100% bonus depreciation, and the 20% small business deduction, protecting more than 960,000 job creators across the Commonwealth. It also protects 49,000 family-owned farms in the Commonwealth from having their Estate Tax exemption reduced by half.

The OBBB supports working families in every corner of the country. It eliminates taxes on tips and overtime through 2028, creates a $6,000 senior deduction, and launches Trump Investment Accounts for every child born between 2025 and 2028—giving families a stake in our nation’s economic future from day one.

As well, it secures our border by completing the physical barrier, expanding personnel, and giving ICE and Border Patrol the resources they need to do their job. It unleashes American energy by ending costly mandates, repealing wasteful subsidies, restarting lease sales, and restarting domestic production. And it puts our budget on a more sustainable path—delivering $1.2 trillion in mandatory savings, the largest deficit reduction package in nearly 30 years.

And importantly, this bill strengthens Medicaid for those it was intended to support. It includes common-sense work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, removes individuals who are ineligible under the law from the rolls, and, beginning in October 2026, it ends the federal cost-share for states that choose to include illegal immigrants in their Medicaid programs—taking serious steps to address waste, fraud, and abuse in the program. It also delivers support for rural healthcare, creating a $50 billion fund to help rural hospitals and ensure continued access to care. We’re making Medicaid more sustainable, more accountable, and more focused on delivering real results for seniors, the disabled, and low-income families.

The Big Beautiful Bill is essential to correcting course for our country, but it is just the beginning of our work to make America as great as it can be. It restores fiscal sanity, economic certainty, and puts the needs of American families and businesses first. It reflects the America First agenda we were elected to deliver — and now, it heads to President Trump’s desk to be signed into law.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/d8/4d805ea7-afa6-52c6-aecc-eb092330e792/686a935264226.image.jpg?crop=1000%2C525%2C0%2C27,N,,2025-07-07 16:27:50.905200

In this article, I’m attempting to present an optimistic view of the US auto market after the passage of the bill that ends electric vehicle (EV) tax credits on September 30th. That ended up being pretty hard to do, since there is a lot in the bill (and other actions) that reduces incentives for electric cars and trucks.

Incentives Changing

The $7,500 EV credit for new vehicles ends September 30th.

The $4,000 used EV credit ends at the same time, as we discussed here.

The commercial clean vehicles credit (used heavily as the “leasing loophole“) also ends at the same time.

The ZEV credits aren’t eliminated, but since the penalties go to zero, nobody is going to worry about meeting the goals.

Battery manufacturing credits are staying, but there are new complicated sourcing restrictions which will be difficult to qualify for.

Third Quarter Rush To Buy Before The Incentives End

Historically, whenever incentives end with some warning, this has the effect of pulling demand into the last quarter the incentives are available from the first quarter the incentives aren’t available. I haven’t seen much chatter about this yet on my social media feeds, and I expect that to change as we get closer to the deadline. Talking to my friends, it seems like everyone is disappointed that electric cars became so political.

First the Democrats liked Tesla but they were pricey.

Then Tesla cars got less expensive and many people were mad they hurt the resale value of their cars.

Then other brands adopted Tesla’s NACS port and were allowed to use the Tesla Supercharger network.

Then Elon became a Republican and half my friends started to hate Tesla but my Republican friends start buying them.

Then Elon started fighting with Trump and now nobody but the fanboys seems to like Tesla.

Now most of the incentives are ending soon and most are confused where things are going — hence I thought I’d write this article to organize my thoughts.

Tesla

Tesla sales in the US are down, but it is still the largest seller of electric cars by far, so let’s start with how it will impact the company’s sales. Tesla was expected to introduce more affordable models by the end of the second quarter, but didn’t (unless you consider the RWD CyberTruck and RWD Model Y, but most people were looking for a $25,000 or $30,000 vehicle to expand the total addressable market). Half the people I’ve followed thought it would just be a bare-bones Model Y, while half thought it would be more compact model. I think both are correct, but the timing will likely be different. I wrote here two months ago how Tesla could reduce prices a lot without making it smaller. They need a smaller vehicle for non-US markets where roads and parking favor smaller cars, but that might not come out till next year.

Whether Tesla delayed the introduction due to tariffs causing them to adjust supply chains or just delays in the design, I don’t know, but I suspect the former, since it isn’t difficult for an organization as talented as Tesla to make a stripped down car. Now, if it is a radical new model, then it could be design delays. But now that the bill has passed, I think Tesla delayed introduction until closer to September 30th, since they expect demand for the existing cars to increase in this quarter. On the other hand, that leaves them with overcapacity in the non-US markets, so I think they won’t wait till October 1st to introduce the vehicle. They just might have relatively high pricing at announcement (maybe $35,000). This won’t make much of a splash, but they may also not bother to get it qualified for the $7,500 tax credit, since it would only be able to use that for a few days. But the interesting thing is that frees up the supply chain if they don’t have to meet all the requirements for the tax credit. Those requirements might add thousands to the cost of the vehicle, so just ignoring those requirements might allow some different design choices. They could use an imported lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery, for example.

Tesla could also plan a release of FSD (not that the company’s record of meeting its goals for FSD has met its previous schedules) to come out in the 4th quarter to soften the blow of losing the tax credit. If Tesla lowered prices $2,500, included an extended trial of FSD that is significantly better than what is available today, and competition is less, that could increase demand enough to counter the loss of the tax credit.

The Big 3 (GM, Ford, Stellantis)

The big 3 Detroit-based automakers have to build EVs for foreign markets, but I see them scaling back their plans for electric vehicles considerably. They will pivot to hybrids, yet not totally give up on electric vehicles, because they have to be ready to build them if Democrats retake the presidency and Congress in 2028. If they were smarter, they would realize they need to make electric cars that are less expensive and better than their gas cars, regardless of US laws and regulations, since that is what their competition will do. But I think they will take the lazy way out and just put money into making gas cars that are 3% better or hybrids that are 30% more efficient. GM and Ford will do more EVs, since they are ahead, but Stellantis may just give up on them domestically.

Rivian & Lucid

I’d love to be wrong, but I don’t know if either of these companies can survive without tax credits. But I’m not sure they could survive with tax credits either.

Hyundai & Kia

Hyundai & Kia seem like they will continue to develop their EVs to service global markets, and I think they will bring most of them to the US. But they will also shift some capacity to hybrids and plug-in hybrids, because that is where the demand will be without the tax credit.

The Japanese

I think Toyota & Honda will sigh a breath of relief and just keep converting their gas cars to hybrids. This is where the demand is and now that they don’t have to worry about penalties, they will delay any introductions of EVs in the US.

The Chinese

This is really the wildcard. Below I have some wild speculation that will change a lot if it happens, but which is unlikely to happen.

Could China send hybrid cars to the US to take advantage of the low 2.5% tariffs, low labor costs, and massive overcapacity? Plug-in hybrids and EVs have high tariffs, but why not ship the gas and hybrid cars that nobody else wants to the US? This is risky, since Trump could issue an executive order at any time to stop this for security reasons, but maybe this could happen later.

Could they sell zero-mile used cars from Mexico? This is also risky for similar reasons, and service and support would be an issue.

Could China make a deal to invest billions in US factories to build cars here? Trump is always looking to attract foreign investment in the US, but is also worried about security concerns. This is risky because Trump changes his mind frequently.

The safest way for China to get cars into the US is do some deal with Trump that makes him look good. Then he would be less likely to change his mind because of his ego.

Conclusion

It seems likely that most manufacturers will stop making compliance cars or cars just to satisfy the regulations or avoid penalties. But most of those cars and trucks weren’t that great anyway. That leaves more market share for those automakers like Tesla and the Koreans (and hopefully others) that are likely to gain market share (not just EV share, but overall market share). The key to success is to make an EV that is better and less expensive than the comparable gas car made by your own company and your competitors. We are seeing that globally and we need to see it more in the US also.

“We emphasize that ensuring accessible, timely and affordable climate finance for developing countries is critical for enabling just transitions pathways that combine climate action with sustainable development,” the group said in its statement. “We underscore that the provision and mobilization of resources under the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement is a responsibility of developed countries towards developing countries.”

This is the default setting of the so-called Global South, which also appears to include countries such as Russia and China, with the world’s wealthiest economies considered the greatest beneficiaries of the industrial age that presumably led to excessive carbon dioxide emissions that need to be brought down urgently.

Yet BRICS also acknowledged that the world is still decades away from giving up oil and gas, especially in its emerging-economy parts. “We acknowledge fossil fuels will still play an important role in the world’s energy mix,” the group said in its joint statement, “particularly for emerging markets and developing economies, and we recognize the need to promote just, orderly, equitable and inclusive energy transitions and reduce GHG emissions in line with our climate goals and observing SDG7, and the principles of technological neutrality and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities taking into account national circumstances, needs and priorities.”

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has threatened additional tariffs of 10% on BRICS members and any country doing business with them, accusing them of “anti-American policies”. “Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump said on Truth Social.

The threat was a response to the BRICS joint statement mentioning tariffs as a disruptive force for global trade, “potentially exacerbating existing economic disparities and affecting prospects for global economic development.”

Wetlands and parts of the city’s levee system are sinking, too.

The geography of New Orleans resembles a bowl, and it’s protected from flooding by a system of earthen levees, concrete flood walls, pumps and canals that took the Army Corps of Engineers nearly 15 years and $15 billion to build. That makes it particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and other environmental stresses.

“Subsidence can compromise protective infrastructure over time,” said Leonard Ohenhen, an expert on remote sensing at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. “I hope we get more work like this, quantifying subsidence over time in cities.”

As levees and flood walls sink, they can crack and accumulate structural damage. They also become shorter, making them less effective against storm surges and rising sea levels. That’s a particularly big concern in New Orleans because the Gulf of Mexico has the fastest sea level rise in the country.

To assess where and how quickly land elevation in New Orleans has changed in recent decades, the authors of the new study, published in the journal Science Advances, used radar collected by satellites over two time periods, from 2002 to 2007 and from 2016 to 2020. In each period, a satellite passed over the city multiple times, letting researchers compare elevations over time. The later time series included the levee system and wetlands. The researchers then compiled a map showing the land’s rising and sinking over time.

Much of the city was stable during the study period, but some hot spots of elevation change — around levees, wetlands, industrial sites and the airport — stood out.

Levees and flood walls are sinking up to 28 millimeters per year, with the fastest rate of levee height loss near the airport and wetlands.

“These rates may affect the flood protection system in the next few decades,” said Simone Fiaschi, a remote sensing expert who led the new study while at Tulane University.

New Orleans’s storm surge protection system was built largely in response to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the city in 2005, killing more than 1,800 people and causing more than $160 billion in damage. Now, with funding cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a month into hurricane season, the city is concerned about its ability to respond to storms.

Some settling is natural after levees and flood walls are installed simply because they’re heavy and the ground is soft.

“In New Orleans, you’re kind of building on pudding,” said Ricky Boyett, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers who was not involved in the study. “If you build anything on that ground, it’s going to sink.”

The new map is useful for identifying spots where settling is either increasing or happening faster than expected. The levees and flood walls were designed to accommodate some future settling, but the measurements will help repair teams prioritize which levees are maintained first.

The New Orleans airport, in the northwestern part of the city between Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River, is one of the fastest-sinking sites, dropping nearly three centimeters, or nearly one inch, per year. Other industrial sites around the city are sinking 20 to 50 millimeters per year.

And wetlands could be sinking three to nearly five centimeters per year, although these results need to be confirmed by on-the-ground measurements, Dr. Fiaschi said. Wetlands’ elevations are notoriously difficult to measure using satellites with radar imagery because of fluctuating water levels and vegetation.

“If the wetlands are subsiding this much, they are slowly dying,” he said. They could disappear within decades, he added, taking with them important ecosystems and buffers of flood water.

Large areas of the city are stable, and some spots are even rising. For example, a former power plant site has been gaining about six millimeters of elevation per year because groundwater pumping stopped.

“One surprising thing was the uplift, which is not usually expected in a city,” Dr. Fiaschi said. “It means that some of this settling can be reversed, at least partially, just by halting the exploitation of water.”

The map from the study gives the city and the Army Corps of Engineers updated, high-resolution information on where the levees will need height added, Mr. Boyett said.

Levees are designed to be continually built up. Flood walls are harder to repair, Mr. Boyett said, but they are sinking less quickly because they are smaller and therefore lighter. Building a taller levee in the first place would require a larger footprint, taking away valuable space in the city.

Responsibility for monitoring, maintaining and repairing all of the flood walls and levees transferred to the state of Louisiana in 2022, but since then, Congress has authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to resume a shared support role and assess what it would take to protect the city from a more extreme flood than the system was originally designed for.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/04/climate/04CLI-NOLA-SINKING/04CLI-NOLA-SINKING-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 12:27:44.174367

“Instead, MISO and SPP merely ask for permission to use more accurate study assumptions.” By rejecting the waiver request, MISO and SPP will have to commit resources towards an inefficient study that prevents them from identifying needed interregional transmission projects, Rosner said.","Dive Brief:

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday rejected a waiver request from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and the Southwest Power Pool that would have allowed the grid operators to expand the scope of their 2024-25 interregional transmission study process.

The waiver would have let MISO and SPP incorporate multiple scenarios in a single 10-year model rather than the multi-year analysis required by their joint operating agreement, FERC said. They would also have been able to use multiple metrics to peg the reliability and public policy value of interregional transmission projects instead of the “cost avoidance of pre-existing regional projects” metric required by the agreement.

FERC Commissioner David Rosner dissented in the 2-1 decision. “The commission should not stand in the way of simple solutions that give MISO, SPP, and their stakeholders flexibility to improve the accuracy of their study,” Rosner said.

Dive Insight:

Under the MISO-SPP joint operating agreement, at least every two years the grid operators are required to conduct a Coordinated System Plan, or CSP, study to find cross-border transmission projects that would benefit them both.

The study process has never identified an interregional project that would benefit both MISO and SPP because of the limited benefit valuations that are outlined in the agreement, according to the grid operators’ Jan. 15 waiver request.

As a result, MISO and SPP proposed to their stakeholders a one-time plan to expand the CSP study scope to identify near-term upgrades that enhance transfer capability and yield multiple benefits across their footprints, they said. The proposal would provide a more comprehensive look at their system needs, according to MISO and SPP.

However, FERC said the request failed to meet its criteria for approving waivers from FERC-approved rules, such as that a waiver be limited in scope.

FERC said the requested waiver wasn’t limited because it would “broadly alter” the scope of the CSP study by no longer evaluating the reliability and public policy benefits of interregional transmission projects as the avoided cost of regional transmission projects that address the same reliability or public policy issue.

Also, the waiver request did not address a concrete problem — one of FERC’s criteria for approving requested waivers — because MISO and SPP didn’t show that expanding the study scope would lead to new transmission.

“While we appreciate MISO’s and SPP’s desire to improve their CSP process, a waiver request is not the appropriate vehicle to achieve such an outcome,” FERC said. Instead, they should ask FERC for permission to change their CSP rules, according to the agency.

In his dissent, Rosner said the waiver would have allowed MISO and SPP to better tailor the CSP study to their regional needs.

“The waiver does not create a new study process; nor does it change project selection criteria or cost allocation provisions,” Rosner said. “Instead, MISO and SPP merely ask for permission to use more accurate study assumptions.”

By rejecting the waiver request, MISO and SPP will have to commit resources towards an inefficient study that prevents them from identifying needed interregional transmission projects, Rosner said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ey2PIukErcoTJ8ndf0TQr2pTq1f6KwxTpzkHtoWt_2I/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTUwMzE2Njc2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-07 12:25:18.312823

Even before the law was passed, the U.S. was already seeing a drop in renewable investment, owing to fears about the future of tax credits.
Since 2000, China has doubled the share of electricity meeting its energy needs, while the U.S. has remained stagnant.
“China will be the world’s first electro-state, the global clean tech hegemon,” said Jesse Jenkins, an energy expert at Princeton.","The Republican spending bill, signed into law Friday, will reset the course for the U.S. energy sector, analyses show. The law rapidly phases out tax credits for wind, solar, and electric cars, while making it cheaper to drill and mine for fossil fuels on federal lands.

The loss of federal support is expected to curb the buildout of wind and solar by more than 70 gigawatts by 2030, driving up household energy costs by $165 per year, according to a new analysis from Princeton University. The loss of the EV tax credit could lead to roughly 8 million fewer plug-in cars sold this decade, according to an earlier Princeton analysis.

Even before the law was passed, the U.S. was already seeing a drop in renewable investment, owing to fears about the future of tax credits. In the first five months of this year, companies canceled more than two dozen projects, with Republican districts losing some 10,000 expected jobs, according to data from E2.

The gutting of federal support for renewable energy defied the predictions of many experts, who believed that Republicans in Congress would preserve tax credits that supported thousands of new clean-tech jobs, mostly in GOP strongholds. In the end, nearly every Republican voted to eliminate the tax credits, with some driving hundreds of miles to Washington to approve the bill after severe weather grounded flights.

With the law’s passage, the U.S. can now expect emissions to drop by just 3 percent by the end of this decade, according to an analysis from CarbonBrief. The U.S. had previously aimed to cut emissions by 40 percent, under the Paris Agreement, though that goal is now defunct. On his first day back in office, President Trump directed the U.S. to exit the climate pact.

The U.S. now finds itself further at odds with the rest of the world. A new report from energy think tank Ember shows that China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and other Asian nations are electrifying far faster than the U.S., meaning they are increasingly relying on electricity, rather than oil, gas, and coal, to fuel cars and supply heat. Since 2000, China has doubled the share of electricity meeting its energy needs, while the U.S. has remained stagnant.

Last year, China installed more than half of all new wind and solar globally while attracting three out of every four dollars invested in clean-tech manufacturing. “China will be the world’s first electro-state, the global clean tech hegemon,” said Jesse Jenkins, an energy expert at Princeton. “Especially as the Republican Party forces the U.S. to leave the field of competition uncontested and dig into our role as petro-state.”

This is because Applied’s suppliers also support other semiconductor companies, multiplying the impact of any shift to cleaner energy.
The report details how Applied collected data from 183 suppliers in 2024, with 109 providing detailed Scope 1 and 2 emissions data.
We also engage a third party to help them calculate their emissions data.","Applied Materials has published its 2024 Impact Report where the semiconductor manufacturer lays out how it is managing the challenge of meeting clean energy targets while building out new facilities to serve a fast-growing tech sector.

Headquartered in California, the company supplies the machinery behind modern electronics, from consumer devices to data centres.

That means it’s not just an energy user – it helps define how energy is consumed in digital systems worldwide.

On the energy front, there is both progress and pressure.

Renewable electricity ramps up but so do emissions

Applied has committed to sourcing 100% of its global electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

So far, the company has reached 73%, with its US operations already running fully on renewables.

These gains are largely thanks to contract changes, off-site purchases and a big push for solar on-site.

In 2024 alone, Applied boosted its total renewable electricity by 11%, including a 48% increase in solar generation at its facilities.

At its Tainan manufacturing site in Taiwan, a 700 kW solar array delivered 228,524 kWh of clean energy in just three months.

Despite the renewable push, Applied’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions—those generated directly and from purchased electricity—are now 4% above its 2019 baseline.

The reason? Construction. New facilities come with short-term carbon costs, from powering up sites to the embedded emissions in materials and equipment.

Still, the company insists it is on the right track.

Writing on LinkedIn, Chris Librie, Chief Sustainability Officer, said: “I’m pleased to share that Applied Materials has published our 2024 Impact Report detailing great progress in reducing our Scope 3 emissions (down 24% since 2022), controlling our scopes 1 and 2 emissions in spite of business growth and continuing to invest in the communities where we operate.

""We are transforming the future of technology innovation while we anchor purpose at the heart of our business strategy.”

Energy consumption inside the factory is also under the spotlight. Applied’s goal is to reduce energy use per wafer pass—essentially, how much power is needed to process each semiconductor—by 30% by 2030.

At present, it’s achieved a 13% improvement from 2019 levels. The company says it’s more than a third of the way to the goal across its full product range.

Energy and the ecosystem: suppliers, products and tools

Energy isn’t just about what Applied uses itself—it’s about how much its tools and its suppliers use too.

The company’s ECO Services product offering now helps customers measure and reduce electricity and utility consumption when using Applied’s machinery. These tools also help monitor CO₂ emissions from equipment, giving manufacturers clearer visibility into their energy footprint.

Supply chain emissions, especially those tied to energy use, are a focus under the company’s SuCCESS2030 programme.

While the supply chain represents about 10% of Applied’s carbon footprint, it plays a much bigger role in shaping energy efficiency across the sector. This is because Applied’s suppliers also support other semiconductor companies, multiplying the impact of any shift to cleaner energy.

The report details how Applied collected data from 183 suppliers in 2024, with 109 providing detailed Scope 1 and 2 emissions data. Nearly 100 suppliers said they now have greenhouse gas reduction targets, and 23 of those are aligned with science-based targets.

Applied is now holding direct conversations with its major suppliers about transitioning to renewables.

The report says: “Applied continues to collaborate with suppliers, using their provided survey data, to help them create emissions-reduction plans. We also engage a third party to help them calculate their emissions data.

""In 2024, we began one-on-one conversations with our major suppliers to discuss our net zero aspirations and review their ability to transition their facility and suppliers to renewable energy.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/57e908432bddf7d67ad677616ae08209:2eb5ec51ad4f485e461d96322667010c/appliedmaterials.png.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 12:25:02.165152

Consumers Energy’s $135-Mile Pipeline Modernization Aims to Strengthen Reliability Statewide

JACKSON, Mich. — July 7, 2025 — Consumers Energy has launched a sweeping upgrade to Michigan natural gas infrastructure, replacing 135 miles of aging cast iron and steel pipelines across 15 communities this summer. The effort involves over 600 workers and is part of the utility’s broader plan to enhance safety and reliability for 1.8 million residential and business customers.

The projects are underway in Southeast Michigan, Flint, Saginaw/Bay City, Kalamazoo, Lansing, Midland, and more. Several of the targeted pipelines are over 100 years old.

“These projects are a visible demonstration of Consumers Energy’s commitment to delivering natural gas safely, affordably and reliably,” said Holly Bowers, vice president of natural gas engineering and supply at Consumers Energy.

This infrastructure overhaul complements the ongoing Four Cities Metro Pipeline project, a multiyear initiative aimed at fortifying regional gas supply in the Detroit area.

Communities Across Michigan Will See Construction Through Summer 2025

The company outlined pipeline replacements across several Michigan cities:

Southeast Michigan: 18 miles in Livonia, 18 in Warren, 7 in Bloomfield, 6 in Pontiac, 2 in Royal Oak

Flint area: 10 miles in Flint, 6 in Owosso, 2 in Fowlerville

Saginaw/Bay City: 8 and 9 miles in Bay City, 5 in Saginaw, 3 in Frankenmuth

Lansing region: 14 miles in Holt

Mid-Michigan: 12 miles in Kalamazoo, 10 in St. Louis, 3 in Auburn, and 1 in Ithaca

Consumers Energy is encouraging motorists to watch for work crews along roadways. Most roads will remain open with some lane closures.

Old Pipelines Replaced as Consumers Energy Focuses on Long-Term Reliability

The upgrade is part of the utility’s Natural Gas Delivery Plan, a 10-year roadmap to ensure reliable service in all seasons and cut down risk from aging infrastructure. According to the company, the cost to customers remains below $3 per household per day.

“Modernizing our system now allows us to serve Michigan well into the future,” said Bowers. “We’re prioritizing areas where impact is greatest.”

Michigan’s natural gas network remains crucial to economic activity, heating homes, and powering businesses. The utility said these construction projects will also spur local jobs.

Natural Gas Safety and Economic Impact Remain Key Motivators

Consumers Energy says replacing old cast iron and steel lines not only increases safety, but also reduces the risk of gas leaks and interruptions. The upgrades are expected to help the utility meet federal safety and environmental standards, including methane reduction goals.

Experts note that aging natural gas infrastructure is a national concern. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), older metal pipelines are more susceptible to corrosion and leaks, leading to greater safety and environmental risks.

Four Cities Metro Pipeline Also Underway in Southeast Michigan

In addition to the 135-mile replacement effort, Consumers Energy continues work on its Four Cities Metro Pipeline, a significant gas transmission line serving the Detroit metro area. That project is expected to run through the remainder of the decade.

Consumers Energy is Michigan’s largest utility, delivering gas and/or electricity to 6.8 million of the state’s 10 million residents across all 68 Lower Peninsula counties.

These projects announced today were funded under the EIP’s Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage RD&D call for proposals. The call supports the research, development and demonstration of next-generation carbon capture and storage technologies that have the potential to significantly reduce the costs of capturing and storing carbon through three streams:

Capture: To drive down the cost and enhance performance of capture technologies for different emission sources.

Storage and Transportation: to characterize and develop safe, permanent subsurface CO2 storage and technologies that support safe and efficient transportation of CO2 and storage opportunities across Canada.

Utilization: RD&D of CO2 utilization technologies that reduce costs, energy use and carbon intensity while enabling large-scale, long-term CO2 sequestration.

As referenced in Budget 2024, the federal government delivered, on a priority basis, a suite of major economic investment tax credits, representing $93 billion in incentives by 2034–35, to create jobs and keep Canada on track to reduce pollution and reach net zero by 2050. This includes a Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Investment Tax Credit.

“The G3 is a NextGen offering for travelers who want to live, work, and roam in comfort, grounded in what matters,” says Sam Shapiro, CEO of Grounded.
It’s a ground-up reimagining of our smart, fully electric RV that’s based on real-world use.
Grounded says the G3 is its most-capable and comfort-focused electric camper van yet.
“For the G3, we’ve combined sustainable materials with modular architecture that’s built to last,” says Nick Fitzpatrick, head of design at Grounded.","Grounded, the electric RV startup founded by former SpaceX engineers and headquartered at Michigan Central (Newlab) in Detroit, has unveiled its most advanced camper van to date: the G3.

Built on the all-electric General Motors Co. BrightDrop platform, the G3 promised to deliver a 286-mile combined range on a single charge and introduces what the makers are calling industry-leading advancements in modular design, all-season comfort, and sustainability.

Grounded officials say the company is part of a growing wave of companies shaping the future of how people move and live. The G3 is said to reflect that mission by combining off-grid capability with smart, sustainable design for travelers who want freedom without compromising their values.

“The G3 is a NextGen offering for travelers who want to live, work, and roam in comfort, grounded in what matters,” says Sam Shapiro, CEO of Grounded. “The G3 builds on everything we learned from our customers and from the G2. It’s a ground-up reimagining of our smart, fully electric RV that’s based on real-world use.

“We replaced wood cabinetry with durable aluminum frames and 100 percent recycled tree-free materials, refined every wall panel and furniture module to deliver designer-grade aesthetics with pro-functionality, added a motorized lift bed that transforms into a California king, and designed a new insulated rear door that improves energy efficiency without sacrificing the view.”

Grounded also re-engineered the electrical system for 1,400W vehicle-to-house charging and added self-heating batteries to enable four-season travel. Every improvement from materials to layout was shaped by feedback from G2 owners, according to the company.

“The G3 is smarter, stronger, and more adaptable than any other offering on the market today,” Shapiro says.

Grounded says the G3 is its most-capable and comfort-focused electric camper van yet. Built on the Chevrolet BrightDrop Zevo 400 or 600 chassis, it’s engineered for year-round performance. With a single-charge range of 286 miles and all-wheel drive, it’s capable of both long-distance travel and rugged conditions. Its reinforced aluminum substructure supports a full suite of onboard systems, including rooftop HVAC, 1000W of solar, and Starlink internet, while maintaining structural integrity and maximizing space.

Up to 20kWh of modular, self-heating LiFePO batteries power the G3’s living systems, and can be recharged through rooftop solar, shore power, or a newly developed 1,400W vehicle-to-house charging system. With improved insulation and winterization, the G3 is built to operate in temperatures as low as 0°F without compromising comfort or power availability.

Inside, the G3 introduces a “refined, industrial-grade approach” to materials: cabinetry is framed with aluminum and finished with 100 percent recycled materials in customizable colors and textures. The new cabinet system is more durable and low maintenance than traditional RV interiors. These materials resist warping, scratching, and wear over time, the automaker says.

The redesigned rear of the van replaces the roll-up garage door with a full-width swing-out entry, improving thermal efficiency and adding functional mount points for storage and gear – in addition to increasing interior standing height. Large windows throughout, including one in the rear door, provide natural light and panoramic views.

All systems onboard are managed through Grounded’s integrated Grounded+ App, which gives users remote access to power usage, tank levels, appliance controls, and system diagnostics via LTE or Bluetooth. The app’s layout auto-adjusts to match the configuration of each customer’s build.

As with all Grounded vehicles, the G3 is backed by BrightDrop’s 8-year/100,000-mile platform warranty and includes a one-year interior warranty. It’s compatible with CCS fast chargers nationwide and comes with a CCS-to-NACS adapter for access to Tesla Superchargers. Combined with access to a growing BrightDrop service network, the G3 offers long-haul freedom with the reliability and support of a nationwide EV ecosystem.

“For our customers, the van is a culmination of their dream lifestyle and values,” says Nadia Meyer, chief product officer at Grounded. “It’s an act of quiet rebellion to break out of the mundane and redesign their lifestyle to be filled with nature and beauty. The aesthetics and function of every detail are critical for such a compact space. Grounded’s design philosophy is form follows function.”

The Configurator Tool, available at configurator.groundedrvs.com, allows customers to build out every aspect of their G3 from floor plan tier to cabinetry color, bed fabric, and countertop texture, while watching their custom camper come to life in real-time 3-D. An orbital camera lets users view the vehicle from any angle, inside and out, while each step in the process reflects their personal preferences and priorities. After submitting a build, Grounded’s team follows up directly to finalize details and assist with next steps.

One of the most flexible features of the G3 is its multi-position bed platform, which can be raised or lowered at the touch of a button. In its lower position, it supports a sleeping arrangement that can expand to California king size. When not in use, the bed lifts out of the way, opening up a comfortable lounge or workspace below.

A new outdoor patio functionality with a pull-out drawer that has an integrated counter for cooking and dining, as well as compartments to store cooking equipment and outdoor chairs.

Rear seating for driving with additional passengers in the rear also is currently in development, and expected to be available for the G3 in the fall of 2025.

“For the G3, we’ve combined sustainable materials with modular architecture that’s built to last,” says Nick Fitzpatrick, head of design at Grounded.

Using Grounded’s Configurator Tool, G3’s can be customized across three tiers:

G3 Form ($165,000): A sleek, minimalist build with a queen bed and essential furnishings.

G3 Function ($180,000): Adds expanded kitchen, lounge, and power for extended trips

G3 Freedom ($200,000): Fully loaded with max battery, Starlink, lift bed, bathroom, and bespoke finishes.

Available on the Zevo 400 or Zevo 600 platform (now under Chevrolet), the G3 includes all-wheel drive, 11,000-pound GVWR, and safety features like Enhanced Automatic Emergency Braking, Forward Collision Alert, and more.

Grounded recently has expanded its builds to support commercial applications across mobile health, food and beverage, pet, trades, and office verticals.",https://cdn.dbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/07/Grounded800.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:24:40.256064

In a statement published on Jul. 4, Clean Energy Canada gave three recommendations to the federal government to help deliver affordable EVs to Canadians for less than $40,000.

The group, based out of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said Ottawa should retool its EV mandate by revisiting its near-term targets to help the auto sector “weather this temporary storm” of slumping EV sales.

“Any additional flexibility added in the regulation should be designed to achieve other EV-related goals, such as delivering more affordable EVs and building out Canada’s charging network,” says the statement by executive director Rachel Doran and director of public affairs Joanna Kyriazis.

The plea comes on the heels of auto manufacturing leaders meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney last week, in which the CEOs repeated their calls for the mandate to be repealed.

Starting next year, the mandate would require 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada to be zero-emission vehicles. Those also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The target rises annually to 100 per cent by 2035.

Recent data from Statistics Canada suggests EVs accounted for 7.53 per cent of all new vehicles sold in April.

Following the meeting, the head of an organization representing Ford Canada, GM Canada and Stellantis said he was “cautiously optimistic” the government would take action on the mandate.

Clean Energy Canada also called on Ottawa to re-fund the EV incentive program, but to be clearer as to when the program will be phased out.

The government launched the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program in 2019, which gave car buyers up to $5,000 toward the cost of an electric vehicle. The program was abruptly suspended back in January when its funding ran out.

It has left many dealerships on the hook for the rebate if they hadn’t already sent in their claim before the program ended. The federal government put nearly $3 billion into the program during its lifespan.

“The rebate should start at $5,000 and decline by $1,000 each year, providing consumers and automakers with a well-communicated phaseout that avoids periods of artificially lowered EV sales as buyers await the return of rebates or at least clarity,” Clean Energy Canada says.

A similar policy is in place in Quebec.

Federal ministers have said in recent months that the government was working toward bringing back consumer incentives on EVs.

Those promises faced criticism from automakers themselves because, without implementing a rebate, EV sales are slumping further, as buyers wait for the rebates to come back.

Clean Energy Canada also called on the federal government to reconsider its approach to cheaper EVs from China, which are subject to a 100 per cent tariff which took effect in October. Ottawa is scheduled to review the measure later this year.

“Allowing in a limited quota of these affordable vehicles while also recognizing EU-approved vehicles … would open Canada’s vehicle market to fill important market gaps, drive innovation and ultimately make our auto sector more competitive,” the group says.",https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/favicon.png,N,,2025-07-07 12:25:07.780774

United Energy LNG and Power LNG announced today the signing of a strategic merger that will create a scalable small-scale LNG platform serving industrial, power, and transport markets across North America.

The combined entity, operating under United Energy LNG (UE LNG), immediately oversees a portfolio of three LNG production sites in advanced stages of development. UE LNG is announcing the commencement of Front-End Loading Phase 1 (FEL-1) at its first project site in Houston, Texas, with a second confidential site underway. A third site in Independence, Kansas is scheduled to begin FEL-1 later this month. With geographic diversity and early-stage capacity, UE LNG aims to expand LNG access for high-demand domestic users.

“While the majors are focused on megaprojects, we’re deploying modular, nimble solutions that get LNG to the people and industries who need it now,” said Brian Guinn, Chief Executive Officer of United Energy LNG.

Modular LNG for Distributed Markets

Unlike traditional LNG developments requiring multi-billion-dollar investments and long permitting timelines, United Energy LNG is focused on scalable, regionally targeted solutions:

Small-scale liquefaction units designed for local and regional demand

Modular deployment to reduce lead times and capital intensity

Focused on inland, onshore, and distributed energy applications

Virtual pipeline logistics to bypass pipeline constraints

This approach enables faster project execution and cost-effective access to clean fuels for underserved markets.

Addressing Gaps in the U.S. LNG Infrastructure Landscape

Despite global LNG investment nearing $200 billion annually, small-scale LNG remains the least crowded, most overlooked frontier in U.S. energy. Major players focus on export, while decentralized markets remain stranded. That gap is UE LNG’s advantage.

“This merger represents the alignment of speed, innovation, and execution,” said Austin Terry, CEO of Power LNG. “By combining our development and operational expertise with United Energy’s capital platform, we’re unlocking a scalable model for delivering LNG where it’s needed most.”

Inside the Transaction

The merger combines United Energy’s upstream operating experience and public market presence with Power LNG’s permitting progress, engineering capabilities, and pipeline of modular projects. Key metrics include:

3 Active Development Sites across Texas, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast

Targeted Liquefaction Capacity of up to 540,000 MTPA at full deployment

Estimated Capital Investment: $240–270 million across three facilities

Cash flow projections targeting breakeven within 12–18 months post-commissioning

Engineering, procurement, and strategic project management partnerships

Public market access via United Energy LNG’s parent company (OTCMKTS: UNRG)

Distributed LNG for Energy Transition Applications

UE LNG’s modular platform is being developed to serve:

Remote and underserved power generation sites

Heavy-duty transportation and marine fueling networks

Critical infrastructure requiring fuel resilience

Industrial operations seeking lower-emission alternatives to diesel and propane

Outlook and Commercial Pathway

United Energy LNG plans to reach financial close on its first three facilities by Q1 2026, with commissioning expected by Q1 2027. The company is actively engaging with feedgas suppliers, utilities, and logistics providers to build out a nationwide virtual LNG delivery network.

The company estimates that its addressable domestic market exceeds 2 billion cubic feet equivalent annually, representing a $3+ billion opportunity in underserved power, transport, and industrial sectors.

“This is just the beginning,” said Guinn. “By 2028, we aim to operate a network of scalable LNG hubs serving a portfolio of contracted customers across the U.S., turning America’s natural gas into clean, distributed power for everyone.”

And we’re going to do that again, except this time much more comprehensively. We did tax cuts and regulatory reform, and that brought about a resurgence of the U.S. economy. That’s about — that’s what’s going to happen here. It’s about to happen on steroids. And we can’t wait for that to happen. This is jet fuel for the economy, and all boats are going to rise.

AMY GOODMAN: So, that was House Speaker Johnson’s response to reporter Antonia Juhasz, who’s doing — just published a piece for Rolling Stone magazine. One of the groups who will see their funding cut is Inclusive Louisiana. Antonia reports the group received a half-a-million-dollar grant with local partner groups, Louisiana Bucket Brigade and Rural Roots. The grant was awarded through an Inflation Reduction Act environmental and climate justice block grant program that provides financial assistance to groups working to address local environmental or public health issues in their communities, the grant terminated in May by the Trump administration. This is an ad they had made for their campaign, Imagine St. James Parish.

BARBARA WASHINGTON: For too long, petrochemical plants have been poisoning our people, and with the approval of the St. James Parish government.

MYRTLE FELTON: Building more facilities that spew toxic chemicals into historically Black communities.

BARBARA WASHINGTON: But now we are reclaiming our future. Together, we can imagine a pollution-free St. James Parish, and we can build an inclusive economy. What can you imagine?

MYRTLE FELTON: Tell us at ImagineStJamesParish.org. Paid for by Inclusive Louisiana.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we are joined by Antonia Juhasz in Washington, D.C., where she followed the budget bill negotiations, award-winning, longtime investigative journalist covering oil and energy and regular contributor to Rolling Stone magazine, her latest piece, “They’re Fighting Polluters. Trump’s Tax Bill Guts Their Funding: Across Louisiana, communities are bracing for the tax bill’s massive cuts to critical funding for local community organizing and resilience.” Among her books is The Tyranny of Oil.

Antonia, welcome back to Democracy Now! We just have a few minutes before we talk about what’s happening in Gaza, and we wanted to ask you — you got in that last question to the House speaker. Explain what you were asking about and his response?

ANTONIA JUHASZ: Yeah, so, I had been traveling across rural Louisiana to investigate the impacts of the tax bill on environmental and climate justice, and environment more broadly. And I had asked the speaker: What would he say to those communities that are going to be cut off now as a result of the tax bill? And you heard his lengthy response.

The facts are that this bill zeroes out, to the best extent that it could do, the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s signature climate bill. It includes the zeroing out of environmental and climate justice grants that — some 800 of them, and programs that went to help local frontline communities confront polluters in their area. This bill has been called the worst environmental bill in U.S. history.

You started with the Texas floods. We know that the climate crisis kills. We also know that we have remedies: cut fossil fuels, transition to localized renewable energy and support frontline communities. Those programs have essentially been erased, to the best extent that they could, in this tax bill to remove tax incentives that would help us support solar and wind energy manufacturing. Tax breaks for consumers, producers, those were entirely stripped away to cut out that financial support for the solar and wind transition. Tax breaks, billions of them, to the fossil fuel industry. And remember, this bill extends all of those tax cuts from 2017, which had already brought billions of dollars to the fossil fuel industry, and just gives them new benefits. One of the perks that Lisa Murkowski got for voting for the bill was opening up the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. There’s other provisions that reduce the tax — the royalties that the U.S. would get from drilling in public lands, so a big giveaway and an opening the door to more production. It provides more tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry. It eliminates rules, for example, that were trying to address methane emissions.

It’s a Christmas tree for the fossil fuel industry. It’s a frontal assault on environmental and climate justice. And it will set us back significantly, unless we take action to confront the climate crisis. It was one big, additional boondoggle for the fossil fuel industry and to harm local environmental and climate justice organizing and our national and international attempts to confront the climate crisis.

AMY GOODMAN: Antonia, the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, put 139 workers on leave after they publicly criticized Trump’s environmental policies and signed a declaration of dissent last week, many of them high-level people in the EPA, were given like 10 minutes to leave their offices. Talk about what this declaration of dissent was.

ANTONIA JUHASZ: So, I interviewed — I’ve been interviewing for months Environmental Protection Agency staff. So, the Trump administration has been working, through the DOGE process, the EPA to gut environmental, climate, environmental justice rules. It’s been losing in court, left and right, in those efforts. They have been found to be illegal. So, therefore, the administration is trying to use — or, did use, excuse me, the tax bill, to achieve through that bill what it was losing through the courts.

EPA employees working on environmental justice, working on climate, working on protecting our air, our water, protecting us from pollution, have been trying to speak out. They’ve been put on administrative leave. Many also accepted their early buyouts, because they didn’t want to have to deal with this administration. Others have been increasingly speaking out. And this letter that came out was the largest organizing of those EPA employees to state their opposition to what was happening. And the Trump administration then put 144 of them on administrative leave.

AMY GOODMAN: And we will link to that letter, that declaration of dissent, at democracynow.org. Antonia Juhasz, thanks so much for being with us, longtime investigative journalist. We’ll link to her Rolling Stone piece, “They’re Fighting Polluters. Trump’s Tax Bill Guts Their Funding.”

Next up, we’ll talk about Gaza. Could there be a truce? As the Israeli prime minister meets with President Trump in D.C. today, we’ll speak with Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, who’s volunteered in Gaza and writes, “Hospital Attacks in Gaza and Israel: What Counts as a War Crime?” Stay with us.

Read More Why Homeowners Are Rushing to Install Solar Panels Is the EV Tax Credit Going Away Under Trump?","If you purchased an electric vehicle, that doesn’t mean you get to bypass road taxes.

Dozens of states have implemented taxes and registration fees targeting EV owners. That way, commuters can contribute what some lawmakers see as their “fair share” of highway funding, which is often collected via gas (motor fuel) taxes.

The latest addition to that list is Hawaii, which just launched its new state road usage charge program on July 1 for light-duty passenger electric vehicles.

Eligible EV owners in the Aloha State can opt to pay a state per-mile road usage charge of $8 per 1,000 miles, which is capped at $50 per year, or pay a flat annual state road user charge (RUC) of $50.

Both of these options replace the state’s current $50 EV registration surcharge, according to Hawaii’s Department of Transportation. By 2028, the state-per-mile RUC will become mandatory for EVs, and by 2033, it should include all light-duty vehicles.

“Instead of paying based on what type of car you drive — or can afford — a road usage charge means vehicle owners will pay only for how much they actually drive,” said Ed Sniffen, Hawaii’s Department of Transportation (DOT) Director.

While opting for an electric vehicle may come with higher annual fees or taxes, getting a federal EV tax credit worth up to $7,500 was a popular incentive.

Here’s the problem: The federal tax credit for clean vehicles is likely going away under President Donald Trump’s so-called “big beautiful bill” which Republicans aim to pass by the Fourth of July.

Read on to see if switching to an electric vehicle will still be a worthwhile investment for you.

Road taxes for EV drivers

As you may have guessed, road infrastructure and maintenance are paid for by federal, state, and local government revenue.

The funding to keep roads safe is gathered through a combination of taxes on motor fuel, fees on vehicles like registration and licensure, and tolls.

As more people switch to EVs, some states have implemented added fees to make up for lost gas tax revenue. These include:

Higher registration fees compared to gasoline-powered vehicles

Imposing pay-per-mile programs or an annual road usage fee so EV and hybrid drivers can contribute to road infrastructure

Taxing electric vehicle drivers at higher rates

How high can EV registration fees go? In Colorado, you can expect to pay $50 if you’re registering an electric vehicle. However, in New Jersey, you’ll pay a registration fee as high as $290 starting in 2028. These fees vary depending on where you live.

Does your state have EV registration fees?

There are currently 39 states that require additional registration fees from electric vehicle drivers. If you’re in the market for an EV, some of these fees can make you think twice.

High upfront charges: In Texas, you’ll have to pay $400 for the registration of a new EV on top of standard registration fees. This initial payment covers the first two years of registration. For each subsequent year, you’ll have to pay a $200 annual fee. These fees are directed to the state’s highway funding.

Inflation adjustments: Folks in Pennsylvania who want to purchase an electric vehicle will also be hit by a $200 annual EV registration fee, which will increase to $250 in 2026. The registration fee will be indexed to inflation for subsequent years. Likewise, annual plug-in hybrid registration models will cost you $50 in 2025 and $62.50 next year, which is also adjusted for inflation.

Pay upon weight: In Oklahoma, the amount you pay on annual registration fees is based on the weight of your EV or hybrid vehicle. An EV vehicle under 6,000 lbs. will set you back $110, while a vehicle over 26,000 lbs. can cost you $2,250.

Trump’s bill kills EV tax credit

To encourage commuters to purchase electric vehicles and promote clean energy, the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) included a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for qualifying “clean vehicles.

The EV tax credit, which is also eligible for some used electric cars, was supposed to be in place until December 2032. However, it's now on the GOP chopping block under Trump’s newly enacted legislative tax package known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

As reported by Kiplinger, the megabill will eliminate the EV tax credit for new, used, and leased vehicles. What does that look like?

Republican lawmakers will eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for the purchase or lease of a new EV.

The $4,000 tax break for the purchase of a used EV will also end.

The EV tax credit will sunset after September 2025.

That means if you’d like to purchase an EV and still get a tax break, this year (the coming months) will be your last chance to snag that tax incentive before it's gone.

Stay tuned to Kiplinger’s coverage on Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" as some of the measures in it will impact everyday choices from major purchases that promote clean energy, like your vehicle or solar panels, to crucial tax breaks for families and your access to healthcare.

Driving the Week

A WIN FOR TRUMP, AND DUFFY: After months of negotiations, Republicans on Capitol Hill have pushed through President Donald Trump’s domestic policy package, leaving the Senate’s high-profile transportation provisions unchanged, Sam reports. Those include about $12.5 billion for air traffic control upgrades, which DOT Secretary Sean Duffy has been pushing for as he aims to revamp the national airspace.

— The big question: What’s next? As MT readers will know, Duffy has said this money isn’t enough to get the job done, raising questions about where the remaining funds will come from. Duffy’s timeline of three to four years to complete the project is ambitious, and he must move quickly if he has any chance of meeting his goal.

— In an X post, Duffy said he won’t rest “until this mission is complete.” A DOT spokesperson didn’t answer questions from your MT host about what Duffy will prioritize when it comes to the $12.5 billion. Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas), chair of the House Transportation Committee’s aviation panel, told Chris he thinks Duffy wants an additional $8 billion. “Let’s see how we spend” the existing dollars, Nehls said.

TICK TOCK: The FAA is seeking proposals from companies no later July 25 on the air traffic control effort.

SO MUCH MORE: The megabill, which Trump signed into law Friday, included other provisions touching on everything from new fees on commercial space launches and reentries — a major change for the booming industry — to the termination of electric vehicle tax credits on Sept. 30, which puts a massive dent into the Biden-era push toward zero-emissions cars. There’s even language that will permanently erase pre-tax commuter benefits for those who bike to work, Pavan notes.

WHAT DIDN’T MAKE IT IN: A proposal from House Transportation Chair Sam Graves (R-Mo.) to impose new registration fees on EVs and hybrids, which would have been remitted to the flagging Highway Trust Fund, wasn’t in the final text. (The Senate nixed this language.) But expect the idea to stage a comeback as lawmakers begin to draft the next surface transportation bill in earnest.

POLITICAL FALLOUT: Elon Musk, Trump’s former bureaucracy-slashing adviser and the world’s richest man, has clashed with his one-time buddy over the megabill, and said Saturday he was launching a new political party. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,” he wrote on X, his social media platform. He added in a later post: “The way we’re going to crack the uniparty system is by using a variant of how Epaminondas shattered the myth of Spartan invincibility at Leuctra: Extremely concentrated force at a precise location on the battlefield.” He vowed to roll out his strategy during the 2026 midterms.

Infrastructure

FIRST IN MT: DOT is updating a credit assistance program that provides long-term, low-interest loans to infrastructure projects of regional or national significance in a bid to speed up the completion of construction and curtail recipients’ need for federal grants. Historically, only limited kinds of projects could finance up to 49 percent of eligible costs under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or TIFIA, program, with most loans being capped at up to 33 percent. DOT is now expanding the option to finance up to 49 percent, offering it to “all types” of infrastructure projects in the sector.

— “Unleashing the full value of the TIFIA program represents another step forward in getting America building again,” Duffy said in a statement.

Trade

KEEP AN EYE ON IT: Freight movement between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico dipped in April, DOT data shows — and experts say Trump’s tariffs may be to blame, Pavan reports. (It was the largest month-over-month drop since the height of the Covid pandemic.) The decrease came as Trump’s car duties kicked into gear.

— Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) said the auto industry is trying to adjust to the new trade policy, and “that may very well be reflected in those numbers.” Check out this chart to see what happened:

APPROPRIATIONS

NOT YET: Just a reminder: the House Appropriations Committee’s transportation panel won’t hold a markup Monday of its fiscal 2026 budget bill. The event was initially set for today, but has been pushed back to July 14 at 6 p.m.

Aviation

MAKING PROGRESS: The FAA, as anticipated, transitioned early Thursday to a new fiber optic communications network between facilities in New York and Philadelphia — a key upgrade following a series of technology disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport earlier this year. (The line was laid in June and got tested over the past month.)

ICYMI: The NTSB has issued a preliminary report about how four T-38 Air Force jets bound for a flyover of Arlington National Cemetery in March narrowly avoided a Delta Air Lines plane taking off from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport — one of several concerning incidents in the local airspace this year.

Transit

BIG RAMIFICATIONS? The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear two cases involving NJ Transit, which is being sued in Pennsylvania and New York after its buses allegedly hit people outside the Garden State, Ry Rivard reports.

— The routine personal injury claims caught the high court’s attention because in 2019, justices ruled 5-4 that one state can’t be sued in another state’s courts without the first state’s consent. But the decision left one key issue unclear: what state entities get such immunity, such as transit providers.

Labor

SOME IMPROVEMENT: The unemployment rate for U.S. transportation was 4.5 percent (not seasonally adjusted) in June, new Bureau of Labor Statistics data show. That’s a decrease compared to the rate in the same month last year, but above the pre-pandemic level of 4.1 percent in June 2019.

We’ll take a look at the week ahead and look back on what you may have missed last week.

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS PUSH BACK ON GAS PLANTS: Environmentalists slammed conclusions by the state’s independent grid operator that new or repowered fossil fuel units may be needed for reliability. The New York Independent System Operator indicated in its most recent “Power Trends” report — a summary of previous analysis with additional context designed to keep policymakers and the public informed about the electric grid — that repowering gas plants should be considered given growing demand and a slow buildout of renewables.

But environmental groups — Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Evergreen Action and WE ACT for Environmental Justice — want Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration to reject calls for more gas power. “It seems that NYISO is irresponsibly seeking to create a false narrative that New York needs new gas generation, even though there is no evidence to support that claim,” says a letter sent from the groups to Hochul and state officials. The NYISO’s most recent reliability analysis that the “Power Trends” report is based on did not find a statewide reliability issue, based on new large loads being flexible enough to turn off when needed. It did identify reliability problems in New York City if NYPA retires its natural gas peakers. But the grid operator has repeatedly been raising concerns about the narrowing margins for reliability and the aging fossil fuel fleet.

The letter also criticizes the lengthy interconnection timelines for renewables, saying that resources take 6 to 7 years to connect. That aligns with findings from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, but may not take into account delays caused by developers changing project design, choosing to wait for state contracts or permits, or other factors out of the NYISO’s control. NYISO spokesperson Kevin Lanahan said the grid operator has made significant improvements in recent years to reduce interconnection timelines. The targeted timeline for the current process is 1.6 years. “We continue to meet with all stakeholders, including Earthjustice and EDF, through our open governance process to identify further improvements to interconnection while also maintaining reliability of the electric grid,” he said.

“'Power Trends’ suggests that the repowering of all aging resource types — renewable and fossil — be examined to determine the opportunity for capacity additions, efficiency, and carbon reductions,” Lanahan said. “Doing so may help bridge New York to its climate goals.”

Although the letter calls on Hochul to reject gas power plants, her administration has also warmed to the idea that gas will continue to be needed to meet demand from large new factories upstate and electrification of vehicles and buildings. Hochul officials referred to the NYISO’s findings as part of the state’s energy planning process, which modeled a pathway that involves continued reliance on fossil fuel energy and repowering of aging fossil fuel power plants. One scenario includes potentially relying on gas beyond the state’s statutory 2040 deadline for zero emission electricity. “The plan is talking about wind, solar, energy storage and also repowering aging combustion power plants as a way to move from here to there, as well as the contribution … of emissions free resources that are dispatchable like advanced nuclear,” said NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen Harris last month. The governor announced plans for NYPA to build at least 1 gigawatt of new nuclear power. — Marie J. French

ICYMI: NJ TRANSIT CASES GO TO SCOTUS — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: A pair of bus accidents is prompting the Supreme Court to reckon with the scope of state entities’ immunity from lawsuits.

The court on Thursday agreed to hear two cases involving NJ Transit, which is being sued in Pennsylvania and New York state court after its buses allegedly hit people outside the borders of its home base Garden State.

The high court sees a novel legal issue in the otherwise routine personal injury claims — which is partly of its own making. In 2019, it ruled 5-4 that one state cannot be sued in another state’s courts without the first state’s consent.

The ruling left unclear where to draw the line on which state entities get such immunity, leaving open a question about entities like state hospitals, student loan servicers and public transit providers. Attorneys in the personal injury cases argued NJ Transit isn’t actually entitled to a state’s immunity, even though the transit agency was created by the state. NJ Transit said lawsuits should be brought against it in New Jersey state court because that’s where it is based.

What you may have missed

PIPELINE TEST — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: Gov. Kathy Hochul faces a major decision on a new pipeline supported by President Donald Trump to bring more natural gas into the New York City region.

The Department of Environmental Conservation declared the application for a water quality permit for the Northeast Supply Enhancement Project complete on Wednesday. The pipeline would run 24 miles from New Jersey, across the Raritan Bay, to connect to the pipeline system in the Rockaways.

The state told federal agencies last month it would make a decision on the project by Nov. 30, in compliance with an accelerated timeline under a Trump executive order. The DEC declined to schedule any public hearings at this stage, a move sure to spark pushback from environmental advocates.

— National Grid filed an updated long-term gas plan Wednesday, highlighting reliability and cost savings for customers if NESE is built.

“National Grid is committed to fulfilling our responsibility to provide safe, reliable, and affordable energy to our customers,” said Sally Librera, president of National Grid New York. “This addendum to our Gas System Long-Term Plan outlines critical investments necessary to ensure our gas network continues to operate dependably and supports the region’s growing energy needs.”

— NEW JERSEY LEG: The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said it has received land use and air permit applications from Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Co. for the portion of its proposed Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline in the Garden State. A DEP spokesperson said most of the permits have a 120-day total permit review window but a Freshwater Wetlands permit does not have a statutory deadline.

Several New Jersey towns have passed resolutions opposing the project, according to the Sierra Club, which also opposes it. — Ry Rivard

PORTAL NORTH — Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) toured the Portal North Bridge project on Wednesday morning along with top officials from NJ Transit and Amtrak. The bridge, which is part of the larger Gateway program and sits between Jersey City and Newark, will replace an old bridge over the Hackensack River that creates a chokepoint for trains moving around New Jersey and in and out of New York City.

After a bruising fight over the megabill this week that Booker strongly opposes, he sounded a bipartisan note about the bridge. President Donald Trump green-lit the bridge during his first administration after lobbying from Gov. Phil Murphy and it’s since gotten billions of dollars in federal money.

“I didn’t stop and ask one hardhat whether they voted for me or not, whether they voted for which party or not,” Booker said following a tour of the construction site. “This is about Americans working together to get great things done, to build projects that serve all of America.”

The bridge is expected to be finished in fall 2027 with one track in service in 2026. — Ry Rivard

DEP MULLS COASTAL RULES CHANGE — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: The Murphy administration is reconsidering parts of the sprawling package of coastal building rules meant to cope with rising sea levels.

It’s unclear what amendments the Department of Environmental Protection might make, but Commissioner Shawn LaTourette has publicly shown he’s open to changes. At a recent public event, he said he was “not allergic” to amendments. Lobbyists on both sides of the issue are now expecting a new draft of the rules.

One of the biggest flashpoints is the assumed amount of sea level rise that developers should prepare for. The original draft rule assumes, using scientists’ projections, that sea levels will rise by 5 feet by the end of the century — a major threat to development and tourism along the state’s 130 miles or so of coastline.

That concerns environmental groups supporting the rule, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club and the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters. Advocates from both groups are worried that revising the rule could delay its final adoption. Gov. Phil Murphy is term-limited and leaves office in January. “We are concerned because the clock is ticking,” said Anjuli Ramos-Busot, the state Sierra Club director.

Ray Cantor, a representative of the Business and Industry Association, has helped organize opposition to the rule package, including a plane that flew over the Jersey Shore last summer carrying a sign that warned about the rule. He’s also waiting to see what the DEP does. “Until we know what they are going to do, our concerns remain,” he said.

PORTAL NORTH SETTLEMENT — NJ Transit paid $450,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by a former engineer who alleged he was fired for raising concerns about the design of the Portal North bridge, the most expensive project in the transit agency’s history. Mohammed Nasin, who was the chief of construction management for the rail bridge, alleged in an early 2024 lawsuit that he’d found design defects, including track settlement issues.

The settlement happened earlier this year, on Jan. 22, but was below the threshold that requires NJ Transit board approval. It was, however, disclosed to lawmakers in May after Sen. Michael Testa, a Cumberland County Republican, asked about the litigation during back and forths over the budget. In a written response to Testa, NJ Transit revealed the settlement. The agency said Portal North is “on time and on budget, with Amtrak scheduled to take over construction of track, catenary and other systems in the coming months. The bridge project is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2027. The Portal Bridge project has an excellent safety record.”

John Chartier, an NJ Transit spokesperson, said in an email to POLITICO that the $450,000 included back pay and attorneys’ fees. “There was no admission of liability by NJ Transit and there was a confidentiality clause in the settlement,” he said.

RATE HIKE PROPOSED — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: Two major upstate gas and electric utilities owned by Avangrid want to raise customer bills more than 20 percent.

New York State Electric and Gas and Rochester Gas and Electric filed their rate proposals on Monday, arguing they need to recover costs for storm recovery, unpaid bills and compliance with new in-state call center requirements.

NYSEG serves nearly 1 million electricity customers and 270,000 gas customers. RG&E serves 386,000 electricity customers and 320,000 natural gas customers. The two companies are owned by Avangrid, whose parent company is Spanish energy giant Iberdrola.

Utility rate hikes have become a political flashpoint as affordability remains top of mind for policymakers in New York. Gov. Kathy Hochul criticized the rate increase proposals.

The two utilities “must find a way to avoid these unacceptably high rate hikes,” she said in a statement. “I am calling on the Department of Public Service to scrutinize these proposals to ensure these companies have the resources to keep our energy grid going but are not making additional profit off the backs of ratepayers.”

BUDGET BASH — A pair of New Jersey Senate Democrats offered modest criticism of the state budget’s diversion of $190 million from the Board of Public Utilities’ clean energy fund to prop up NJ Transit and the state budget surplus.

Sen. Andrew Zwicker gave a brief floor speech about the diversion before his chamber approved the $58.8 billion budget deal on Monday afternoon, which Gov. Phil Murphy signed late Monday night. Zwicker said he understood the move but that the state needs to use the clean energy money to help get clean air, clean water and better energy prices.

“It is critically important that we make those investments moving forward,” Zwicker said.

In an interview, Sen. Bob Smith, who chairs the Senate’s energy committee, said there is a “tenuous connection” between clean energy funding and NJ Transit, since getting cars off the road is good for the environment.

But that connection, Smith said, is “not as strong as building new energy storage or building windmills or making our grid more flexible.”

The senators were not alone or loudest to lament term-limited Murphy’s final budget. Environmental groups also criticized the clean energy fund transfers, and both the attorney general and state comptroller, two members of Murphy’s own Cabinet, slammed other non-environmental aspects of the budget.

At a BPU meeting on Monday afternoon, none of the four members ventured to justify the money being taken from their budget, but they also did not criticize it.

“This budget is reflecting an additional diversion from the clean energy fund, but it is not reflecting a cutting of programs,” board President Christine Guhl-Sadovy said in the entity’s sole remark about the budget deal. — Ry Rivard

A BRIGHT SPOT — Both chambers have passed a bill to ease permitting of solar projects (S4100/A5264). “We should put people over paperwork so we can get more solar on our rooftops and more savings for ratepayers in our wallets — that’s a win for our environment, our electric grid and for all of us,” Sen. John McKeon, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Smith also said that both houses have passed legislation to provide $60 million to help with battery storage projects. That bill comes after a recently-approved BPU battery storage program that is funded with $125 million in money from the settlement with Orsted, the energy company that canceled a pair of offshore wind farms in the state. — Ry Rivard",https://static.politico.com/3d/ee/f4d549cf4e548af6712990ce5b9e/politico-cms-shared-graphic-1120x629.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:24:20.172750

Step one, is this a locally or regionally applicable action, or is this a nationally applicable action?","Andy Kriha: Hi, and welcome to our latest episode of ""An Energized Exchange."" I'm Andy Kriha, an associate at Holland & Knight in our Washington, D.C., office. I'm joined today by Susan Lafferty, a partner in our D.C. office, and Zach Pilchen, senior counsel in our D.C. office. And today, we are going to be talking about two recently decided Supreme Court cases, EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining and Oklahoma v. EPA, that were decided together, that overlap and really help us understand where EPA actions are going to be allowed to be challenged in the future. So with that, Zach, I want to throw it over to you to get us started with the text and history of the venue provision of the Clean Air Act.

Zach Pilchen: Thanks, Andy. So the Clean Air Act has a unique venue provision, Section 307(b) of the Clean Air Act. This is a pretty dense piece of text. Actually at oral argument, Justice Jackson called it very complicated, and Justice Kavanaugh said it was difficult to apply in a coherent way, but the Supreme Court found their way through it in the end.

So the text of the statute sets up these basically three options for venue when someone is challenging an EPA action under the Clean Air Act. So for things like the National Ambient Air Quality Standards or National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants or a list of other things in the Clean Act or for any, quote, ""other nationally applicable regulation or final action taken,"" you go to the D.C. Circuit. Second, by contrast, for any local or regionally applicable action — and the act gives examples of State Implementation Plans under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards program, as an example — you go to the appropriate regional circuit court of appeals. And then there's an exception though. So this was an exception that was put in in 1977, some major amendments of Clean Air Act that added a new option for basically allowing EPA to channel certain local or regionally applicable actions to the D.C. Circuit. And it says, for local originally applicable actions, if such action is based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect, and if EPA, when the agency takes that action, finds that that is in fact applicable, then you have to go to the D.C. Circuit. So it's basically a way for EPA, so long as an action is based on a determination of scope or effect, to channel something that would normally be heard in a regional circuit to the D.C. Circuit. And there's a lot of different reasons why EPA might want to do that, particularly in the context of an air pollution statute, given that, as the Supreme Court has recognized in other cases, air does not obey state boundaries very well. Why you would want to get kind of a uniform nationwide decision on some matters and not have that patch work, and so this third provision gives this opportunity for the EPA to channel things into the D.C. Circuit.

So with that context in mind, this Supreme Court case — it was actually a pair of Supreme Court cases — had some interesting procedural background. And I'm going to throw it to Susan to explain what was that issue in the Renewable Fuels Standard case Calumet.

Susan Lafferty: Great, thanks, Zach. Yeah, we'll go all the way back to November 2023 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled against EPA regarding its April and June 2022 small refinery exemption denials for six small refineries in Calumet Shreveport Refining v. EPA. We will also refer to small refinery exemptions by the acronym SREs. Six refineries challenged EPA's denials that applied to compliance years from 2016 to 2021, and the court ruled mostly for the small refineries. First, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the challenged SRE denials were locally or regionally applicable, what Zach was just discussing. Therefore, the court concluded that correct venue was actually in the Fifth Circuit rather than being transferred to the D.C. Circuit where EPA was arguing that jurisdiction should lay. The court said it took EPA at its word when the agency said it considered each of the small refinery petitions on the merits and looked at individual refinery information in issuing the denials. And therefore, EPA's denials relied on refinery-specific determinations rather than determinations of nationwide scope or effect.

Second, after the venue question, the Fifth Circuit went to the merits, and the court examined the EPA SRE policy that had been articulated in late 2021 and then in April and June of 2022 when EPA issued the blanket SRE denials on a new statutory interpretation that number one, a small refinery's quote-unquote, ""Disproportionate economic hardship must solely be caused by RFS compliance"" — in other words, the RINs that are purchased for compliance purposes. And then second, that the price of RINs necessary to purchase for compliance purposes is not borne by a refiner, or ultimately borne by the refiner, but instead is passed through to each subsequent purchaser of the fuel until the fuel is actually dispensed at the pump. Therefore, EPA concluded that no small refiner could suffer the statutory requirement for disproportionate economic hardship. And that is the standard by which the Clean Air Act allows a small refiner, a small refinery, to qualify for an exemption.

So in ruling that EPA's denials were arbitrary and capricious, the court stated that EPA's rent price pass-through policy is, quote unquote, ""so implausible as applied to petitioners that it cannot be ascribed to a difference in viewer agency expertise."" The court went on to find that small refineries had justifiable reliance on the decades-long EPA practice of how they reviewed SREs. They relied upon the Department of Energy's scoring matrix as well as they found that there was a protectable property interest in the statutory right to an exemption if the small refinery could demonstrate disproportionate economic hardship. So the venue part of this case is what was appealed to the Supreme Court. So Zach, why don't you give us some background on the Oklahoma case?

Zach Pilchen: Thanks Susan. So the Clean Air Act creates, for air quality purposes, this program that primarily relies on state plans to implement federal National Ambient Air Quality Standards. And whenever EPA revises those federal National Ambient Air Quality Standards —or NAAQS, we call them — that kicks off a whole round of state submissions and deadlines for how those standards are going to be implemented in those states. And one of the requirements is that states prevent emissions from their state from significantly contributing to air quality problems in downwind states. We call this the interstate air pollution, interstate transport or Good Neighbor program under the Clean Air Act. And each state has a responsibility, in the first instance, to submit something that EPA can review to determine whether it actually is eliminating that upwind air quality problem. In 2015, EPA triggered that SIP process when it strengthened the NAAQS for ozone. And it received a number of state implementation plan submissions, and it looked at them and disapproved 21 states' plans simultaneously in one Federal Register notice for failing to comply with that Good Neighbor provision. That allowed the agency to then establish its own federal implementation plan for how to address ozone pollution, ozone transport under the new NAAQS.

Now, EPA aggregated all of these plans together in one Federal Register notice, and they applied this consistent four-step framework for how they looked at each of those 21 state plans. But there's a lot of technical analysis that's involved, a lot of modeling, a lot of very detailed information that has to be evaluated by the agency in making that decision. The agency, in simultaneously denying all 21 states' plans, said that these disapprovals would only be challenged in the D.C. Circuit.

And the agency actually took two arguments for why the D.C. Circuit was where the case had to be. They first said that this simultaneous action was a nationally applicable action in its own right and, therefore, the D.C. Circuit venue is mandatory. Alternatively, they said that if someone deemed any of this to be a local or regionally applicable action, then it nevertheless fell into that exception, which they were invoking, that it had nationwide scope or effect. EPA pointed to the consistent four-step framework that it used to help substantiate that. There was litigation that happened pretty quickly all over the country. A lot of people challenging that venue decision by suing in their local circuits rather than in the D.C. Circuit. And actually four out of five circuits held that EPA was incorrect, that these were local or regionally applicable actions. Only one circuit, the Tenth, agreed with EPA. And, you know, the court there held that the action was a single, nationally applicable action. You know, the agency, it looked at the action as the entire Federal Register package that was published on one single day. And because the agency had grouped all these individual state disapprovals into a single rule, that was the action. It had a broad geographic reach because it applied to so many states. The analysis that was used was consistent across states in terms of that four-step framework for determining disapproval or approval of the state plans, and accordingly held that venue actually should go in those challenges to the D.C. Circuit. And that's when the Supreme [Court] granted certiorari.

Andy, so you've heard all the background about the RFS case and the interstate transport case. What happened once this provision actually got to the Supreme Court?

Andy Kriha: Right, so as has been discussed fairly extensively already, this is a two-step process, right? Step one, is this a locally or regionally applicable action, or is this a nationally applicable action? And in both cases, the Supreme Court seemed relatively unbothered by this question. It thought that both were clearly locally or regionally applicable actions. And that makes sense to a certain extent, right? These are decisions that are acting on submissions of individual states or submissions of individual refineries. And they fundamentally apply to these individual entities that have made these applications. So then the court moved on to the second step of whether or not these actions are based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect. And so first, the court looked at the scope or effect language, and it found that a nationwide scope is something that applies throughout the entire country as a legal matter. Something that has nationwide effect is something that applies throughout the country as a practical matter. But what we really need to look at here is the ""based on"" language. And what was the basis of the determination? If this basis varied across these entities all over the country, then it's going to look a lot less nationwide, right? And if the basis of the determination is the same for all of these entities, then it starts to look a little bit more like a nationwide determination.

And so what the court really did in both cases was look into the methodology that EPA used and the factors that went into EPA's decision in each case. And if, you know, this was a single methodology that used a single set of inputs that applied to everybody equally, then it's a nationwide determination. Our case is going to the D.C. Circuit. Even if it's a single brand-new nationwide methodology, but you're inputting a lot of site-specific factors to actually make the determination of yes or no to a specific petition, then the court tells us that actually, this is not a nationwide action. This belongs in the regional circuit. And so what we saw was a divergence between the two different cases that kind of helps us draw where this line is. We saw on the example of Calumet where there was just this single determination that compliance costs are the only input and compliance costs, no matter where you're located, can always be passed through, because it's a national market. That's a nationwide determination. We're going to the D.C. Circuit. If we have these state plans where we're applying a single methodology, but now we input multiple factors, state-specific factors into those methodologies, then just because EPA grouped them all together and decided them at the same time doesn't make that a national action, right? There were still individual factors that each of these individual determinations are based on. And so we're going to end up going to the regional circuits.

And so Zach, can you tell us a little bit more then, with that framework in mind, how this applies to the state implementation plans that were at issue in the Oklahoma case and what happens next with that case?

Zach Pilchen: In Oklahoma, the Supreme Court unanimously held that EPA's coordinated disapprovals of all of those interstate transport SIPs, those were actually a big set of locally or regionally applicable actions. And that those individual actions were not based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect. The court rejected EPA's first argument that they were nationally applicable, and EPA had framed these as, you know, this is one big action affecting many states across many circuits. And the court said that, ""Hey, I hear you, but Section 307 specifically lists SIP approvals as local actions."" And this is just, you know, each of these individual actions is local and that disapproval is just the opposite side of the same coin as an approval. So these are local or regionally applicable actions. The fact that you packaged them all together and did them all simultaneously under one heading, that's not the appropriate unit for us to analyze. And the court also rejected the Tenth Circuit's proposition that these were nationally applicable actions because there had been this uniform statutory interpretation and four-step framework applied, and the court just explained that no, for determining at the outset whether something is national versus local or regional, you're looking at the geographic scope, not the reasoning. The reasoning is something that you kick in at the second step for local and regional about whether it was reasoning-wise, nevertheless based on something nationwide.

So having determined that these were local or regional actions, the court next looked at the EPA's backup: Are these nevertheless based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect such that, you know, EPA can shuttle these into the D.C. Circuit? And here, again, the court looked at EPA's reasoning for each action and somewhat contrasted it with the reasoning in Calumet. Whereas Calumet had a single legal theory or a couple of them and an economic theory that were essentially outcome-determinative, EPA here did have a single framework for evaluating SIPs, but there was this intensely factual detailed analysis that the EPA undertook to actually apply that framework, looking at modeling results, looking at cost of controls, looking at really complex state-specific, fact-specific issues. And because there was no big abstract legal or economic theory that was primarily driving the outcome, and instead it was ultimately turning on the facts that were relevant to each state, the court held that this was not quote-unquote, ""based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect,"" even though there were some nationwide frameworks and considerations that were providing the skeleton for the analysis.

Susan, do you want to talk about how that test applied in the Calumet case?

Susan Lafferty: Yeah, sure. I'll first mention that there was also a circuit split for the small refinery exemption cases where several courts did send their cases directly to the D.C. Circuit and the D.C. Circuit also received some cases just directly. And in August 2024, six or eight months after the Fifth Circuit case, they ruled in a case called Sinclair Wyoming Refining Company LLC v. EPA. And they essentially came out with the same outcome on the merits, that the RIN pass-through policy was arbitrary and capricious and the court impermissibly narrowed the Clean Air Act authority that they had been given. So then the Fifth Circuit, the venue, cert was granted. And in the Calumet case, the Supreme Court ruled — it was a 7-2 decision — as Andy said, concluding that EPA's published finding of nationwide scope or effect for its SRE denials was proper because the local SRE petition denials were based on determinations of nationwide scope or effect.

So, you know, again, as was indicated earlier, the EPA's RIN pass-through policy was really seen to be this sort of one policy that was applied consistently nationwide. And there really wasn't significant reliance on the facility-specific factual issues. And so the court did say, yes, these are individual refineries and individual circuit jurisdictions, but the way EPA came up with this policy and applied its policy and just the policy itself was really, was such that it was applicable on a nationwide scope. So that means that the Fifth Circuit case is now vacated and EPA's denials are no longer in effect. And this is now remanded back to the Fifth Circuit. It will, you know, it could be, now, since we have the D.C. Circuit case that I just mentioned, it's not clear exactly procedurally how the cases will be determined from there, but clearly, if it's now sent over to the D.C. Circuit, the D.C. Circuit has already decided RIN pass-through policy from the Biden EPA is arbitrary and capricious, which means that ultimately all these petitions end up back at EPA to be reconsidered. And we find ourselves with, you know, the Trump EPA being basically told you've got to come up with a new, a new way of looking at all of these pending SREs, at least for all of the cases that were remanded, because of these two court hearings, court determinations. And that was, that's mostly the petitions from 2021 and earlier that were at, at issue here.

We think that, you know, EPA could still deny some or even all of the petitions, but they certainly couldn't do it based on the RIN pass-through policy. They will need to consider RFS compliance costs, which certainly largely, or maybe solely, will be based on the price of obtaining RINs to retire for your compliance costs. But the court, D.C. Circuit court, also said EPA should have looked more at the other statutory requirement to consider other economic factors, said that that is definitely broader than just mere RIN costs. So we will need to see what EPA decides to count as other economic factors.

One thing that the D.C. Circuit did not do that the Fifth Circuit did, was the D.C. Circuit said they, because they had determined that the policy was arbitrary and capricious, they were not going to look at the issue of whether or not the denials were impermissibly retroactive. So the Fifth Circuit had looked at that and said, yes, they are. So in theory, EPA could decide, at least again for these 2021 and earlier petitions that are at issue, they could decide to use some approach that is different from the DOE matrix that was in place when these small refiner petitions were filed. But if they use something other than the DOE matrix, and the small refiners don't like the outcome, i.e., they're denied again, we think there's a really high chance that they're going to end up in court. And one of the arguments would be that there was reliance upon the fact that when the small refinery submitted their petition, the DOE matrix was in practice and was the way that EPA would evaluate whether the small refinery was suffering disproportionate economic harm and deserved a waiver or not from rent obligations.

So we think EPA is certainly considering all of those factors and will most likely, we expect, this is speculation, but my expectation — we can see what Andy thinks — is that EPA would like to clear these petitions in the next few months. And whether or not they really take pains to keep it in the D.C. Circuit, so take pains to try and make sure their approach appears to satisfy that box for nationwide scope and effect. Or are they going to take the position, which is certainly what most small refiners would like, that each are literally individual adjudications, and while they're all looking at whether or not there's disproportionate economic harm, it's going to be a bit more bespoke, at least in all of the information going into whether it's the DOE matrix or another more generic methodology. And that could mean that any lawsuits that follow are filed in individual circuit courts rather than the D.C. Circuit. So EPA's got a lot to sort of wrestle with, I think, in the SRE cases because, while this one came out that D.C. Circuit was the proper venue, I don't think that that's a slam dunk for future actions. So, Andy, tell me where I went wrong.

Andy Kriha: No, I generally agree with that. I'll note on the timing issue, there are a lot of other factors at play as well that could each be their own podcast. So we won't go any deeper into them other than to say there's still some five-year-old litigation hanging out in the D.C. Circuit about how SRE petitions get factored into setting volume obligations under the RVO. That could be decided potentially by the end of the year, early next year. Obviously, EPA is going through the middle of a volume obligation rulemaking right now that also makes a handful of other small changes to the RFS. And so all that plays into timing, but I think at the end of the day I agree with you. They probably want to get these decisions on these backlogged SREs out sooner rather than later.

And yeah, in terms of what it means for SREs going forward, I think it is going to be a lot harder in the future for EPA to get SRE decisions into the D.C. Circuit if that's where they want them. I think historically, again, that probably is where they've wanted them, but different administrations may have different views. Just because the D.C. Circuit did note that there are several other factors other than RFS compliance costs that need to play into these decisions, that some of these factors are inherently going to be local market factors or highly likely to be local market factors. And so it's, I think it's going to be a tall order for EPA to shoehorn some of these decisions into something that looks like it's based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect. And I think that's true fairly broadly as we now transition into the impacts of this, beyond just these particular cases. I think this entire class of actions, things, you know, like SIPs, like SRE determinations, anything that's a petition where you're making determinations about individual entities, individual states, things like that, are going to be much harder to get into the D.C. Circuit going forward, notwithstanding this decision in Calumet. But, you never know. We'll see how EPA acts, and we'll see if possibly I'm wrong.

But Zach, I know you want to jump in. You definitely have thoughts about the broader implications of these cases as well.

Zach Pilchen: Well, I just want to stay on that RFS thing because that's a very interesting concept, that, you know, EPA makes this based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect, ends up in the D.C. Circuit, which tells it that it has to take a more particularized approach. Then I suppose on remand to the agency, it takes that particularized approach, and now it can't get back into the D.C. Circuit that told it needed to take that more particularized approach. That's just kind of an interesting quirk there on the RFS side.

Andy Kriha: Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, we'll see how it goes. I think this administration more than others might be OK with that, just on where we think they might come out on some of these determinations, but all remains to be seen.

Zach Pilchen: Yeah, I mean, you know, that's, I think something worth emphasizing here, is that, you know, there was some restrictions on EPA in this decision. You know, there was no, of course, without deference, there was no deference to the agency's interpretation at all on how to read the venue provision. In fact, if anything, there was an extreme amount of dictionary definitions in this case. I think six or seven different nouns and adjectives getting just interpreted pursuant to various dictionary definitions, which is kind of its own interesting view of this court's turn towards relying very heavily on textualism. But for EPA, even despite those limits, the agency still remains very much in the catbird’s seat in terms of being able to somewhat at least control where its actions are challenged. So this whole D.C. Circuit exception that the court is talking about and whether something is based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect, that still relies on the agency to invoke that exception. So even local and regional actions that are based on the determination of nationwide scope or effect, if EPA doesn't choose to flip the lever, those still go to the local circuits. And in many cases, perhaps EPA will want to do that and prefer that as compared to some of the D.C. Circuit precedent.

At the same time, to the extent that the agency has some control that hasn't been cabined by courts over how it approaches some of these issues, it can also structure its determinations to either be nationally applicable or regionally applicable actions. And so I'll give you, you know, there are lots of examples. And, you know, in the last Trump Administration, for example, there was an action that was being challenged in the D.C. Circuit affecting many states that the court was prepared to hear oral arguments. And as part of the repeal efforts, these were startup/shutdown malfunction provisions in state plans, the first Trump Administration repealed them somewhat in piecemeal. Even though the legal theory was consistent throughout, the Trump Administration repealed just as to a few states here and there of creating somewhat smaller, cleaner, local or regionally applicable — clearly locally and regionally — applicable actions that nevertheless might have been based on nationwide determinations, but that weren't being invoked. And then you got those decisions in the Fifth Circuit and Eighth Circuit, I think.

This administration is embarking on a pretty ambitious deregulatory agenda. The administrator announced 31 deregulatory actions, although some of those actions are multiple actions. And close to half of those are things under the Clean Air Act. And so as they decide what they're doing and how they're doing it, they are likely to be thinking very much about this decision and down the road — where are these actions going to be challenged? And structuring some of their actions to account for that to the extent that they can.",https://www.hklaw.com/-/media/images/twittercards/hk_opengraph.png?rev=ec0d75523b1f4e68920e3e1b42304866&sc_lang=en&hash=3345DDE33F8D43A99B42BABA11D22AF8,N,,2025-07-07 12:26:00.154650

“This bill is anything but beautiful for Washington.

At a time when we should be advancing clean energy, these rollbacks are a disastrous step in the wrong direction.”

The Governor cited projections from the U.S. Climate Alliance estimating that 21,800 Washingtonians could lose their jobs by 2030 due to reductions in clean energy and manufacturing tax credits.

The legislation, according to the Governor’s Office, also poses risks to Washington’s energy security and electric grid reliability by stifling the development of solar, wind, and battery resources during a time of increasing electricity demand.

One summer day in 2017, a front-page story in the StarNews of Wilmington, North Carolina, shook up the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of “forever” PFAS chemicals.

It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.

In the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump’s first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.

In its big-picture PFAS action plan from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds — PFOA and PFOS — in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.

By the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan’s suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated, standards were finalized under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.

But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will delay enforcement on the drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, “used flawed science and didn’t follow proper rulemaking procedures” for GenX.

These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.

At the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants — the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA’s budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.

Pointing to earlier announcements on its approach to the chemicals, the EPA told ProPublica that it’s “committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.”

“If anything,” the agency added, “the Trump administration’s historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.”

In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Firefighting-foam-FPAS.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:25:36.402160

The North Carolina Utilities Commission will hold a technical conference on October 14 to address “the rising prevalence of large electric load additions in the region,” it said last month.

The commission’s order cited “growing reliability concerns related to large electric load integration,” pointing to North American Electric Reliability Corporation analyses of more than two dozen recent voltage-sensitive load loss events related to data centers and cryptocurrency mines in the Mid-Atlantic and Texas.

The move came less than a month after Duke Energy updated its periodic large electric load forecast to 5.9 GW by 2035, an increase of nearly 2 GW from 12 months earlier, and after Amazon announced it would invest an estimated $10 billion in North Carolina data centers.

Dive Insight:

In its technical conference order, the commission asked Duke and Dominion to weigh in on whether new tariffs should be developed for some or all customers above a certain demand threshold; whether those tariffs should address customer self-generation, sensitivity to grid disturbances and other reliability issues; cost allocation and potential “stranded cost issues” for new large loads; and possible modifications to North Carolina’s interconnection procedures needed to accommodate large loads.

The commission also asked the utilities to provide updates on ongoing negotiations with data centers and other large load customers, including plans for backup generation, co-location with generating facilities and “measures that will need to be implemented to ensure grid reliability and fair cost to customers” for such co-located facilities.

Tyler Norris, a Duke University Ph.D student and former renewables development executive who published a widely cited paper on large-load flexibility earlier this year, said North Carolina lacks the transparency needed for the public to gauge the potential impact of proposed large loads on utility rates, the environment and the state’s progress toward its legislative mandate for 100% carbon-neutral electricity by 2050.

“Like most states, North Carolina has no interconnection procedures or transparency standards for large loads, which means at this time there’s essentially no information available about the proposed facility,” Norris said.

Amazon, for example, did not disclose a potential load for its North Carolina data center investment in its early June announcement. But based on the most likely design specifications, it could eventually be between 600 MW and 900 MW, Norris said.

“The facility’s power rating can’t be known without more detail,” he said. “We don’t know how much power the facility will use, what upgrades it will require, how much those upgrades will cost or who will pay, whether it will include on-site generation or storage, participate in demand response or procure clean electricity.”

Duke Energy’s most recent wholesale load forecast, issued in May, includes “two discrete projects that ramp up over the planning period and will total nearly 900 MWs by 2035,” the commission said in the order.

“Duke Energy’s advanced system planning for the Carolinas is guided by a stringent regulatory process designed to ensure infrastructure investments are grounded in sound load forecasts,” Duke Energy spokesperson Garrett Poorman told Utility Dive in an email.

While the total number of potential large load customers in advanced development stayed roughly the same from 2024, Duke’s May forecast shows a nearly 50% jump in expected future wholesale loads due to an increase in average project capacity, the utility said. Of 35 projects in advanced development, nine projects totaling 540 MW have executed energy service agreements and 22 projects totaling 4,669 MW have executed letters of intent to interconnect, the commission said.

Duke’s forecast includes potential large loads to be served by North Carolina electric cooperatives or municipal utilities that purchase wholesale power from the utility, the commission noted.

Last year, Duke proposed a new electricity tariff in the Carolinas to support large-load customers’ clean electricity goals without raising costs for other ratepayers. The proposed Accelerating Clean Electricity tariff would initially serve Amazon, Google Microsoft and Nucor, a Charlotte-based steelmaker with significant operations in the region, and “facilitate beneficial on-site generation at customer facilities, participation in load flexibility programs and investments in clean energy assets,” Duke said.

Poorman, the spokesman for Duke, said the utility is taking additional measures to mitigate large loads’ impacts on other ratepayers.

“We’re evolving our performance provisions and contracts to ensure large-load customers appropriately pay for the cost to serve them, including termination penalties and minimum bills if we make infrastructure upgrades to serve a new customer whose plans subsequently change,” Poorman said.

He also said robust planning could mitigate some impacts, including siting some energy-intensive customers in areas where the utility already has robust transmission infrastructure and capacity, reducing the need for new grid infrastructure.

Meanwhile, Dominion Energy’s 2024 integrated resource plan for Virginia and North Carolina shows 8,012 MW in data center energy service agreements through 2032, the commission said. Given Dominion’s relatively small footprint in North Carolina, much of that capacity is likely in Virginia, where the commission flagged two major recent load loss events that it said underscore reliability concerns in grid zones where transmission-connected large loads are common.

Earlier this month, the North Carolina Legislature passed a bill that would have encouraged new natural gas and nuclear generation by eliminating the state’s interim power-sector emissions-reduction target of 70% by 2030. It would have also allowed public utilities to charge customers for baseload electric generating facilities “outside of a general rate case if the Utilities Commission determines there is an overall cost savings for customers over the life of the generating facility.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/tt0_i0b83KlzDW9yYOJZydRkahz0A1yLbRO_emVDm6w/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTYxMzk0MjE5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-07 11:24:22.993177

Earlier today, the House passed President Trump's sweeping tax and spending legislation after overcoming resistance from some Republican members. A revised version of the legislation narrowly passed the Senate on July 1 in a reconciliation package, with Vice President Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The final legislation will now be sent to the President for signing.

Clean energy tax incentives fared little better in the final version than in the prior version. However, the final version allows solar and wind projects to claim the full tax credits if they either begin construction within 12 months after enactment or are placed in service by December 31, 2027, but otherwise terminates them completely for new projects. Treatment of other clean energy technologies such as geothermal, hydroelectric, nuclear, hydrogen and fuel cells were saved from the chopping block in the final version.

Significantly, the final bill does not include the excise tax contained in the earlier Senate version that would have applied to facilities receiving assistance from prohibited foreign entities, which include businesses or organizations with strong links to China. Senate Republicans agreed to remove the excise tax in order to try and arrive at a version of the bill that could win approval in both the House and Senate.

In the Senate, Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina all voted against the bill. Tillis stood against the bill over concerns for cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who was thought to be another holdout on the bill, ended up voting in favor of the final Senate version. All Democrats in the Senate voted against it. In the House, Republicans Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania both voted against the bill. All Democrats in the House voted against it.

The final changes to the more significant energy tax credits include:

Solar and Wind Projects. Solar and wind projects that begin construction within one year after the date of enactment will qualify for the current clean electricity investment tax credit (ITC) (Section 48E) and clean electricity production tax credit (PTC) (Section 45Y) established under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Wind and solar projects beginning construction after that time, however, will have to be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits. Energy storage technology built at solar and wind facilities is not subject to these deadlines.

Batteries and Other Energy Technologies. Batteries (including, as noted, batteries at solar and wind projects) and electric generating technologies other than solar and wind – such as geothermal, hydropower, and nuclear—remain eligible for 100% of the current tax credits if the project begins construction by the end of 2033, after which a three-year phase-out begins before the credits expire in 2036. A separate post on how these clean energy technologies fared in the final Senate bill is forthcoming.

Domestic Content Percentages. By way of a correction, the domestic content percentages for the clean electricity ITC have been revised to match the domestic content percentages for the clean electricity PTC.

Residential Solar and Wind Projects. The final bill retains the prohibition on the clean electricity ITC and PTC for solar and wind facilities that are rented or leased to homeowners.

Foreign Entity Involvement. The prohibited foreign entity provisions are largely unchanged from the prior Senate version. For any project beginning construction after 2025, tax credits will not be available for taxpayers that are prohibited foreign entities or if construction includes any material assistance from a ""prohibited foreign entity."" ""Material assistance"" is measured by a cost ratio that measures the percentage of manufactured products and components incorporated into the project that do not involve prohibited foreign entities. In addition, the final bill retains the statute of limitations extension to 6 years and new penalties for errors in determining whether a project received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity and for certain certification failures relating to whether prohibited foreign entities were involved in the manufacturing of property or components. Beginning two years after the bill is signed into law, the ITC will be subject to recapture if certain payments are made to a specified foreign entity during the 10-year period after the project is placed in service.

Transferability of ITC and PTC. The final bill generally retains transferability of credits until their repeal under the IRA (Section 6418). However, tax credits cannot be transferred to a ""specified foreign entity."" Projects will still need to satisfy the beginning of construction and placed-in-service deadlines described above to avoid phase-out or elimination of the ITC or PTC.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits. The final bill adds metallurgical coal, which is mainly exported to countries like India and Brazil for use in making steel, to the list of appliable critical materials eligible for the advanced manufacturing production credit (Section 45X). The Section 45X credit is eliminated for wind energy components produced and sold after 2027 and begins a three-year phaseout for the production of critical minerals (other than metallurgical coal) in 2031. The credit for metallurgical coal terminates at the end of 2029. Beginning in 2026, no credit is available to a taxpayer that is a prohibited foreign entity nor is any credit allowed for any component that is the subject of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.

Commercial Clean Vehicles. The tax credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles (Section 45W)—like the personal clean vehicle credit (Section 30D)—is eliminated for all such vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025, as compared to the prior Senate version, which allowed the tax credit for commercial vehicles acquired within 6 months after the bill is signed into law. The critical mineral and battery component restrictions for smaller commercial vehicles were stripped from the bill.

Charging Stations. Tax credits for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property (Section 30C) are eliminated for property placed in service after December 31, 2025, as compared to the prior bill's allowance for property placed in service up to one year after the bill is signed into law.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit. The bill extends the Section 45V clean hydrogen production credit to include any project that begins construction by January 1, 2028, as compared to the December 31, 2025 deadline contained in the prior version.

The Subcommittee on Environment of the United States House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee held a June 26th Hearing titled:

A Decade Later: A Review of Congressional Action, Environmental Protection Agency Rules, and Beneficial Use Opportunities for Coal Ash (“Hearing”).

The stated focus of the Hearing was to:

… discuss how coal ash can be used safely and effectively in construction as well for the remining of critical materials.

Coal ash is often also referred to as coal combustion residuals, or CCRs. It is produced primarily from the burning of coal and coal-fired power plants.

Coal ash includes a number of biproducts produced from burning coal, which can include:

Fly ash.

Bottom ash.

Boiler slag.

Flue gas desulfurization material.

The disposal or reuse of coal ash can depend on:

Type of bi-product.

Processes at the plant.

Applicable regulations.

Coal ash can and is often reused in various ways which can produce:

Environmental benefits.

Economic benefits.

Product benefits.

The state environmental agencies have traditionally been primarily responsible for regulating the beneficial use of coal ash. Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, coal ash is excluded from federal hazardous waste regulations. Nevertheless, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has promulgated rules that regulate the disposal of coal ash. The EPA rules address the handling, storing, and maintenance of coal ash. Further, in 2024, EPA expanded its regulatory requirements to address coal ash storage at inactive power plant sites and other previously closed locations.

In preparation for the June 26th Hearing, the Majority Staff of the Subcommittee developed a Memorandum addressing:

CCRs.

Regulation of coal ash.

Issues for discussion.

The issues for discussion at the Hearing included:

The status of EPA’s implementation of section 2301 of the WIIN Act providing authority under RCRA for EPA and states to regulate coal ash through permit programs.

The role states can play in effectively regulating coal ash and barriers that may inhibit states from seeking EPA approval of state permit programs.

The impact of EPA’s coal ash regulations on the electric utility sector and the general public.

Environmental benefits of using coal ash and the potential of coal ash to serve as a reliable domestic source of rare earth elements.

The witnesses at the Hearing included:

Congressman Dan Meuser, Congressional District 9, has released a public statement after voting in favor of H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). The legislation passed on the afternoon of July 3 with a 218 to 214 vote before being sent to President Trump for final approval.

The following is Congressman Meuser's full statement.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill is a direct response to what the American people have demanded — secure borders, lower costs, greater opportunity, and an accountable government that works for them, not against them.

This bill makes permanent the tax relief passed in President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and prevents the largest tax increase in American history. If Congress did not pass the OBBB, we’d be guaranteeing a $4 trillion tax hike on the American people — raising taxes on 165 million taxpayers and over 33 million small businesses.

For families in Pennsylvania, this bill’s passage means avoiding a $2,500 tax hike, preserving the full $30,000 standard deduction, and expanding the Child Tax Credit to $2,200 for 1.4 million Pennsylvania households. For small businesses — which make up 99.6% of Pennsylvania employers — it makes permanent immediate R&D expensing, 100% bonus depreciation, and the 20% small business deduction, protecting more than 960,000 job creators across the Commonwealth. It also protects 49,000 family-owned farms in the Commonwealth from having their Estate Tax exemption reduced by half.

The OBBB supports working families in every corner of the country. It eliminates taxes on tips and overtime through 2028, creates a $6,000 senior deduction, and launches Trump Investment Accounts for every child born between 2025 and 2028—giving families a stake in our nation’s economic future from day one.

As well, it secures our border by completing the physical barrier, expanding personnel, and giving ICE and Border Patrol the resources they need to do their job. It unleashes American energy by ending costly mandates, repealing wasteful subsidies, restarting lease sales, and restarting domestic production. And it puts our budget on a more sustainable path—delivering $1.2 trillion in mandatory savings, the largest deficit reduction package in nearly 30 years.

And importantly, this bill strengthens Medicaid for those it was intended to support. It includes common-sense work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, removes individuals who are ineligible under the law from the rolls, and, beginning in October 2026, it ends the federal cost-share for states that choose to include illegal immigrants in their Medicaid programs—taking serious steps to address waste, fraud, and abuse in the program. It also delivers support for rural healthcare, creating a $50 billion fund to help rural hospitals and ensure continued access to care. We’re making Medicaid more sustainable, more accountable, and more focused on delivering real results for seniors, the disabled, and low-income families.

The Big Beautiful Bill is essential to correcting course for our country, but it is just the beginning of our work to make America as great as it can be.

Syria's largest city was mostly pitch-black, the few speckles of light coming from the other households able to afford solar panels, batteries, or private generators.

Al-Jenan went thousands of dollars in debt to buy his solar panel in 2019. It was an expensive coping mechanism at the time, but without it, he couldn't charge his phone and run the refrigerator.

Syria has not had more than four hours of state electricity per day for years, as a result of the nearly 14-year civil war that ended with the ouster of former President Bashar Assad in December.

Syria's new leaders are hoping renewable energy will now become more than a patchwork solution. Investment is beginning to return to the country with the lifting of U.S. sanctions, and major energy projects are planned, including an industrial-scale solar farm that would secure about a tenth of the country's energy needs.

“The solution to the problem isn’t putting solar panels on roofs,” Syria’s interim Energy Minister Mohammad al-Bashir told The Associated Press. “It’s securing enough power for the families through our networks in Syria. This is what we’re trying to do.”

Restoring the existing energy infrastructure

Some of the efforts focus on simply repairing infrastructure destroyed in the war. The World Bank recently announced a $146 million grant to help Syria repair damaged transmission lines and transformer substations. Al-Bashir said Syria's infrastructure that has been repaired can provide 5,000 megawatts, about half the country's needs, but fuel and gas shortages have hampered generation. With the sanctions lifted, that supply could come in soon.

More significantly, Syria recently signed a $7 billion energy deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and American companies. The program over the next three and a half years would develop four combined-cycle gas turbines with a total generating capacity estimated at approximately 4,000 megawatts and a 1,000-megawatt solar farm. This would “broadly secure the needs” of Syrians, said Al-Bashir.

While Syria is initially focusing on fixing its existing fossil fuel infrastructure to improve quality of life, help make businesses functional again, and entice investors, the U.N. Development Program said in May that a renewable energy plan will be developed in the next year for the country.

The plan will look at Syria’s projected energy demand and determine how much of it can come from renewable sources.

“Given the critical role of energy in Syria’s recovery, we have to rapidly address energy poverty and progressively accelerate the access to renewable energy,” Sudipto Mukerjee, UNDP’s resident representative in Syria, said in a statement announcing the plan.

Sanctions crippled the power grid

While the war caused significant damage to Syria's infrastructure, crippling Washington-led sanctions imposed during the Assad dynasty's decades of draconian rule made it impossible for Syria to secure fuel and spare parts to generate power.

“Many companies over the past period would tell us the sanctions impact matters like imports, implementing projects, transferring funds and so on,” al-Bashir said.

During a visit to Turkey in May, the minister said Syria could only secure about 1700 megawatts, a little less than 20%, of its energy needs.

A series of executive orders by U.S. President Donald Trump lifted many sanctions on Syria, aiming to end the country’s isolation from the global banking system so that it can become viable again and rebuild itself.

The United Nations estimates the civil war caused hundreds of billions of dollars in damages and economic losses across the country. Some 90% of Syrians live in poverty. Buying solar panels, private generators or other means of producing their own energy has been out of reach for most of the population.

“Any kind of economic recovery needs a functional energy sector,” said Joseph Daher, Syrian-Swiss economist and researcher, who said that stop-gap measures like solar panels and private generators were luxuries only available to a few who could afford it. “There is also a need to diminish the cost of electricity in Syria, which is one of the most expensive in the region.”

Prices for electricity in recent years surged as the country under its former rulers struggled with currency inflation and rolling back on subsidies. The new officials who inherited the situation say that lifting sanctions will help them rectify the country's financial and economic woes, and provide sufficient and affordable electricity as soon as they can.

“The executive order lifts most of the obstacles for political and economic investment with Syria,"" said Qutaiba Idlibi, who leads the Americas section of the Foreign Ministry.

Syria has been under Washington-led sanctions for decades, but designations intensified during the war that started in 2011. Even with some waivers for humanitarian programs, it was difficult to bring in resources and materials to fix Syria’s critical infrastructure — especially electricity — further compounding the woes of the vast majority of Syrians, who live in poverty.

The focus is economic recovery

The removal of sanctions signals to U.S. businesses that Trump is serious in his support for Syria's recovery, Idlibi said.

“Right now, we have a partnership with the United States as any normal country would do,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Al-Jenan is able to turn on both his fans on a hot summer day while he watches the afternoon news on TV, as the temperature rises to 35 degrees Celsius (95 F). He doesn’t want to let go of his solar panel but hopes the lifting of sanctions will eventually bring sustainable state electricity across the country.

“We can at least know what’s going on in the country and watch on TV,” he said. “We really were cut off from the entire world.”

Output from coal plants in major markets including Germany, France and Spain is poised to jump 50% this month compared with June, according to a forecast by BloombergNEF. That’s in response to a 40% plunge in wind power estimated by Energy Aspects Ltd. for July and August.

The likely comeback for the region’s legacy fossil-fuel plants shows just how important they are even after utilities have spent decades and a fortune to expand the renewable energy sector. When solar generation surges during spring and summer months, there isn’t yet an effective way of storing all the electricity that the panels generate. The same holds true for wind.

Over the past few weeks, temperatures have approached 40C (104F) in some places in Germany. During the evening of July 1, hourly electricity prices jumped to €557.34 per megawatt-hour on the EPEX Spot SE exchange in Paris, or almost 9 times higher than the lowest period for that day.

“The longer the wind lull continues amid the scorching heat, the longer fossil fuels will have to fill the evening demand gap in power markets,” said Florence Schmit, energy strategist at Rabobank.

Wind generation surged to a record in June in both Germany and the UK, according to data from the European Energy Exchange. July’s expected slump would be a throwback to last winter and spring when output was much lower than normal and plants burning fossil fuels plants had to boost output to help keep the lights on.

Emissions from European Union power plants this month could jump by 14% compared with in June, according to a BloombergNEF forecast.

German next-month power futures are trading at €80.94 per megawatt hour, about a third higher than in April when cooling demand had not yet ramped up in Europe.

H.R. 1, President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” was signed into law on July 4, 2025. The sweeping legislation proposes to end a number of climate-focused funding programs and emissions regulations. The bill affects nearly every sector of the economy, but it hits heavy-duty trucks — both electric and diesel-powered — especially hard.

For fleet managers managers, this bill sends a clear message. The federal government is stepping back from its clean truck investment strategy.

EV Tax Credits on the Chopping Block

One of the most immediate impacts of H.R. 1 is the proposed repeal of the Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit under Section 45W of the Internal Revenue Code. Fleets have used this credit, which provides up to $40,000 per vehicle for eligible commercial electric trucks, to offset the high cost of electrification. The bill terminates this credit outright. Section 112003 cuts off a major financial incentive for adopting battery-electric Class 6–8 trucks.

The section states:

IN GENERAL. — No credit shall be determined under this section with respect to any vehicle acquired after December 31, 2025.

(2) EXCEPTION FOR BINDING CONTRACTS. — Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to vehicles placed in service before January 1, 2033, and acquired pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before May 12, 2025.

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE. — The amendment made by this section shall apply to vehicles acquired after December 31, 2025.

The bill also proposes to eliminate the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (Section 112004), which helps subsidize the cost of EV charging infrastructure.

IN GENERAL. — Section 30C(i) is amended by striking ‘‘December 31, 2032’’ and inserting ‘‘December

31, 2025’’.

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE. — The amendment made by this section shall apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2025.

For fleet shops that have been evaluating or installing high-voltage equipment to support EV charging, this removal could shift return-on-investment timelines significantly.

Natural Gas Infrastructure Impacted

It’s important to note that the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (Section 112004) also includes tax incentives for installing refueling stations for alternative fuels — including compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Fleets that plan to adopt natural gas trucks based on the installation of infrastructure will lose a key incentive that helps mitigate that cost.",https://s18391.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Volvo-VNR-Electric-Charging.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 12:24:20.934013

“We know that the federal government is going to be completely useless in our efforts to clean the air, despite rhetoric claiming they care about clean air.

Conservatives say the air board is an unelected board that wields too much power.
Experts and advocates say California will have to approach clean air policy from many angles — mandates and incentives.","At an electric vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Christopher Grundler — one of the top executives in California responsible for cleaning the air — said despite all the setbacks his agency has faced this year, he’s confident the state can keep making progress.

“This president, this Congress, will not kill the electric car,” said Grundler, a deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources Board. “They won’t kill the electric truck, and they certainly won’t kill the California spirit.”

Despite that optimism, California officials — now reined in by the Trump administration and growing concerns about affordability and costs — are struggling to come up with new ways to clean up the nation’s most polluted air.

Lacking federal permission to set aggressive emission standards for the first time in almost 60 years, California may be left mainly with voluntary agreements with the auto, trucking and rail industries, and subsidies to entice consumers into buying electric vehicles.

Congress last month revoked the state’s authority to implement three landmark rules that ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and phase out diesel trucks. In addition, California was forced to abandon four other ambitious rules for zero-emission trucks, locomotives and commercial harbor craft because the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency would be unlikely to grant waivers.

Those seven mandates, now unenforceable, were key to cleaning up the pollutants that leave about 34 million Californians regularly breathing unhealthy air. In another blow to California’s efforts, Congress and President Donald Trump eliminated tax credits for consumers who buy electric cars.

At the same time, California’s air quality rules are facing growing pushback from the public, industry — and even some Democrats in the Legislature — because of the impacts on gas prices and other economic concerns.

Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, in an interview with CalMatters, did not offer any details on how the agency will make up for the voluminous tons of smog-causing gases and soot those rules would have eliminated.

“There’s no one strategy that’s going to work. It’s really going to need to be a suite of different things,” Randolph said. The governor and Legislature will help decide “what strategies are going to be the most effective, the most cost effective, the most likely to be able to scale up,” she said.

The air board is hosting four meetings in the coming weeks to hear ideas from industry groups, environmentalists and community members about how the state should now approach clean air regulation.

In an executive order last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom directed the air board to develop a new zero-emission car mandate — apparently in preparation for when the state either wins its lawsuit against Trump or when he leaves office.

Newsom also ordered the air board to develop a plan by Aug. 11 to keep expanding California’s market for electric cars and trucks. As part of the plan, the state agency must consider ways to improve charging infrastructure and offer incentives.

“We know that the federal government is going to be completely useless in our efforts to clean the air, despite rhetoric claiming they care about clean air. State and local governments are going to have to do more,” said Adrian Martinez, an attorney with the San Francisco-based environmental group Earthjustice.

“We just have to go it alone.”

Heart and lungs at stake

It’s been a long, bumpy road to cleaning up exhaust from California’s 36 million vehicles. Gas-powered cars and diesel trucks remain the state’s largest sources of smog and soot despite decades of cutting emissions.

Much of that pollution is inhaled by the most vulnerable Black and brown communities near ports, highways and warehouses. Ozone, a smog-causing gas, and fine particles of soot are linked to premature deaths from heart attacks and respiratory diseases, and increased emergency room visits.

For six decades, a provision in the Clean Air Act has granted California the power to set its own vehicle standards that are stricter than the federal government’s because of the state’s unique and severe air pollution problem.

But last month, Congress invoked the Congressional Review Act to repeal waivers granted by the Biden administration. The state in its lawsuit called this an unlawful action by Congress.

John Dunlap III, who served as California Air Resources Board chair under Gov. Pete Wilson in the 1990s, said in an interview with CalMatters that the Newsom administration “pushed too fast, and I think there were some holes” in their zero-emission car and truck rules.

Dunlap said by moving forward despite concerns about inadequate charging infrastructure, cost and the impacts on trucking, California regulators sent their critics straight into the arms of a more sympathetic federal government.

“They’ve been all in on zero-emission technology, which is great. It’s been a priority. But, they haven’t really cared to dialogue much, if at all, with the users of technology, particularly truck fleets,” he said. Dunlap was chair in 1996 when the board repealed deadlines requiring sales of electric cars because the technology wasn’t ready.

Under the landmark rule adopted by the air board in 2022, all new cars sold in California would have to be zero emissions beginning with 2035 models, ramping up from 68% in 2030. For trucks, California enacted two rules, one in 2020 and then one in 2023 that would phase out new diesel trucks by 2042. None will now be implemented.

Automakers say the rules were too aggressive and would have led to manufacturing job losses, higher car prices and limited consumer choices.

“The auto industry has invested billions in electrification and has 144 electrified models on the market right now. Again, the concerns were about the mandate – not the technology,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in a statement.

Conservatives say the air board is an unelected board that wields too much power. (Its members include appointees from Newsom and the Legislature, and local elected officials.) A Democrat in the Legislature last month urged Randolph, the board’s chair, to resign because the agency hasn’t analyzed the economic costs of its rules.

One new clean-air rule, the revamped Low Carbon Fuel Standard implemented last week, was met with widespread, vehement criticism from elected officials and industry since it will raise the price of gasoline by an unknown amount.

Amid concerns about the costs to consumers, the Trump administration and industry groups also are making it difficult for local agencies to take bold action.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District — responsible for regulating industrial plants and products that pollute the LA basin’s air — recently rejected rules phasing in zero-emission water heaters and furnaces.

The rules would have brought one of the biggest pollution reductions that the district has implemented in decades. But business groups and others were strongly opposed, saying fees imposed on manufacturers would raise the cost of products. And U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli threatened the local air district with a lawsuit if it approved the rule.

South Coast district Board Chair Vanessa Delgado and Executive Officer Wayne Nastri rejected multiple requests for interviews with CalMatters about what they plan to do next to clean the air in the LA basin.

“As you know, 80% of emissions in our region come from mobile sources — planes, trains, ships, heavy-duty trucks — all of which we do not have federal regulatory authority over,” said Nahal Mogharabi, spokesperson for the agency.

She directed all questions to Trump’s EPA.

What else can the state do?

Last month at the clean-vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Brett Ivy, a fleet manager for the aerospace company Northrop Grumman, wandered through Angel Stadium’s parking lot, looking at electric trucks and machines that he could potentially buy for his company.

Ivy knows the state isn’t enforcing its truck mandates, so he doesn’t know what his bosses will direct him to do in the future. He said they could abandon electric vehicles altogether.

But Ivy added, who knows what the next administration would bring, and Northrop Grumman has to think long-term. He wants to be prepared to do his job managing the company’s fleet of trucks.

“If we don’t, a new administration might reverse what (Trump) did,” he said. “Then you’re behind.”

The trucking industry, when the mandate was approved in 2023, predicted economic chaos and dysfunction and that it would “fail pretty spectacularly.” With its repeal, Nick Chiappe of the California Trucking Association expects that fleet owners will keep buying hydrogen and electric trucks when it makes economic sense, such as with smaller vehicles with shorter hauls.

“The industry will continue to work with (the air board) on reasonable steps to advance zero-emissions technology but maintain that the programs being rolled back were infeasible from the moment they were proposed,” Chiappe said.

Experts and advocates say California will have to approach clean air policy from many angles — mandates and incentives.

“There is still work that can be done,” said Martinez of Earthjustice. It’ll require “being creative and not losing steam,” he said. “These are big hits (from Trump) but I think still continuing to press on zero-emission vehicles is going to be really critical.”

Craig Segall, a former deputy executive officer for the state Air Resources Board, said the state should set new standards for cars and trucks. “The only thing that EPA is barred from doing is issuing substantially the same – not similar – waivers in the future,” he said. “The state can actually do quite a lot in terms of new standards.”

Segall said the state also should support companies that have already been buying zero-emission trucks with financing programs and get at the root of the transportation problem by expanding mass transit.

Offering incentives to consumers buying clean cars and trucks will be key. But Grundler, when asked whether California has the funds for more incentive programs, answered bluntly: No.

The state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, paid for by its cap and trade market program, typically has around $4 billion for programs related to climate change and air pollution. But because of the large deficit this year, the new budget allocated about $1.5 billion of those cap and trade funds to Cal Fire for fire prevention. It’s unclear how much will be left over for other projects.

In the state’s new budget, $132 million is allocated over the next fiscal year for an air board program offering incentives to truck fleet buyers.There also are creative ways that the state can encourage the purchase of electric cars, said Mary Nichols, the longtime chair of the air board under two previous governors and Newsom. Registration fees or sales taxes could be based on whether a car is gas-powered or electric, she said.

“The state of California has authority over everything relating to what cars can operate on our roads, as long as we’re not violating any constitutional requirements that deal with commerce between the states,” Nichols told CalMatters. “There’s a wide array of things that the state could do to make it clear that they don’t wish to continue having gasoline cars sold in the state of California.”

Tackling ‘pollution magnets‘

Experts say one of the most impactful policies the state could pursue without federal intervention could be regulating “pollution magnets.” These are hotspots, such as warehouses, ports and airports, that don’t directly pollute, but draw high-polluting vehicles, like diesel trucks and trains into communities.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District is developing a rule that would push the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports to install more charging stations for zero-emission trucks and cargo handling equipment. The district also approved a rule for warehouses that environmentalists call a success. These are known as “indirect source rules” since they regulate a place that is a hotspot.

These types of regulations “are definitely a leading strategy that California can continue to pursue environmental justice goals, despite the federal government being completely disinterested in environmental justice,” said Brennon Mendez, an environmental law and policy fellow at UCLA School of Law.

Polluting ports, airports and warehouses “should be held responsible for the air pollution that’s released into these neighborhoods because of their operations,” he said.

But while local air districts’ power to enact indirect source rules is well-established, the state’s power to do the same isn’t as clear.

A bill in the Legislature that enshrines the state’s power is opposed by labor and industry groups, especially now that the ports are facing economic uncertainty because of Trump’s tariffs. Assemblymember Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Rancho Cucamonga, said action on the bill is delayed until next year.

Also, a Senate bill would limit the South Coast district’s power to regulate the LA and Long Beach ports, requiring the agency to consider the costs and how ports and their tenants would be reimbursed, as well as the energy use and impacts on workers.

Randolph said it’s always been a struggle for California to slash enough emissions in California to achieve health standards, but now Trump’s actions “make the challenge even steeper and even harder.”

“The fundamental question,” she said, is “how do we continue to make progress…in the short-term and the long-term?”

Catastrophic flash floods in central Texas over the weekend have left at least 80 people dead, dozens still missing and entire neighbourhoods underwater.

A slow-moving storm brought heavy rainfall to the so-called hill country, a region of rocky hills, plains and valleys between San Antonio and Austin, overwhelming riverbanks and inundating small towns with water that rose faster than many could escape.

Among the hardest hit were children attending a summer camp along the banks of the Guadalupe River, where fast-rising water struck before dawn with little warning. At least 10 children and one counselor are still missing.

Officials have repeatedly referred to the event as a “100-year flood.” But that term might not reflect present and future risks.

Climate change is supercharging storms

Central Texas has long been known as ‘flash flood alley’ for its combination of steep terrain, tropical moisture and slow-moving storms – especially in July. But meteorologists say the scale of this week’s rainfall was anything but typical.

In Kerrville, more than 25 cm of rain fell in just three hours on Friday, according to the weather forecasting company AccuWeather. On Saturday, a separate storm west of Austin dropped nearly 35 cm of rain in just five hours.

In only a few hours in the town of Hunt, the Guadalupe River ballooned from about 2 metres to almost 9 – its second-biggest height on record, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).

For years, scientists have been sounding the alarm that climate change is intensifying extreme weather events – including flash floods – around the world.

Studies continue to show that warmer oceans and a wetter atmosphere are fuelling stronger and more frequent storms everywhere fromEurope toTornado Alley in the US.

Last year, researchers warned that climate change made the floods that ravaged Central Europetwice as likely. After storms inundated Greece with record rain and floods in late March this year, scientists from ClimaMeter revealed that similar storms are 10-15 per centwetter now than they would have been in the past.

In Texas, those effects were on stark display.

The combination of near-record water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, remnants of Tropical Storm Barry and the lack of a jet stream to blow it away funnelled extreme moisture into Texas. In retrospect, a warning sign that the floods could be historic.

“With climate change we have a warming atmosphere. A warmer atmosphere holds a lot more moisture, and we are seeing obviously much more total atmospheric moisture across the globe in recent years than we normally have,” Brett Anderson, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, told the AP.

Complex storms meet stretched resources

While some local officials have questioned the timing of weather alerts, NWS offices in Texas did issue a series of warnings in the days leading up to the floods, including a rare flash flood emergency that triggered mobile phone alerts.

But the challenge of forecasting where, when and how much rain will fall remains enormous. Predicting flash floods is especially difficult when storms move slowly and rainfall totals can vary dramatically across short distances.

Staffing shortages and reduced investment in forecasting systems could compound the problem.

After deadly floods struck Valencia last year, outraged residents claimedwarnings came too late.

Local and federal officials in Texas are now facing scrutiny as questions mount over whether quicker or clearer warnings might have saved lives.

Sweeping staffing cuts of up to 40 per cent have affected NWS offices nationwide since Donald Trump took office in January. The service has eliminated or reduced vital weather balloon launches in eight US locations, a move decried by meteorologists and former agency leaders ahead of the start of the severe weather season.

It’s unclear how greatly the cuts affected the New Braunfels branch of the NWS – which covers Austin, San Antonio and nearby areas – but it reportedly had additional personnel on duty during the storms over the weekend.

Will Texas face worse storms in future?

Texas is no stranger to floods, but experts say this week’s events are an urgent reminder that the future is very likely to be wetter, less predictable and more dangerous.

“Nobody saw this coming,” Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly told reporters at a press conference on Saturday.

As climate change continues to reshape weather patterns, the world will likely need major upgrades to handle a world where ‘once-in-a-century’ storms may arrive every decade.

“In a warming climate we know that the atmosphere has more moisture to give, to hold on to and then to release. But also the thing that we know about climate change is that our rain events are not as uniform as what they used to be,” said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist with Climate Central.",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/35/99/41/1200x675_cmsv2_c01e02e0-3f26-5a3c-8601-c22f0b36f050-9359941.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:25:23.634513

Odisha has attracted over ₹5 trillion (~$58 billion) in investments across the manufacturing sector, with 14% of the investment going towards green energy equipment and 8% towards electric vehicles and component manufacturing.

The state has outlined several renewable energy goals in the report.

Renewable Energy Goals

To address the rising clean energy demand, Odisha plans to add 21,000 MW of generation capacity by 2047, with over 70% to 75% of this capacity coming from renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, round-the-clock renewables, and advanced storage solutions.

The state’s current installed renewable energy capacity is 10% of the total installed capacity. Odisha aims to generate 55% of the state’s total energy from renewable sources.

To achieve this goal, the state plans to mobilize between ₹1.8 trillion (~$21 billion) and ₹2 trillion (~$23 billion) through tailored incentives and policies. It will organize energy-themed roadshows focusing on new technologies such as floating solar, small modular reactors for nuclear power, and energy storage.

Odisha aims to establish a ‘State Green Energy Transition Fund’ to provide initial investments for the energy transition. It also plans to establish a task force to expedite the development of 7 GW of pumped storage projects.

The state aims to be among the top five energy-exporting states by 2047, supplying power to southern and eastern India. It targets achieving at least 33% green power consumption in industrial sectors, while maintaining competitive tariffs to attract investment.

The vision document says Odisha will work towards enabling green industries through 3–5 MMTPA green hydrogen production capacity. These industries will include green steel and aluminum production.

The state government said the new investment opportunities will help it generate 75,000 new jobs in renewable energy.

According to the report, Odisha is also planning to achieve a near 80% electric vehicle and alternative fuel vehicles sales penetration in road transport by 2047. The sales penetration is currently at approximately 7%.

The state government said that Odisha’s 11% share of the nation’s water resources underpins a vast 36 GW potential for pumped storage projects, with 1.7 GW already under development.

The state plans to tap into its floating solar energy potential, estimated at between 17 GW and 18 GW, supported by its extensive surface water resources. It targets enabling 50% of end-use electricity consumption in agriculture and urban households to be powered by solar energy by 2036.

Last year, the Odisha Government approved two major projects in the renewable energy sector, with a combined investment of ₹4.11 billion (~$49.1 million).

According to reports from outlets like The Wall Street Journal, the order seeks to address the issue of excessive regulation in the nuclear sector. However, the construction of nuclear reactors in the U.S. has stagnated for years, making it unrealistic to rapidly develop nuclear power to meet the demands of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.

The executive order significantly shortens the approval process for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, primarily for defense and AI-related facilities. It permits the maximum deployment of small modular reactors and advanced nuclear reactors at federal sites, intending to revitalize the U.S. nuclear industry, including the nuclear fuel cycle, and enhance support for new reactor technologies. The goal is to quadruple nuclear energy production in the U.S. over the next 25 years and to have three experimental reactors operational by next Independence Day.

The Wall Street Journal noted that nuclear reactor construction in the U.S. has nearly stalled over the past few decades, with only two reactors in Georgia expected to become commercially operational in 2023 and 2024. Before this, there had been no new reactors in operation since 2016, and efforts to build new plants face challenges such as shortages of raw materials and insufficient funding. Energy analyst Schurman from the Beacon Policy Research Institute stated that the ideal solution for U.S. power supply is to equip large data centers with dedicated small modular reactors, but the U.S. is no longer building nuclear power plants.

The vice president of Uranium Energy emphasized the urgent need for regulatory reform in the nuclear sector. ""The U.S. must maintain regulatory independence and uphold a culture of nuclear safety, but if we continue to operate as we did decades ago, success will be elusive. The approval timeline for reactors should be reduced from 8-10 years to within two years.""

Sprott Asset Management CEO highlighted that the Trump administration is shifting its energy policy focus away from clean energy sources like solar and wind, with some incentives for renewable energy, including nuclear, being cut or eliminated. ""This will lead some public utility companies and energy firms to lose interest in nuclear energy and gradually shift towards fossil fuels.""

Syria’s largest city was mostly pitch-black, the few speckles of light coming from the other households able to afford solar panels, batteries, or private generators.

Al-Jenan went thousands of dollars in debt to buy his solar panel in 2019. It was an expensive coping mechanism at the time, but without it, he couldn’t charge his phone and run the refrigerator.

Syria has not had more than four hours of state electricity per day for years, as a result of the nearly 14-year civil war that ended with the ouster of former President Bashar Assad in December.

Syria’s new leaders are hoping renewable energy will now become more than a patchwork solution. Investment is beginning to return to the country with the lifting of U.S. sanctions, and major energy projects are planned, including an industrial-scale solar farm that would secure about a tenth of the country’s energy needs.

“The solution to the problem isn’t putting solar panels on roofs,” Syria’s interim Energy Minister Mohammad al-Bashir told The Associated Press. “It’s securing enough power for the families through our networks in Syria. This is what we’re trying to do.”

Restoring the existing energy infrastructure

Some of the efforts focus on simply repairing infrastructure destroyed in the war. The World Bank recently announced a $146 million grant to help Syria repair damaged transmission lines and transformer substations. Al-Bashir said Syria’s infrastructure that has been repaired can provide 5,000 megawatts, about half the country’s needs, but fuel and gas shortages have hampered generation. With the sanctions lifted, that supply could come in soon.

More significantly, Syria recently signed a $7 billion energy deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and American companies. The program over the next three and a half years would develop four combined-cycle gas turbines with a total generating capacity estimated at approximately 4,000 megawatts and a 1,000-megawatt solar farm. This would “broadly secure the needs” of Syrians, said Al-Bashir.

While Syria is initially focusing on fixing its existing fossil fuel infrastructure to improve quality of life, help make businesses functional again, and entice investors, the U.N. Development Program said in May that a renewable energy plan will be developed in the next year for the country.

The plan will look at Syria’s projected energy demand and determine how much of it can come from renewable sources.

“Given the critical role of energy in Syria’s recovery, we have to rapidly address energy poverty and progressively accelerate the access to renewable energy,” Sudipto Mukerjee, UNDP’s resident representative in Syria, said in a statement announcing the plan.

Sanctions crippled the power grid

While the war caused significant damage to Syria’s infrastructure, crippling Washington-led sanctions imposed during the Assad dynasty’s decades of draconian rule made it impossible for Syria to secure fuel and spare parts to generate power.

“Many companies over the past period would tell us the sanctions impact matters like imports, implementing projects, transferring funds and so on,” al-Bashir said.

During a visit to Turkey in May, the minister said Syria could only secure about 1700 megawatts, a little less than 20%, of its energy needs.

A series of executive orders by U.S. President Donald Trump lifted many sanctions on Syria, aiming to end the country’s isolation from the global banking system so that it can become viable again and rebuild itself.

The United Nations estimates the civil war caused hundreds of billions of dollars in damages and economic losses across the country. Some 90% of Syrians live in poverty. Buying solar panels, private generators or other means of producing their own energy has been out of reach for most of the population.

“Any kind of economic recovery needs a functional energy sector,” said Joseph Daher, Syrian-Swiss economist and researcher, who said that stop-gap measures like solar panels and private generators were luxuries only available to a few who could afford it. “There is also a need to diminish the cost of electricity in Syria, which is one of the most expensive in the region.”

Prices for electricity in recent years surged as the country under its former rulers struggled with currency inflation and rolling back on subsidies. The new officials who inherited the situation say that lifting sanctions will help them rectify the country’s financial and economic woes, and provide sufficient and affordable electricity as soon as they can.

“The executive order lifts most of the obstacles for political and economic investment with Syria,” said Qutaiba Idlibi, who leads the Americas section of the Foreign Ministry.

Syria has been under Washington-led sanctions for decades, but designations intensified during the war that started in 2011. Even with some waivers for humanitarian programs, it was difficult to bring in resources and materials to fix Syria’s critical infrastructure — especially electricity — further compounding the woes of the vast majority of Syrians, who live in poverty.

The focus is economic recovery

The removal of sanctions signals to U.S. businesses that Trump is serious in his support for Syria’s recovery, Idlibi said.

“Right now, we have a partnership with the United States as any normal country would do,” he said.

Meanwhile, Al-Jenan is able to turn on both his fans on a hot summer day while he watches the afternoon news on TV, as the temperature rises to 35 degrees Celsius (95 F). He doesn’t want to let go of his solar panel but hopes the lifting of sanctions will eventually bring sustainable state electricity across the country.

“We can at least know what’s going on in the country and watch on TV,” he said. “We really were cut off from the entire world.”

The bill, which initially stalled when House leadership encountered resistance from deficit hawks over approving procedural rules, was signed into law by the President on 4 July 2025. The bill includes major changes to clean energy tax credits and vehicle efficiency and emissions standards, which are outlined as follows.

Clean Fuels

Notably, the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Credit, which was set to expire in 2031 per earlier versions of the bill, is now set to end after 31 December 2029. The final bill also applies a restriction on foreign feedstocks. This could limit the growth of clean fuels such as renewable diesel, specifically for coastal facilities that rely on imported feedstocks to produce cleaner fuels. The bill also reduces the amount of crediting eligible for Sustainable Aviation Fuel but confirms that manure-based biogas remains eligible for the credit.

Carbon Sequestration and Enhanced Oil Recovery

The 45Q Tax Credit for Carbon Sequestration was left intact, with the tax credit for enhanced oil recovery being expanded to be on par with the credits received for geologic storage. This could encourage carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) activities being carried out at oil and refining facilities.

Zero-Emission Vehicle and Efficiency Standards

Additional Updates

The bill also modifies the 45V Clean Hydrogen Credit by making facilities that begin construction after 31 December 2028 no longer eligible. While this is seen as an extension given previous iterations suggested making this date 31 December 2025, this is still a lower window compared to the original 2033 date in the Inflation Reduction Act. While this may still benefit clean hydrogen projects, the limited time frame may hinder the commercial adoption of certain projects. The bill also keeps battery and solar tax credit eligibility through 2032 but ends crediting for wind projects in 2027 and phases out mineral credits by 2033. Finally, the bill doubles the biodiesel producer credit and extends it through 2026, strengthening margins for smaller Midwest and Northwest producers serving clean fuel markets.

Impact on Carbon Markets

The dismantling of foundational policy tools that pushed automakers toward fleet-wide electrification and rollbacks of incentives for clean fuel production risk stalling climate progress across the country, moving further away from the 1.5-degree warming target. While some revisions may in fact support near-term growth in clean fuels, the broader structural shifts that this bill introduces jeopardize overall decarbonization. Reduced federal incentives that supported achieving targets and emission reduction goals under Low-Carbon-Fuel Standards and Cap-and-Invest programs may slow the rate of emissions decline, adding bullish pressure to the programs.

This regulatory rollback may force states like California to reassess targets with respect to fuels’ carbon intensity, ZEV adoption, and overall emission forecasts in carbon markets.

The nascent movement has quickly divided the party while also catching on in real time: It’s credited with pushing California Gov. Gavin Newsom to ditch a key environmental regulation and sidestep the demands of labor unions in order to pass a budget package that expedites housing development in the state.

“This isn’t just a budget. This is a budget that builds. It proves what’s possible when we govern with urgency, with clarity, and with a belief in abundance over scarcity,” Mr. Newsom said at the June 30 bill signing that gave a high-profile nod to the new movement.

A top 2028 Democratic presidential contender, Mr. Newsom has enthusiastically adopted the abundance agenda, which, he said, aims for “a more responsive and results-driven government.”

Democratic lawmakers and party thought leaders outside California are embracing the movement as a pathway to rebuilding support following their disastrous November election results.

“Abundance is the potential framework for the reinvention of the Democratic Party,” House Rep. George Whitesides said at a Democratic retreat in April hosted by the Progressive Policy Institute.

Growing enthusiasm for the movement followed the March release of a best-selling book, “Abundance,” by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, which declares many of the rules and regulations of the 1970s are a hindrance to the liberal goals of today’s “urban density” and green energy projects.

“Progress requires facing up to the institutions in life that are not working as they need to. It means, for liberals, recognizing when the government is failing. It means, for conservatives, recognizing when the government is needed,” they write.

Democrat Zellnor Myrie ran on the abundance platform in New York City’s Democratic primary in June and picked up about 1% of the vote.

But the movement got a shout-out from primary winner Zohran Mamdani, who has skyrocketed to the top of the party — and national politics — by capturing the left-wing vote with his ultra-liberal plans to significantly expand housing and free transit.

“I find a lot of the discussion around abundance to be quite compelling,” Mr. Mamdani said during an interview on the “FYPod” podcast. “There are a lot of regulations, rules and even fines that we do not have a huge justification for any longer.”

On Capitol Hill, Democrats are adopting the principles of the abundance movement through a new, bipartisan caucus advocating for pro-growth policies. It aims to increase American energy production, make housing more affordable and speed up infrastructure projects by cutting red tape and incentivizing development.

“One of the cruelest ironies in America is that we have more laws restricting the supply of affordable housing than expanding it,” said Rep. Ritchie Torres, New York Democrat. “That’s neither progressive nor pro–working class. It’s time for every elected official to embrace an agenda of abundance — an abundance of opportunity for all Americans.”

The rise of the abundance platform has angered many on the left who say the movement runs counter to the party’s liberal-leaning populist agenda, led by the likes of Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Their message has attracted droves of young voters in part by blaming not the government, but the “oligarchy” of billionaires and big corporations for the problems facing working-class Americans.

“We won’t beat Trump’s rightwing populism with more of the same sucking-up to corporate donors that voters have become disgusted with. If anything, that strategy threatens to further cut Democrats off from their former working-class base,” Aaron Regunberg, a Democratic organizer who served in the Rhode Island Legislature, told The Washington Times.

A Demand Progress poll taken in May found about a third of Democrats would be more likely to support a candidate running for Congress or the White House on the abundance agenda, compared to nearly 73% who said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate running on a populist agenda.

The poll defined a populist candidate as someone who believes big corporations have too much power over the economy and need to be reined in. The abundance agenda was described as one that would push back against “organized interest groups and community groups,” who slow down housing, energy and road projects by exploiting regulations.

In California, regulations got the ax as well as the organizations exploiting them under the umbrella of the abundance movement.

Housing, transit, wildfire mitigation and infrastructure projects in California have for years been hobbled by the landmark California Environmental Quality Act. The 1970 law signed by Gov. Ronald Reagan stalled projects by opening them up to endless lawsuits from environmental groups and organizations opposed to the developments.

Mr. Newsom’s two-bill legislative package takes a hammer to some of those rules and regulations. It weakens CEQA by streamlining approval for housing and infrastructure projects, and it exempts a large swath of urban residential development from CEQA entirely.

The legislative package freezes new residential building standards for the next six years and speeds up housing permitting and approvals.

The governor also bypassed demands from labor unions who sought wage increases and other new benefits for workers, which would have hiked building costs and slowed the development of new housing.

Mr. Newsom and those who support the legislation said the reduced regulatory burden will jumpstart construction and begin to fill the state’s shortage of an estimated 4 million housing units.

The governor, echoing the movement’s mantra, said, “We’re urgently embracing an abundance agenda by tearing down the barriers that have delayed new affordable housing and infrastructure for decades.”

Mr. Newsom’s actions rankled environmentalists who typically mount their opposition against Republicans.

Sierra Club California Senior Policy Strategist Jakob Evans complained the legislation was written without transparency, “and will have destructive consequences for environmental justice communities and endangered species across California.”

Steve M. Boyle, executive director of the YIMBYDems, a group advocating for the abundance agenda, said the abundance platform will pave the way for more green energy projects by removing the regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles blocking their development.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/12/Immigration_Governors_16360_c0-0-3869-2256_s1200x700.jpg?c5bc52a98e2e022609802e13984220a21594767d,N,,2025-07-07 12:27:12.029202

In early June, they agreed to collaborate on carbon-capture projects and trade low-carbon electricity. This commitment to renewable energy aligns with an earlier agreement, in which Indonesia agreed to export solar panels to Singapore.

This most recent deal lays the groundwork for a long-term collaboration on future renewable energy projects. At the time of writing, the nations are planning to develop sustainable industrial sites.

Bahlil Lahadalia, Indonesia's energy minister, announced that he expects the deal to rake in over $10 billion in investments from solar panel manufacturing, per Reuters.

Renewable energy — energy from sources such as solar, wind, and bioenergy — is outpacing older systems in critical markets. It provided a record-high 32% of the world's power last year, and it's only getting bigger. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the global market for renewable energy is projected to be worth $23 trillion within the next five years.

This has led to exponential job growth across the world. A report from the International Labour Organization stated that about 2 million renewable energy jobs were created from 2022 to 2023 alone.

The switch to renewable energy also benefits the planet. Unlike fossil fuels, which pollute the atmosphere and harm people's health, renewable energy sources produce no pollution (and can even reduce it in some cases).

While the road ahead may be long, countries such as Singapore and Indonesia are setting an important precedent. In a press release, Dr. Tan See Lang, a leader in the Energy, Science, and Technology faction of Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry, said: ""These win-win partnerships will support both countries in achieving a resilient and lowcarbon energy future, and generate new investments into green activities, while we do our part for global climate action.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Indonesia-Singapore-dealimage-reczz33tFUwla0ah2-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 10:06:38.346344

While their battery production does have environmental costs, EVs still beat gas-powered cars over their full lifetime.
Installing solar panels on any electric vehicle not only saves you money, but it can also be more reliable than the grid.","What once sounded like pure science fiction is about to be reality. Israeli aerospace startup AIR has partnered with the German engineering EDAG Group to build the aluminum structure for its flying vehicle — the AIR One eVTOL, which stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing.

New Atlas reported that the AIR One is a lightweight two-seater aircraft built for short-distance trips. With a targeted top speed of 155 mph and a projected 110-mile range, it's designed for private air travel; no runway needed. It has eight electric rotors and a smart battery system with built-in redundancy, meaning if multiple systems fail, it can still land safely.

AIR has already been working on this project for several years, and it recently became the first eVTOL to conduct an uncrewed cargo operation at night.

""With EDAG's expertise in vehicle development, design and production, we are taking a critical step toward bringing advanced air mobility to the masses,"" AIR CEO and co-founder Rani Plaut said, per New Atlas. ""This partnership paves the way for streamlined, scalable production of AIR One, enabling faster delivery to meet the growing demand from consumers and enterprises for accessible air transportation.""

According to New Atlas, AIR says the new structure from EDAG features folding wings for easier storage and transport, and the interior has been upgraded to be roomier. It's a key step toward mass production — and potentially mainstream adoption. In fact, AIR has already taken 2,000 preorders for the vehicle and is hoping to start delivering to customers by late 2025.

Unlike gas-powered vehicles, electric vehicles like the AIR One are quieter, cleaner, and lower maintenance. While their battery production does have environmental costs, EVs still beat gas-powered cars over their full lifetime. One study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that battery EVs emit about 200 grams of carbon pollution per mile driven on an average U.S. power grid, compared to 350 grams for traditional vehicles.

And because these machines are electric, they are more affordable than gas vehicles, especially when charged with home solar. Installing solar panels on any electric vehicle not only saves you money, but it can also be more reliable than the grid.

The US experienced a record-breaking $128.2 billion in total weather-related damages in 2024 alone, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. That toll has triggered a fundamental shift in the luxury real estate landscape, particularly in regions most vulnerable to wildfires, flooding, hurricanes, and extreme heat.

In Los Angeles, the effects are being felt in some of the city’s most prestigious zip codes. Neighborhoods such as Pacific Palisades and Altadena, long viewed as bastions of wealth and stability, are now grappling with increased wildfire threats. A recent report from the UCLA Anderson School of Management estimated $76 billion to $131 billion in property damage and capital losses in the area, with $45 billion in insured losses.

In response, homeowners and developers are pivoting toward climate-conscious design, embracing fire-resistant materials, resilient landscaping, and advanced smart-home systems aimed at protecting against extreme weather.

This trend isn’t confined to California. A 2024 Realtor.com report found that nearly 45% of all US homes, worth an estimated $22 trillion, are at risk of severe damage from environmental hazards such as wildfires, floods, and heatwaves.

Collapsed deals

Mortgage professionals are seeing the impact firsthand, especially in areas where insurance markets have become unstable. In Colorado, for example, wildfires are no longer a seasonal concern – they’re a persistent threat, wiping out entire neighborhoods, and increasing insurance premiums dramatically.

“It’s a struggle, quite frankly,” said Justin Smith, senior mortgage banker at Cornerstone Home Lending. “There is no single silver bullet here.”

According to the Colorado Division of Insurance, some homeowners in mountain communities near Boulder, Colorado Springs, and Fort Collins have seen premium increases of up to 51% in the past year. In certain cases, insurers have stopped writing new policies altogether in fire-prone regions, leaving homeowners scrambling for coverage or turning to the state’s FAIR Plan—a limited last-resort option.

“That home represents our collateral for the loan,” Smith told Mortgage Professional America in a May interview. “We’ve got to have that thing insured.”

Without adequate insurance, lenders can’t approve financing, and deals collapse. In recent months, real estate agents in high-risk regions are now seeing deals fall apart simply because buyers cannot secure insurance.

Removing EV credits and rolling back fuel-efficiency standards derail automakers’ investments in battery and hybrid factories, a professor contends.","The Trump Admin. got its sweeping budget bill through both houses of Congress, and the impact on the auto industry will be felt for years to come.

While measures in the One Big Beautiful Bill like Medicaid cuts won’t kick in until 2027, the $7,500 federal electric-vehicle tax incentive will expire on Sept. 30 – ditching new and used battery-electric and hybrid-vehicle credits – possibly making BEVs more expensive for consumers and slowing EV adoption.

Critics of the White House’s war on clean energy investments argue this not only will result in stranding EV investments made by automakers, but it also undermines the auto industry’s competitiveness compared with China and Europe.

“By dismantling these critical incentives, the Senate has taken a sledgehammer to the U.S. EV industry at a time when global competition – particularly from China – is intensifying. … Their removal threatens to stall this momentum and cede leadership in transportation electrification to foreign adversaries,” says Ben Prochazka, executive director-Electrification Coalition.

While the budget bill taketh away, it also giveth something back to the auto industry, including dealers, by way of a new car-loan interest deduction. The bill allows new-car buyers to write off auto loan interest on U.S.-assembled vehicles (MY 2025–2028). The deduction will be limited to $10,000 per year and eliminated for individuals earning more than $100,000 or couples making over $200,000. The deduction will apply to cars purchased after Dec. 31, 2024. Car buyers won’t have to itemize to claim the deduction.

The bill also extends the Trump Admin.’s 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts – targeting imports from Canada, Mexico and China – after temporary United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)-linked exemptions expire. Andersen Consulting estimates these codified tariffs could raise costs of new vehicles by $3,000–$6,000 on average, or up to $10,000–$15,000 for some luxury models. Whatever costs are not passed on to consumers will be absorbed against automakers’ earnings. Analysts at Third Bridge and Cox Automotive foresee average new-car price hikes of $5,000 to $6,000 –leading to a 16% jump in retail prices as a result of tariffs.

President Donald Trump has been pushing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for a cut in interest rates, which would benefit auto sales as well as home buying, but the Trump appointee says the tariffs have stood in the way. Powell agreed with the statement the Fed would have cut interest rates by now if it weren’t for Trump’s tariffs during a July 1 panel at a banking forum in Portugal..

TD Economics estimates U.S. auto sales could drop 10%-20% the rest of this year and into 2026, with ripple effects on the neighboring economies of Canada and Mexico. J.D Power’s forecast for the second half of 2025 anticipates a slowdown in U.S. auto sales, following a stronger first half as many as new-vehicle sales were pulled ahead to avoid tariffs and the cancellation of the EV tax credit.

J.D. Power forecasts that 2025 new-vehicle sales will total approximately 15.3 million units, reflecting a modest increase over 2024 but indicating a shift toward a more cautious market in the latter half of the year.

EV sales are expected to surge until the end of September. Ingrid Malmgren of Plug In America expects a surge in EV sales. “This is going to be the summer of the EV, because come the end of September those credits will be gone,” the organization’s senior policy director says in a statement.

A coalition of industry groups, including the Alliance for Automotive Innovation and the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Assn., warn that the Trump Admin.’s sweeping tariffs could trigger production halts if even a single supplier fails – impacting 10 million U.S. auto-related jobs and $1.2 trillion in economic output.

Trade Stalemates

The Trump Admin. has not been able to cut new trade deals with countries it is tariffing; President Trump said last week the White House is now just sending letters to trade representatives informing them of tariffs. Japan, Germany and South Korea, three major auto exporters to the U.S., have said the default 25% tariffs on their countries are not tenable. South Korea and Japan have no tariffs on foreign-made automobiles and parts. Germany has a 10% tariff on imported passenger cars but has indicated it would cancel it. President Trump, however, also wants Germany and the European Union to import more liquified natural gas and arms from U.S. defense companies; it’s unclear what he wants from Japan and South Korea.

In a statement following Senate passage of the broader reconciliation bill, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation voiced support for several measures the bill, especially the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, which modifies the existing clean-energy–focused credit established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) by contouring the credits through 2029 then phasing them down after that.

Alliance CEO John Bozzella praises the measure for working to bring battery manufacturing back to the U.S. and excluding Chinese companies, preserving “billions in auto-related manufacturing investments and jobs.”

The Alliance also says, though, that phase-out of the EV tax credits will be extremely challenging to EV adoption and hurt consumer affordability.

Removing EV credits and rolling back fuel-efficiency standards derail automakers’ investments in battery and hybrid factories, a professor contends. “Gutting the incentives of the IRA will likely mean a number of projects are abandoned… While the rest of the world moves on to clean energy and looks to China for inputs, the U.S. will be left behind,” says Joshua Busby, public affairs professor and an energy policy expert at the University of Texas at Austin.

Long-term Economic Repercussions

Economists fear a recession if consumer spending declines due to the combination of tariff-induced inflation and reduced auto affordability.

“The boost to the national debt from President Trump’s sweeping tax bill could add fresh fuel to inflation just as his tariff policies are already pushing prices up… detractors fear it will drive up interest rates and borrowing costs, potentially leading the economy toward stagflation or recession,” says former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, President Trump vowed new 10% tariffs on countries that seek alignment with the “Anti-American policies of BRICS,” referring to Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, presently meeting at a summit in Brazil. The group had, prior to his comment, issued a joint statement Sunday criticizing rising tariffs as “unjustified unilateral protectionist measures.”

China is the world’s leading new-vehicle market, with 31 million new vehicles sold last year. China also is dominant in EVs, with about 40% of the 31 million 2024 sales comprising BEVs, hybrids, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell models. A strong export business has led to increasing numbers of Chinese vehicles being sold in Brazil, India and Russia, impacting legacy automakers’ market share in those countries.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt7121b6ec5c11097b/blt4667c8e9381f4ce0/686b3a9898590c64f03c50cc/SClass.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-07 10:06:15.512106

What will the successful implementation of fusion energy mean for the world’s energy landscape?","The advancement of nuclear fusion energy took a significant leap forward as China shipped 48 vital blanket shield block modules to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France. This marks a pivotal moment in the quest for sustainable energy, showcasing international collaboration in the world’s largest experimental tokamak fusion project. Known as the “artificial sun,” ITER is a beacon of hope for clean energy, uniting the efforts of countries like China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and the United States. As these modules embark on their journey from Guangzhou, China, they symbolize a crucial step toward realizing fusion as a large-scale, environmentally friendly power source.

Magnetic Cage Technology Powers ITER’s Nuclear Fusion Efforts

The heart of the ITER project lies in its groundbreaking magnetic cage technology, which is fundamental to confining and controlling super-heated plasma for fusion reactions. This gigantic structure, weighing approximately 5,500 tons, is composed of nine sectors and features 44 ports. These ports play a crucial role in facilitating essential operations such as diagnostics, remote handling, heating, and fueling. With an interior volume of about 49,000 cubic feet, the tokamak acts as a specialized platform for advancing fusion research.

Luo Delong, the deputy director general of the ITER organization, emphasizes the project’s goal of developing nuclear fusion energy as a sustainable solution for future energy needs. Fusion energy’s appeal lies in its virtually limitless fuel supply, minimal environmental impact, and high safety standards. The blanket shield block modules, essential for the reactor’s stability, offer neutron shielding and manage heat conduction in extreme thermal conditions, protecting the reactor and its operators.

China and South Korea Lead ITER Module Production

In the ambitious ITER project, China and South Korea are leading the charge in module production. These blanket shield block modules are designed to perform two critical functions: shielding against high-energy neutrons and transferring significant amounts of nuclear heat using cooling water. This dual role not only protects peripheral equipment but also ensures that components operate within safe temperature limits.

China, through Dongfang Electric Corporation, is responsible for producing 220 modules, with the first 48 already shipped. According to Wang Weidong, chairman of Dongfang Electric (Guangzhou) Heavy Machinery Co., Ltd., the remaining modules are slated for delivery by 2027. South Korea has taken on the production of four ITER vacuum vessel sectors, having increased its initial responsibility from two sectors in 2016. This collaboration highlights the global effort to push the boundaries of fusion energy technology.

Tritium: The Future of Fusion Fuel

The blanket shield block modules are poised to play a pivotal role in producing tritium, a crucial fuel for sustaining nuclear fusion reactions. Tritium is essential but scarce, posing a challenge for large-scale fusion energy development. Currently, the ITER project does not focus on tritium production, but there are plans to explore its potential in future phases of the project.

Chen Jiming, chief scientist at the Southwestern Institute of Physics, underscores the importance of tritium in achieving sustainable fusion. The team’s future work aims to enable tritium regeneration, potentially boosting the sustainability of clean energy. This exploration could pave the way for more efficient and continuous fusion reactions, enhancing the practicality of fusion as a global energy solution.

The Global Impact of ITER’s Progress

ITER’s progress signifies a monumental shift in the pursuit of clean energy. By harnessing the power of nuclear fusion, the project aims to replicate the energy production process of the sun on Earth, offering an almost limitless supply of clean energy. The collaborative efforts of nations involved in ITER underscore the potential of fusion to transform global energy systems.

As countries like China and South Korea lead module production and contribute critical components, the international community inches closer to realizing fusion’s promise. The advancements made in ITER not only offer hope for a sustainable future but also challenge us to consider the possibilities that fusion energy holds. What will the successful implementation of fusion energy mean for the world’s energy landscape?

The backtracking reflects a pervasive sense that once-popular climate policies are exacting a political price by pushing up energy and housing costs, draining support from both Democratic candidates and climate policies themselves.
To some GOP leaders in California, Democrats’ recent backtracking validates years of Republican warnings about cost-inflating climate policies.
”Of course Democrats are on the defensive and scrambling on climate policies — they’re losing,” Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones said in a statement.
“It’s one of the more disappointing turnabouts,” said Consumer Watchdog President Jamie Court, whose group has advocated tougher oil industry rules.","“California was the vocal climate leader during the first Trump administration,” said Chris Chavez, deputy policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air. “It’s questionable whether or not that leadership is still there.”

California leaders are still positioning themselves as the vanguard of the resistance to the president’s environmental rollbacks, and polls still consistently find voters believe addressing climate change is worth the cost. Gov. Gavin Newsom has sued to block Trump’s removal of California’s permission to enforce its clean car standards and vowed to extend a landmark cap-and-trade program imperiled by Trump.

But they’re in a far different position than during Trump’s first term, when they were signing deals with automakers to keep the state’s emissions rules afloat — and even two years ago, when they were taking on oil companies by threatening to cap their profits. It’s a reversal that is dismaying to climate activists, an outspoken part of the Democratic Party’s base. And it’s a trade-off — freighted with significant and potentially long-lasting policy implications — that party leaders are making in an effort to regain political strength.

“We’ve got some challenges, and so it just requires some new considerations,” Newsom told reporters last week, after his administration proposed steering clear of the oil-profits cap as a way to keep refineries open. “It’s not rolling back anything — that’s actually marching forward in a way that is thoughtful and considered.”

Other parts of the country are pulling back on climate policies in the name of affordability, too. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is delaying plans for a carbon-trading system and slowing enforcement of the state’s rules for clean cars and trucks, which follow California’s. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore is similarly pausing on carbon trading. And in Congress, some 36 Democrats — including two from California — signed on to the effort to overturn California’s vehicle rules.

But California, as the state with the strongest suite of climate policies and a decadeslong reputation of stalwart environmentalism, is now becoming an unlikely leader in Democrats’ pivot as they try to respond to cost-of-living concerns that they fret may have cost them the election.

“This is part of the Democrats’ doing some soul-searching and really trying to figure out what they stand for,” said Marie Liu, a climate-focused lobbyist and a former top environmental adviser to legislative Democrats.

Housing reviews, fuel standards, plastic rules targeted

Newsom and other Democrats last week infuriated environmentalists by punching exemptions for housing developments and other projects like health clinics and high-speed rail into a decades-old law requiring a wide range of projects to clear environmental reviews.

A separate push in the state Senate to dilute the state’s stringent fuel rules drew a rebuke from the head of California’s powerful Air Resources Board, who called it “irresponsible” in the face of a federal onslaught.

And Newsom in March ordered his recycling regulator to rewrite plastic waste reduction rules to lessen costs for businesses, which upset the state lawmakers and environmental groups who originally negotiated the waste reduction deal but energized business groups opposing similar rules in New York.

The backtracking reflects a pervasive sense that once-popular climate policies are exacting a political price by pushing up energy and housing costs, draining support from both Democratic candidates and climate policies themselves.

“For a lot of Democrats, the 2024 election was a reality check about the importance of cost-of-living issues and affordability for Californians,” said Mark Baldassare, survey director at the Public Policy Institute of California. “That’s given policymakers some pause about what is actually workable in terms of environmental policy.”

From Sacramento to Washington

Newsom and allies are retrenching in Sacramento as Republicans in Washington take aim at core California climate planks, like its longstanding ability to set tougher pollution limits.

Yet even on Capitol Hill, Democrats who typically decry Trump’s agenda have sided with Republicans who call California’s policies unsustainable. Rep. Lou Correa, who has said the 2024 election showed Democrats must heed cost-strained voters, and Rep. George Whitesides, who flipped a commuter-heavy Los Angeles district last cycle, voted to block Newsom’s order phasing out the sale of new entirely gas-powered vehicles by 2035.

Climate change has dominated Sacramento’s agenda in recent years. Newsom spent substantial political capital in 2022 to muscle through a sweeping set of environmental laws, reviving efforts that had formerly succumbed to resistance from the oil industry and its union allies. Newsom followed up by pushing to cap industry profits.

Not in 2025. “Affordability” has become the watchword for Democrats who saw inflation woes drive votes to Republicans across the 2024 ballot. In a poll presented to Assembly Democrats during a caucus meeting, cost of living led voters’ stated priorities. Climate change sat in last place.

Yet Liu warned Democrats were learning the wrong lesson by focusing narrowly on immediate concerns like gas prices at the expense of a larger effort to shift from fossil fuels.

“It’s easy to focus on the very short-term responses but not take the longer-term view,” Liu said, which would require “not just playing around on ten cents a gallon, but looking at the actual transition to cleaner alternatives.”

Oil industry pressure

In-state oil producers have maintained political pressure on Democrats, spending more than $15 million over the last two years on a sustained campaign of mailers and advertisements blaming the state’s climate policies for high prices. Signs at gas stations urge voters to put pressure on their elected officials.

Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said she was heartened by regulators’ recent recommendations to pause a refinery profit margin cap and streamline permitting for in-state crude oil production.

“I had no idea that it would sort of come to fruition this year, but I am encouraged by it,” she said.

Republicans have pummeled Newsom and Democrats over the state gas tax’s annual increase and a tightening of the state’s fuel standards. To some GOP leaders in California, Democrats’ recent backtracking validates years of Republican warnings about cost-inflating climate policies.

”Of course Democrats are on the defensive and scrambling on climate policies — they’re losing,” Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones said in a statement. “Californians love the environment and rightly expect clean air, clean water, and clean streets. What they don’t love are out-of-touch policies that destroy livelihoods in the name of climate change.”

State laws explicitly direct California to move away from fossil fuels, which would mean putting the state’s historically large and politically powerful oil industry out of business.

Yet the threat of plummeting production — with two refineries announcing their plans to close within the past year — has rattled elected officials, who fear plunging capacity could lead to a price spike. The California Energy Commission’s plan to keep refineries operating specifically seeks to avoid that scenario.

“We always knew this was going to be a really tough time, where we’ve made enough progress that refineries have to make tough business decisions but you still have a majority of Californians relying on gasoline,” said Daniel Barad, western states policy senior manager for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “You have to do things in this mid-transition point that’s going to make your stomach hurt a bit but is going to stabilize gas prices in the near term.”

Cap-and-trade clash

The shifting dynamics are spilling into the debate over the state’s landmark cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas emissions, which both state lawmakers and Newsom have endorsed extending beyond its 2030 expiration date. But Newsom upset environmentalists — and cheered business groups — by declining to endorse fixes to the program aimed at further reducing emissions.

The politics have moved markedly since California reauthorized the program in 2017. At the time, then-Republican Assembly leader Chad Mayes persuaded a handful of fellow Republicans to vote for it, arguing it was a more market-friendly option. He lost his job as a result.

Mayes said progressive Democrats explicitly told him at the time that they wanted a more aggressive set of rules in part because they would push up oil prices, hastening a shift to alternative energy. Now, he said, Democrats are responding to the “very clear signal voters are sending to their elected officials” that “it’s just too much right now.”

“If you’re going to talk about affordability then you have to be honest about the policies you’ve put in place and what those costs are,” said Mayes, who left the Republican Party in 2019 and now oversees climate policy for a lobbying firm whose clients include renewable energy companies. “It’s appropriate for people to take a second look and say: ‘How expensive are we going to allow our energy costs to be?’”

But to many climate activists, that kind of calculation reads more like a surrender.

“It’s one of the more disappointing turnabouts,” said Consumer Watchdog President Jamie Court, whose group has advocated tougher oil industry rules. “We have backed down, and we may not be flying a white handkerchief, but it’s pretty close to white.”

Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government.

The small Alaskan tribal village sits on permafrost, which is thawing fast as global temperatures rise. That’s left the banks of the Kugkaktlik River unstable — and more likely to collapse when floods hit, as they often do. Buildings, boardwalks, wind turbines and other critical infrastructure are at risk, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director.

So when the village learned late last year that it had been awarded a $20 million federal grant to protect the riverbank, tribal members breathed a sigh of relief.

But that relief was short-lived. On May 2, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency canceled the grant. Without that help, Paul says, residents may be forced to relocate their village.

“In the future, so much land will be in the river,” Paul says.

Kipnuk’s grant was one of more than 600 that the EPA has canceled since President Donald Trump took office, according to data obtained by Floodlight through a Freedom of Information Act request. Through May 15, the cuts totaled more than $2.7 billion.

Floodlight’s analysis of the data shows:

Environmental justice grants took by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4 billion in funding wiped out.

The EPA has also canceled more than $120 million in grants aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of cement, concrete and other construction materials. Floodlight reported in April that the cement industry’s carbon emissions rival those of some major countries — and that efforts to decarbonize the industry have lost momentum under the Trump administration.

Blue states bore the brunt. Those states lost nearly $1.6 billion in grant money — or about 57% of the funding cuts.

The single largest grant canceled: A $95 million award to the Research Triangle Institute, a North Carolina-based scientific research organization that had planned to distribute the money to underserved communities. RTI also lost five other EPA grants, totaling more than $36 million.

More cuts could be coming. The Washington Post reported in late April on a court filing that showed the EPA had targeted 781 grants issued under Biden. The data obtained by Floodlight shows the majority of those grants have already been canceled.

Lawsuit challenges grant cancellations

In June, a coalition of nonprofits, tribes and local governments sued the EPA, alleging the Trump administration broke the law by canceling environmental and climate justice grants that Congress had already funded.

“Terminating these grant programs caused widespread harm and disruption to on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build community capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the nonprofits that filed the lawsuit. “We won’t let this stand.”

The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a written response to Floodlight, the agency said this about the grant cancellations:

“The Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission. The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in 2022 when it enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill. The program was designed to help the disadvantaged communities that are often hit hardest by pollution and climate change.

But on Jan. 20, Trump’s first day back in office, he signed an executive order halting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice, and canceling a Biden-era executive order that prioritized tackling environmental racism. Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government.

Underserved communities are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts such as heat waves and flooding because they have fewer resources to prepare or recover, according to a 2021 analysis by the EPA.

Inside the agency, not everyone agrees with the new direction. In a “declaration of dissent,” more than 200 current and former EPA employees spoke out against Trump administration policies, including the decision to dismantle the agency’s environmental justice program.

“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.

On Thursday, the EPA put 139 of the employees who signed the petition on administrative leave, Inside Climate News reported.

From hope to heartbreak in Texas

The people at Downwinders at Risk, a small Texas nonprofit that helps communities harmed by air pollution, thought they were finally getting a break.

Last year, they learned that the EPA had awarded them a $500,000 grant — enough to install nine new air quality monitors in working-class neighborhoods near asphalt shingle plants, a gas well and a fracking operation in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The data would have helped residents avoid the worst air and plan their days around pollution spikes.

But on May 1, the group’s three employees received the news they’d been dreading: Their grant had been canceled.

“It was a very bitter pill to swallow,” said Caleb Roberts, the group’s executive director.

He and his team had devoted more than 100 hours to the application and compliance process.

The nonprofit’s annual budget is just over $250,000, and the federal funding would have allowed the group to expand its reach after years of scraping by. They’d even paused fundraising for six months, confident the federal money was on the way.

“We feel like we’re at ground zero again,” Roberts said. “And that’s just very unfortunate.”

We are delighted to have the opportunity to invest in Peak Cluster alongside the National Wealth Fund.
It is further recognition of the vital role of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) in decarbonising and futureproofing our critical industries.","National Wealth Fund-backed Peak Cluster project could secure around 3,500 jobs, boosting growth in our industrial heartlands as the government’s Plan for Change puts more money in people’s pockets.

Multi-million-pound deal will help decarbonise Britain’s cement and lime industry, securing its future role in rebuilding Britain as part of the Government’s Industrial Strategy and delivering on the Plan for Change.

Plan for Change in action - boosting economic growth that puts more money in people’s pockets – with the investment supporting British industry to decarbonise and expand, helping to rebuild the country and supporting Britain’s transition to a clean energy superpower.

This funding for the flagship Peak Cluster project is the first step towards the development of a leading carbon capture pipeline between cement and lime companies in the Peak District which will store emissions deep below the Irish Sea – accelerating Britain’s transformation into a clean energy superpower.

The Peak Cluster project is the world’s largest cement decarbonisation project - preventing over 3 million tonnes of CO2 entering the atmosphere every year and providing a secure domestic supply of cement and lime products the British construction and manufacturing sectors rely on.

Backed by £31 million from private partners including Holcim, Tarmac, Breedon, SigmaRoc, Summit Energy Evolution and Progressive Energy together with the Morecambe Net Zero project could create and secure 13,000 jobs in the Midlands and North West.

This investment is the Government’s Plan for Change in action - boosting economic growth that puts more money in people’s pockets. Not only could it secure and create thousands of new jobs, but it also supports British industry to decarbonise and expand, helping to rebuild the country and supporting Britain’s transition to a clean energy superpower.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:

The National Wealth Fund is a force for growth, investing £3 billion into the British economy and securing 12,500 jobs.

We’re modernising the cement and lime industry, delivering vital carbon capture infrastructure and creating jobs across Derbyshire, Staffordshire and the North West to put more money into working people’s pockets.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

This landmark investment will catalyse our carbon capture sector to deliver thousands of highly skilled jobs and growth across our industrial heartlands, as part of our Plan for Change.

Workers in the North Sea and Britain’s manufacturing heartlands will drive forward the country’s industrial renewal, positioning them at the forefront of the UK’s clean energy transition.

This will be the National Wealth Fund’s first investment in carbon capture since the Chancellor highlighted it as a priority in her new strategic direction for the Government’s principal investor back in March.

Cement and lime are two of the hardest industrial sectors to decarbonise due to the high levels of CO2 emissions generated in the manufacturing process which cannot be reduced through transitioning to low carbon fuels.

By investing alongside industry, supporting early development risk reduction and providing the critical financing for Peak Cluster through its development process, the National Wealth Fund will remove some of the barriers for private investment to further develop and construct the project.

Through its support for Peak Cluster, it is also building the market and stimulating large scale future investments as the project progresses, and facilitating Spirit Energy’s development of the UK’s largest CO2 store for which a carbon capture pipeline is essential.

The National Wealth Fund will commit at least £5.8 billion by 2030 in hydrogen, carbon capture, ports and supply chains, gigafactories and EV supply chains, and steel. This will help industries decarbonise and to accelerate Britain’s transformation into a clean energy superpower.

John Flint, CEO of the National Wealth Fund, said:

Substantial private investment, deployed at risk, will be needed to develop and deliver carbon capture projects across the UK. Through its investments, the NWF is well placed to support this. Capital must be committed now, especially in hard to abate sectors such as cement and lime, to ensure a pipeline of projects is ready for deployment and the UK is able to meet its ambitious carbon capture targets.

The NWF has played a key role in structuring the transaction to crowd in private sector co-investment while taking early development risk to catalyse future investment. Our involvement demonstrates how we can use our risk capital to solve problems and manage investment uncertainty, amplifying government policy and ultimately removing the barriers for private investors to support this project post-FID.

John Egan, CEO of Peak Cluster Ltd, said:

Peak Cluster is focused on securing a sustainable future for the cement and lime industry. Together with MNZ, the UK’s biggest carbon store, we will capture, transport and store CO₂ to support industry to thrive in a low carbon future.

Through the National Wealth Fund, Government will support the development of essential infrastructure to secure good jobs with good wages, produce sought-after low carbon products here in Britain, grow the UK’s supply chain and skills base, secure private investment and lead the global low carbon technology sector. Peak Cluster, in partnership with MNZ, ticks every one of these boxes.

We will work closely with Government to ensure that Peak Cluster and MNZ together can help secure the future of this foundation industry, creating a backbone of industrial opportunity that benefits communities across the Midlands and North West of England – for the UK and beyond.

Further information

The £59.6 million equity investment in Peak Cluster is made up of:

£28.6 million from the National Wealth Fund

£31 million through a joint venture vehicle between Summit Energy Evolution Ltd (part of Sumitomo Corporation) and Progressive Energy Peak Ltd, as well as each of the Peak Cluster cement and lime producers (Tarmac, Breedon, Holcim, and SigmaRoc)

Together, Peak Cluster and Morecambe Net Zero could create and secure 13,000 jobs. The Peak Cluster jobs breakdown is as follows:

Over 2,000 existing jobs in the cement and lime industry supported

Around 300 new jobs created at manufacturing sites

1,200 temporary jobs created for the construction of the pipeline and capture facilities

Additional quotes

Paul Lafferty, Summit Energy Evolution Ltd CEO, said:

At SEEL, we have a considered focus on new energy and decarbonisation projects, leveraging Sumitomo Corporation’s interest across a broad spectrum of low carbon technologies, including hydrogen and CCS.

Peak Cluster, as the largest cement CCS project globally, is a hugely compelling opportunity to drive this sector towards sustainability. We are delighted to have the opportunity to invest in Peak Cluster alongside the National Wealth Fund.

Diana Casey, Chair of the Mineral Products Association said:

Around 40% of all the UK’s vital cement and lime comes from the Peak District and more than 2,000 high-quality, well-paid jobs across the region are reliant on the industry. However, cement is responsible for 7.5% of all human-made CO₂ emissions globally and is not a sector which can be easily decarbonised. If our industry, and the jobs which rely on it, are to survive, and thrive into the future, we must implement carbon capture and storage without delay.

Centrica Group Chief Executive and Chair of Spirit Energy, Chris O’Shea, said:

This landmark first investment in carbon capture by the National Wealth Fund is an important and exciting step forward for the UK’s net zero ambitions, and our plans for Morecambe specifically. By transforming the Morecambe gas fields into the UK’s largest carbon store, Spirit Energy will provide the critical infrastructure needed to decarbonise hard-to-abate industries like cement and lime.

The support of the National Wealth Fund, alongside private sector investment, demonstrates the strength of our collective commitment to a low-carbon future—securing jobs and growth, decarbonising industry, and delivering real progress on emissions reduction.

Olivia Powis, CEO of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association said:

The National Wealth Fund’s significant equity investment of £28.6m in the Peak Cluster is fantastic news for the future of the cement and lime industry in the UK. It is further recognition of the vital role of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) in decarbonising and futureproofing our critical industries.

CCUS is essential for industries that produce products that enable us to build the homes, hospitals and schools we desperately need. Around 40% of the UK’s cement and lime industry is produced by companies in the Peak Cluster and so this critical project will make significant inroads into cutting CO2 emissions from our cement industry and permanently storing the emissions in the Spirit Energy’s offshore CO2 store - Morecambe Net Zero. Transitioning industries to low-carbon operations is vital for their long-term viability and competitiveness in the UK, and will protect many thousands of skilled jobs in the region, providing economic growth and security.

Neil McCulloch, CEO of MNZ’s developer, Spirit Energy, said:

The NWF’s investment sends a crucially important and thoroughly positive message to those eyeing the UK for investment in the low carbon developments needed to power our economy and help deliver the government’s economic growth and decarbonisation.

Through our partnership with the Peak Cluster, Spirt Energy’s MNZ carbon store will decarbonise 40% of this country’s cement production, safeguard thousands of traditional jobs and livelihoods, breathe new life into the North West’s industrial heartlands and help create new, highly-skilled jobs for this and for future generations.

The NWF’s support demonstrates how industry and government can work together effectively to unlock the investment required to make the energy transition happen, and how the UK can show the rest of the world how to get it done.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a37db09e5274a7908e352b4/s960_HMT_buiding_plaque.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 10:06:53.102031

(NYSE:AMRC) has renewed its contract with the Government of Nunavut to provide enterprise asset management software and professional services, the company announced Monday.

The renewal continues a partnership that began in 2011, with Nunavut using Ameresco’s AssetPlanner platform to manage its portfolio of over 1,200 buildings and 2,500 vehicles and equipment assets spread across nearly 2 million square kilometers of Arctic territory. The contract renewal comes as Ameresco demonstrates strong recent momentum, with InvestingPro data showing a 10.66% stock return in the past week, despite broader market challenges.

The software-as-a-service contract includes the AssetPlanner subscription along with professional advisory services, virtual and on-site training, and support. The platform helps consolidate previously disparate data into a single system.

""This renewal and continued investment in the AssetPlanner system and Ameresco’s advisory services will continue to provide us with critical tools to support the capital planning, tactical maintenance management, and proactive energy management of our vast portfolio,"" said Paul Diamond, Director of Facility Management at the Government of Nunavut, according to the press release.

Tim Dettlaff, Senior Vice President and General Manager at Ameresco, said the renewed engagement will provide Nunavut staff with ""industry-leading tools to manage their vast asset inventory and enable informed decision making.""

Ameresco’s AssetPlanner platform currently tracks over 3 billion square feet of real estate data, according to the company statement.

Based in Framingham, Massachusetts, Ameresco provides energy solutions including efficiency measures, infrastructure upgrades, and distributed energy resources to government, utility, education, healthcare, and commercial customers in North America and Europe. The company has demonstrated robust growth with revenue increasing 30.13% over the last twelve months, maintaining a healthy liquidity position with a current ratio of 1.57. According to InvestingPro, which offers comprehensive analysis and 13 additional key insights about Ameresco’s financial health and market position, the stock currently appears undervalued based on its Fair Value assessment.

In other recent news, Ameresco, Inc. reported a successful sale of approximately $71 million in Investment Tax Credits related to its landfill-gas-to-renewable natural gas projects, marking its first sale under new transferability rules. This transaction underscores Ameresco’s ability to capitalize on clean energy incentives, facilitated by the STX Group. The company also announced the commercial operation of a 1.3 MW solar photovoltaic system at Reston Town Center in Virginia, developed in partnership with BXP, Inc. This project is expected to generate around 1.5 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy annually.

In addition, Ameresco is competing with several other firms for a $3 billion energy and water conservation contract overseen by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The contract aims to reduce energy and water consumption, along with associated costs. Furthermore, UBS analysts recently raised Ameresco’s stock price target to $11 from $8, maintaining a Sell rating. This adjustment reflects a more optimistic view of Ameresco’s federal contracting business, which constitutes a significant portion of the company’s project backlog.

(Nasdaq: FCEL) President and CEO Jason Few has issued a statement praising the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) for its direct support of the fuel cell industry and its role in strengthening America’s energy infrastructure, data center resilience, and clean manufacturing base.

“The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ is a landmark for American energy leadership—and it’s time to set the record straight: clean energy was not sidelined,” said Few. “In fact, the bill includes direct, powerful provisions that support the fuel cell industry and reinforce the United States’ position as a global leader in data center infrastructure and grid resilience.”

Few highlighted the reinstatement of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) as a key win for the sector. He also emphasized the importance of preserving the transferability of federal tax credits, calling it “very important—especially for small- and mid-sized companies—to maintain the ability to monetize these credits.”

FuelCell Energy also expressed support for Congress’ decision to modify hydrogen provisions in the bill, ensuring stability for companies that have already made significant investments in hydrogen.

“Supporters of the OBBBA deserve credit for moving the conversation toward a more inclusive, American-built and led, innovation-driven—and yes, clean—energy policy,” Few concluded.

Full Statement from Jason Few, President & CEO of FuelCell Energy

“The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ is a landmark for American energy leadership—and it’s time to set the record straight: clean energy was not sidelined. In fact, the bill includes direct, powerful provisions that support the fuel cell industry and reinforce the United States’ position as a global leader in data center infrastructure and grid resilience.

One of the most impactful elements of the legislation is the reinstatement of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC). By maintaining full ITC eligibility for fuel cell technologies, the bill ensures that companies like FuelCell Energy can continue to deploy U.S.-built platforms at scale. This is not just about clean energy—it’s about national competitiveness, energy security, and the infrastructure backbone of the AI economy.

The ITC’s flexibility—especially its transferability and long-term visibility—gives developers and investors the confidence to accelerate deployment. That means more resilient power for data centers, more stable grids in the face of extreme weather, and more American jobs in advanced manufacturing.

We especially applaud Congress’ decision to preserve the transferability of key federal tax credits. It’s particularly important for small- and mid-sized companies to maintain the ability to monetize these credits. That flexibility facilitates the financing they need to grow. If a mid-size, highly specialized manufacturer can go from one full-time production shift to two or even three, that’s more U.S. jobs and faster deployment of power solutions.

In addition, we support Congress’ decision to modify the hydrogen provisions in the OBBBA. We recognize that many companies have made significant investments in hydrogen. Congress made the right call in ensuring that those investments are not undermined by sudden policy shifts. That kind of stability is essential for long-term innovation.

Let’s be clear: the OBBBA doesn’t pick winners and losers—it recognizes the unique strengths of each clean energy technology. Fuel cells are dispatchable, scalable, and built for the demands of a digital, electrified future. This bill gives us the tools to lead.

We appreciate all the work that has been done in the House and Senate on behalf of the energy sector, and we believe the supporters of the OBBBA deserve credit for moving the conversation toward a more inclusive, American-built and led, innovation-driven—and yes, clean—energy policy.”

The big picture: Democratic and green group campaigns will argue the GOP's ""big beautiful bill"" that President Trump signed Friday will raise costs and cut jobs.
The other side: While several polls show the bill is unpopular, Republicans will look to play political offense — especially emphasizing tax cuts and border security measures.
Nor did emphasizing clean energy investments stop them from losing the Senate or White House last year, despite messaging on jobs and costs.
Some projects are already getting canceled as Trump officials pull back funding under the IRA and 2021 infrastructure law.","The 2026 midterms will test clean energy's uncertain political salience as advocates attempt to tether it to economic matters that voters prioritize.

Why it matters: Both chambers of Congress are narrowly divided and up for grabs next year.

The big picture: Democratic and green group campaigns will argue the GOP's ""big beautiful bill"" that President Trump signed Friday will raise costs and cut jobs.

It will be an effort to flip the script on the inflation emphasis and promises of lower costs that were a foundation of the GOP's 2024 message.

State of play: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's early list of targeted districts overlaps heavily with 13 House Republicans who voted for their chamber's plan but urged the Senate to soften it.

They include competitive seats held by Republicans like Jen Kiggans (Va.), Gabe Evans (Colo.) and Juan Ciscomani (Ariz.).

""Despite falsely proclaiming their concerns, House Republicans — including some of their most vulnerable members — knowingly voted to cut jobs, slash investments, and raise energy costs in their districts when they voted for the Big, Ugly Bill,"" DCCC spokeswoman Courtney Rice tells Axios.

The other side: While several polls show the bill is unpopular, Republicans will look to play political offense — especially emphasizing tax cuts and border security measures.

Republicans plan to message their legislative victory by branding Democrats' opposition as voting to raise taxes on small businesses and American families, according to an internal memo from the GOP's House campaign's arm shared with Axios' Kate Santaliz.

Friction point: Look for Dems and allied groups to cite recent analyses on two topics — IRA and infrastructure law investments and jobs flowing heavily to red states and districts, and potential for higher utility bills when incentives go away.

Reality check: The political relevance of low-carbon energy is unclear at best. Democrats lost the House in 2022, shortly after the IRA's passage.

Nor did emphasizing clean energy investments stop them from losing the Senate or White House last year, despite messaging on jobs and costs.

I'm not saying the IRA is why they lost, but there are plenty of reasons to question its political potency, and more broadly whether voters will prioritize clean tech.

As our colleague Hans Nichols notes, the election cycle is still early, and other potential events — such as war or recession — can always make the current issue set look small.

Yes, but: This time around, candidates can point more easily to the risk of investments in specific states and districts.

Some projects are already getting canceled as Trump officials pull back funding under the IRA and 2021 infrastructure law.

What's next: League of Conservation Voters President Pete Maysmith tells Axios that votes on the bill will play a ""very significant role"" in their midterm election work — and gave a taste of messages to come.

""The Republican Congress just broke their promise to the American people and to voters, and that was to cut costs, and instead, what they've done is jack up costs, starting with people's utility bills, but not stopping there, including health care, groceries and a myriad of other things,"" he said in an interview.

Even U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright piled on: “When you hitch your wagon to the weather, it’s a risky endeavor.”

There’s just one problem with this blame-renewables narrative: it’s completely wrong.

In this crossover episode with the Redefining Energy podcast, we examine the official Spanish grid operator report that reveals a complex web of failures.

While the blackout began with a solar plant sending frequency oscillations through the grid, what followed was a cascade of problems: conventional generators that failed to provide required voltage control, inadequate battery storage to balance massive solar capacity, weak interconnections to neighboring grids, and ultimately, poor system management by grid operators themselves.

Our guests, Laurent Segalen of Megawatt-X and Gerard Reid of Alexa Capital — co-hosts of Redefining Energy — help us decode what went wrong and what Spain needs to fix.

“Spain has installed 30 gigawatts of solar in the past 10 years and there’s hardly any batteries and there’s hardly any connection with the rest of the continent,” explained Segalen. “The system has become more fragile.”

“We’ve had, in the UK, an interconnector going down, 1.4 gigawatts. Well, guess what? There was no blackout. Why? Because batteries came in straight away,” said Reid.

We’ll discuss the many factors behind the outage, and explore why Spain’s grid operator is trying to avoid blame.

Then, we’ll look at how security is reshaping European energy investment. As America leans into its role as a dominant petrostate and pulls back from post-World War II security commitments, Europe is being forced to reconsider how to structure clean energy supply chains.

We also explore the emerging split between “petrostates” and “electrostates” — countries that control energy through scarcity versus those that build abundance through manufacturing and technology. While America doubles down on fossil fuel dominance, can Europe position itself alongside China as a leading electrostate?

Stephen Lacey: Are vote-a-ramas in the Senate as fun as they sound?

Katherine Hamilton: I know. Doesn’t a vote-a-rama sound like a drinking game where every time you hear the word repeal, everybody has to take a shot?

Stephen Lacey: Gerard, Laurent, what is the word you would use to describe what’s happening here in the US right now?

Gerard Reid: Chaos. No, that’s the only word I would use is chaos.

Laurent Segalen: I’ve got other C’s for you, coercion, confusion, crypto corruption, China, climate, culture war, cruelty, capture, cluelessness, craziness, collapse, crony capitalism, complacency, coerceness, contempt, court of the medieval king. These are all my C’s.

Stephen Lacey: Did you just rattle that off the top of your head?

Laurent Segalen: I prepared this for some weeks now.

Stephen Lacey: From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. When 47 million people lose power, who do you blame? In April, the lights went out across Spain and Portugal and without an immediate explanation, the finger pointing started. “Too much renewable energy,” declared the critics. Even the US energy secretary piled on the blame. There’s just one problem with this narrative. It’s completely wrong. Now, we have the facts and they tell a very different story about voltage control, grid coordination, and the urgency of grid modernization. Then, we’ll revisit the New Joule Order with a European twist. As America dismantles the post-World War II global security order and leans into its role as a petrostate, how will Europe respond? We’ll look at how security is reshaping the EU’s role as an emerging electrostate.

I’m Stephen Lacey. I’m the Executive Editor at Latitude Media. Welcome. I’m joined as always by my two co-hosts, Katherine Hamilton and Jigar Shah. Katherine is the co-founder and chair of 38 North Solutions. Hey, Katherine.

Katherine Hamilton: Hey, so excited to be doing this.

Stephen Lacey: Indeed. Jigar is the co-managing partner of Multiplier and former director of the DOE’s Loan Programs Office. Hey, Jigar.

Jigar Shah: Hey.

Stephen Lacey: So before we bring in our guests and collaborators, I want to just timestamp this week’s episode for our American listeners. We are recording on Wednesday, July 2nd. The Senate just passed its version of the Reconciliation Bill that makes changes to clean energy tax credits. It’s going to go over to the house now. This is an ongoing situation. You’re going to hear this episode on July 7th so so much is going to probably change between now and then. Katherine, what’s the state of play as we know it right now?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah. So the Senate passed the bill with some changes to the House bill that would make it slightly less horrible for solar and wind. Still not great but slightly less worse. And then, it went over to the House side. They are supposed to take it up this week. And again, you’re going to hear this after all of this. And with the president hoping to sign a bill on the 4th of July, our Independence Day too, with lots of fireworks to celebrate something that will turn us back in time not only from a lot of major social programs. But also, in clean energy.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. And we’re going to have a more real-time conversation on what it all means for US infrastructure later in the week. But this week, we have a special treat. We have not one but two leading European energy investment experts here with us, Laurent Segalen and Gerard Reid, the co-hosts of the Redefining Energy podcast. Laurent Segalen founded Megawatt-X, a London-based energy transition investment platform. He’s been trading and investing billions of euros in clean energy for over two decades. Laurent, welcome.

Laurent Segalen: Well, thank you so much for having us. It’s a very emotional moment for us because the Energy Gang, the original Energy Gang, was our inspiration when we set up our podcast and we… I’m getting very emotional so I just have to say one thing and then I’ll let Gerard speak. Times have changed and times are strange. Here I come but I ain’t the same. Mama, I’m coming home.

Stephen Lacey: What a good way to start the show. I love it. Gerard, can you beat that?

Gerard Reid: Oh my god. What can I say after-

Katherine Hamilton: Is Gerard also going to sing? Yes.

Gerard Reid: I am definitely not going to sing. But I do want to say he’s dead right because myself and Laurent we’re in a pub one night having some beers and we were talking about your podcast. And we were thinking, “Actually, we could do something similar, couldn’t we?” So we did and it’s so great to be with you guys here today. It’s brilliant. Really looking forward to this exchange.

Stephen Lacey: Excellent. Well, Gerard Reid is a founding partner of Alexa Capital and an expert on commodities and energy and mobility transitions. It’s really good to see you.

Gerard Reid: Great to be here. Great to be here.

Spain’s blackout: What really happened and lessons learned

Stephen Lacey: Well, we brought you both here to talk about this really critical moment for Europe and we are going to start in Spain where on April 28th the entire Iberian Peninsula went dark for nearly half a day, crippling communications and transportation infrastructure. And the cause at first was a bit of a mystery and almost immediately in the US, we saw the usual suspects. People like Michael Shellenberger and Robert Bryce out there saying the cause was renewables. We saw Fox News featuring segments blaming solar. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright weighed in telling CNBC, “When you hitch your wagon to the weather, it’s a risky endeavor.” We decided to wait until we had an official report from Spain’s grid operator and now we have it and it paints a very different picture. So who wants to take a whack at explaining what happened in more detail?

Laurent Segalen: The fascinating thing in Spain is that contrary to all other blackouts, South Australia at 2016 or Storm Uri in Texas or the heat waves, there was no weather event. It arrives on a kind of normal day. So you need to go much deeper into the structural route and the fact that Spain has installed 30 gig of solar in the past 10 years and there’s hardly any batteries and there’s hardly any connection with the rest of the continent so they have created… The system has become more fragile. Now, in order to balance the system without batteries or interconnection, you need to use your CCGTs as backup and they have… Spain as 30 gigawatt of CCGTs. But guess what? The whole system was not managed. That’s how we see it. Gerard, maybe a bit more granular explanation?

Gerard Reid: Well, Laurent, I think I actually want to say something slightly different which is the question is what can we learn from this, right? And I’ll tell you what I would say first and foremost is that electricity is indispensable to our modern life, right? The Portuguese utility was speaking to one of the senior executives there and he made a point he couldn’t even get into his home when the power failure happened because guess what? He had an electric doorbell. And this is the biggest point that I would make…

And by the way, this was only a blackout, right? For a day. It wasn’t even a day. But can you imagine you do this for three days, what happens to society? And so, the learning that we would take all of it out of is just how serious blackouts are and we cannot afford for this type of thing to happen. And by the way, it’s not just, again, about blackouts, it’s also we need to think about resilience of the system in general, whether it’s climate-related, storm damage, fires, it could even be terrorist attacks. We need to think about these in a way. So the learning that I think of it was we need to rethink the way the system works and the way it’s managed and we need to do this very quickly. That’s the learning I take out of it, right?

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. And certainly, Texans here know a lot about multi-day blackouts and the consequences. Let me provide a really succinct explanation of what happened according to Red Electrica and then I want to get you out to weigh in on it so it wasn’t necessarily a renewable energy failure. It started with, according to them, a solar plant sending frequency oscillations through the grid which should have, in theory, been manageable.

But then, the conventional power plants that are paid to stabilize the grid did not do their jobs. And instead of absorbing excess voltage, they pumped more in and the result was this 27-second cascade that turned off the lights for 47 million people. Katherine, what do you understand happened here? Was this an issue with conventional generators not doing their job? Was it the solar’s problem? How do you think about who’s responsible here?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah. Well, according to Red Electrica’s report, they were completely not responsible. When I was reading it, it was super confusing because I tried to follow the tick tock of everything that happened because they went sort of minute-by-minute. And the voltage would drop, there would be an oscillation, and then they would say, “But that should have been manageable and this should have been manageable and this should have been manageable.” And it just seemed like it was really a cascading set of events because there wasn’t this overarching, as Gerard says, this overarching systems thinking around what’s really going on here. It was very, very hard to actually decipher from that report what happened and if anybody was really to blame other than maybe the utility in some way. But I would love to hear the folks who are actually living there.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. Well, I want to get your take, Jigar, here. What do you take from this Red Electrica report on where the blame lies? Was it the fact that these conventional power plants that, again, were paid to stabilize the grid were not providing those services?

Jigar Shah: Yeah. I think when you look at the through line from Uri to the Christmas surprise in 2022 to this project, the challenge is that the way people are trained to run the grid is the same as they’ve been trained in the 1980s, right? So they absolutely rely on inertia, rely on other things. I think today we are in a new place because solar is so large that you need access to data. I mean, the big challenge that I see with all of these is that solar projects are just so new.

And remember in the 1980s, we banned solar from providing all of these services. It’s not that inverter-based systems can’t provide some of this VAR support or frequency support or other things. It’s that they’re banned from doing that. We updated IEEE 1547 recently to allow for some of these services to be provided, but many of the inverter systems that are installed today don’t have these services.

And so, one, most of the independent system operators don’t get the real-time data on solar projects that they have from thermal projects. And so, we need to correct some of the data pieces here because that allows for folks to curtail load or curtail generators, do all the things that they normally when they have that data.

But the second piece of it is, as we are reminded over and over again, solar is not capacity even though we want it to be capacity. Batteries are capacity. And so, ultimately, as Laurent suggested, the Iberian Peninsula has to catch up to where the UK is, to where Germany is, to where other places are that have a far more healthy ratio of batteries to solar. I think when you think about where we are headed in a very high penetration grid, batteries is what you rely on for capacity. It’s not the solar panels themselves.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. So Laurent, you want to jump on that. You talked about the massive Spanish solar capacity but very little battery storage and the lack of a integrated regional grid. Where do you put the blame here? Are you sort of pointing to the lack of storage as the big problem?

Laurent Segalen: At the end of the day, it’s up to Red Electrica to manage their systems and they have to work with what they have. So the batteries are going to come but that’s true what Jigar say. It comes much later than in other countries. So if you don’t have batteries, if you don’t have interconnection, you need to work with your gas fleet. And the way they have managed with their gas fleet… Now, of course, I read the report from Red Electrica. The next day, Iberdrola was putting another counter report saying, “Sorry. It’s not the gas plant, it’s you.”

Now, the trick is nobody needs to take the blame because the next day the insurance company are going to arrive and say, “Sorry, guys. I’ve got X billion of losses. Report says it’s on you so now you’re going to pay.” So you’re going to see a lot of reports coming blaming the other guys because nobody wants to be named responsible for financial reasons. And at the end of the day, they’re just going to kick the count down the road. Now, Gerard is right. Everybody know what needs to be done: interconnection. That’s going to take years. So batteries, yes, the short-term or the medium-term and in the short-term, they need to manage better. And as Jigar said, maybe they have a grid following inverters, they need to switch to grid forming inverters. But look, there are a lot of solution short-term if they manage better,

Katherine Hamilton: Is there a regulatory solution?

Jigar Shah: I think that’s exactly right, Katherine which is that I think that as the solar industry and the wind industry and the battery industry continue to scale, they need to be treated like infrastructure. And so, the regulator needs to start saying, “Here are the additional costs that you need to incur to be able to manage a high penetration grid in a way that our grid operators are familiar with these tools. I think that there are a lot of ways for us to theoretically run a grid. Frankly, using computers and AI and all sorts of stuff, right?

But today, we are in a place where the grid operators run things the way that they’re comfortable in running things. And when things that are not familiar to them come forward, then things get shaky. I just think that when you’re 80% of all grid connections in the entire world which is where solar and battery storage are today, we have to recognize that we need to bring everyone along with us. I don’t think that solar was to blame directly for this blackout but I do think that this is going to increasingly happen as there is a shift, really, to higher and higher penetrations of renewables and the grid operators are not really set up to deal with that.

Gerard Reid: Yeah. Listen, the thing that I just want to add to it is when I hear a solar plant goes down, what was it? 300 megawatts. Now, that’s nothing in the larger scheme of things and I’ll just give you a really simple example. I mean, we’ve had, in the UK, an interconnector going down, 1.4 gigawatts. Well, guess what? There was no blackout. Why? Well, because batteries came in straight away, right? Immediately came in.

And technology-wise, what you need to have is grid forming inverters in there that can react much quicker than a synchronous generator can. So for me, there’s a technology solution there. And I want to say… And I understand why Red Electrica don’t put their hand up and say, “Listen, we made a mistake,” but the reality is they did because there’s just no way around it. But it’s political now because the Spanish government is under pressure already and they don’t want to take blame or responsibility for this.

But that’s why I go back to what can we learn from this? And what we can learn is that we really need to make sure that we have the technologies in place to make sure this type of thing doesn’t happen again. And I will say, as we record, I just want to give you an idea of what happened in the power markets in Europe this week. So what we had is massive heat waves across Europe which means massive amounts of solar on the system and huge amounts of air conditioning, okay?

And then, guess what? No wind across the whole continent. And no wind means that you can imagine when the sun goes in, what happens? Power prices explode. Like they go from zero to, in some markets, 1,000 euros a megawatt hour but the system didn’t fall over, right? Because it’s got its incredible resilience within that system and the market worked. I want to give an example of… It does work, the Spanish just did a really bad job. That’s what I just want to say, right? Really bad job. That’s what we take out of it and it’s not a European problem. For me, it is a Spanish problem.

Stephen Lacey: Jigar, if I were to bring you on Fox… I just want to distill this down here. Jigar, if I were to bring you on Fox News and I asked you, “Solar power is to blame, right?” What would be your short, pithy answer on how we place blame for this particular incident?

Jigar Shah: That all technologies basically have to be coordinated like an orchestra and when the conductor fails to do their job, it’s not the fault of any one section of the orchestra that the sound is not beautiful, right? It’s the fault of the conductor. And so, in this case, it is again the fault of the conductor. Now, does each section need to have its own session where they need to tighten themselves up, they need to provide better leadership for the rest of the orchestra? Yes. But ultimately, the conductor has to take the blame.

Stephen Lacey: So Spain now has this decree, this anti-blackout decree. They are really leaning into renewables and distributed energy as part of their efforts to modernize the grid, strengthen the grid. What do they need to be doing as part of this decree to make sure that that expansion and those standards are meeting the right problem?

Laurent Segalen: Look, this means so much renewables put in the system. That if you look at the load factor of the CCGTs, if you take a British or Texan, you’re in the 45 to 50% load factor. So CCGT can make a reasonable living. But in Spain, you’re down to 25%. So in fact, those CCGTs are really fighting for relevance. On the top of that, we don’t have cheap gas. We need to import expensive gas. So they are really doing the minimum and there is this permanent stress between the gas operators and the system so they want more money and can say, “Oh, no, no. We don’t have the budget to do that.” So that’s the difficult situation which means that somehow, maybe there is a temptation to organize mini-crisis so they can be paid to solve those crises. And whatever decrease that stress inside the gas or the balancing system in Spain is going to remain. Because frankly, you don’t make any money by having to import expensive LNG and running only 25% of the time. So that’s an economic reality.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah. I just wanted to give a couple of examples of times when we’ve had either blackouts or potential blackouts and what the technology solutions have been in the US and North America generally. So in 2003, I was in the Adirondacks expecting my fourth baby and we had the Northeast blackout. Remember, it hit the US and Ontario. I just thought since I was in my cabin, it was like the usual which is we always get blackouts. But what it ended up being was a tree on a branch in Cleveland. It took them a year to figure out that that was the cause of it. This was in 2003, so it was a long time ago. And since then, of course, the US has invested in grid technologies like synchrophasers that are giving them more visibility to the grid.

You fast forward to 2017 when there was a solar eclipse, remember? And it was going to take out… It started in California. It was going to be worst in California. And I was actually sitting in the California ISO when they were preparing for it and trying to figure out, “How are we going to manage the system as all these solar panels go down?” And what happened was 750,000 Nest thermostats were able to pre-cool homes so that they could turn air conditioning off as solar came off of the grid and it managed 100 million solar panels and was able to take on over 5% of what was lost with solar. Just through Nest thermostats. So that was in 2017.

Fast forward to today where we have, as you know, all of the issues around bad weather, hurricane Uri, and in Texas, the system operator, ERCOT, has just put out a report that says, “Our blackout risk has reduced from 16% below 1%.” And why is that? It’s because we have almost 10 gigawatts of capacity, over half of it in solar and four gigawatts of batteries and they are saying this is going to reduce our risk of blackout. So it’s very interesting the way over time, and it’s been over decades, we’ve been able to come up with technology solutions. That eventually, the grid operators are realizing, “Ah, these are the tools that we can use.” I think a lot of that has to do with innovation and more systems thinking. But it’s hopeful for the grid, I would think in Europe as well.

Jigar Shah: Well, and this is what I was suggesting before around what it looks like to be a grown-up industry that wants to be viewed as infrastructure and not just a bespoke solution that gets integrated into something. When you look at the way that California runs, they generally hate virtual power plants and distributed energy resources. They have 3,000 megawatts of behind-the-meter batteries and they have an integrated… The system, right? That’s a choice that they make. They pine for the past. They don’t want to embrace the future.

By the way, the same thing is true in China, right? China curtails so much of its renewables because it has a software integration problem which is largely being solved by startups in the US and Europe. Now, those ISOs though need to embrace those software solutions. Like we’ve talked about Pearl Street for instance and how they can do an interconnection study in 24 hours that normally takes GE and Siemens engineers 22,000 hours to do. These are all technologies that we’ve invented. When you look at ERCOT and how accurate their wind forecasts are now, they can predict an hour before exactly what’s going to happen in the future, which matters because it takes that full hour to ramp up the natural gas engines.

And so, that technology all exists and it’s all been proven in different independent system operators. But every independent system operator takes its own sweet time to figure out when it wants to pay for those software solutions. And then, Laurent and his investment firm ends up being like, “Damn you. Why do we need to raise more money for this company when they could get more revenue? Why can’t we just get people to buy this software? Why can’t we get them to implement these solutions faster?”

So I would suggest to you that, again, this is a cultural problem, right? Which is that people are used to doing things at the way they’ve always done things and they are trying really hard to say, “How do you make your solution look exactly like what I’m familiar with?” And unfortunately, we can only do that most of the way. We can’t do that all of the way. And so, there are actual real changes that we have to make.

But the beauty is we have all these solutions, as Katherine has suggested. But the challenge is in every single market, and I mean every market, whether it’s the Northeast United States, California, Illinois, the Midwest independent system operator, PJM, the Iberian Peninsula, every one of them seems to have their blind spots. And that is the responsibility of the clean energy industry to fund organizations that actually fill those blind spots. You have to pay more money at the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners’ conferences. You have to pay more money at all these gatherings to educate people and we have, what you call, been skimpy on those budgets.

Gerard Reid: What I’d add to you, Jigar, is I thought what you said is very interesting, which is a cultural problem. And we’re clear, if you were a grid operator, you are not paid to innovate. You have no incentive to innovate. What you’ve got is one incentive and one job and that’s to keep the grid up. That’s all. And as long as you do that, you’re happy. And you see what happens in the Spanish case. And even when they don’t keep the grid up, they blame someone else.

Jigar Shah: And the one thing I think we do need to keep in mind, which maybe I should have said earlier in this segment, is that the reports that we’ve gotten so far are preliminary reports, that are what you call political in nature in my opinion. I think when you think about what Katherine suggested for the 2003 blackout, that took a year to really figure out and this will also take a year to really figure out. And so, I just want to make sure that people understand that the actual scientific report that we are waiting on will take a lot longer. Probably in 2026 before we get that published.

Stephen Lacey: So we’ve walked through a bunch of different solutions. I want to wrap this part of the conversation up and go around the horn. If you were to make recommendations for any sort of regulatory change, technological change, let’s distill this down for our listeners. What are the big changes we need to see?

Gerard Reid: Maybe I’ll start with the sort of big picture, right? Because for me, the big picture is energy security and that is we cannot do without electricity. So we have to rethink. It’s not about renewables or anything like that. As I said, there is a whole pile of other stresses that are in the power system in the 21st century. We have to recognize those stresses and those risks and change how we manage the grid. Because for me, it starts with the management of the grid and the future management of the grid is all about data.

Laurent Segalen: Yeah. So Gerard is a big strategist. Me, I’m a very simple man. So I just say, battery, battery batteries, software, software, software. That’s it. And forget about the regulation, just do the thing.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah. I would say better planning. We need a lot better planning. We need all of the resources to know and to prove what can they provide, when they can provide it, be called upon, be penalized if they’re not there, and actually have that all built into a much more holistic planning scenario.

Jigar Shah: Yeah. I agree. I’d say that we actually have all the data that we need to meet the transmission system operator and distribution system operator’s requirements. But we don’t often send it and when we do send it, they don’t often read it. And so, figuring out exactly how to do that is the software piece that I think Laurent was talking about.

I think on the batteries piece, and to Katherine’s point on planning, I mean, there does just need to be a recognition that transmission will always be the bottleneck. It was clearly in the Iberian Peninsula case, right? Because of their interconnections to the rest of the grid being weak but it will always be the bottleneck. And so, when that is the case, the clean energy solutions and solar and wind have to be forced to use the transmission system more efficiently. That means the ratio of batteries to renewables on each individual circuit needs to be managed. They can either be co-located, they can be separated, but they actually have to be on the same circuit.

And the same thing’s true as on the demand side. You’re going to start putting way more batteries in to optimize the transmission grid from that side, right? The transmission grid itself can actually transport double, triple the amount of power that we currently transmit with that system. But the problem is is that when you think about exactly what the timing is of when everything gets used, you need a lot more batteries to manage the timing. And so, that’s why I think whether it’s distributed capacity procurement that folks are doing in the US or whether it’s virtual powerplants or DERs or whether it’s just utility scale batteries, that planning function is something that is being done in a haphazard way today.

Stephen Lacey: And I guess I’ll round this out by saying one thing that stood out for me in the Red Electrica report was that these conventional generators that tripped offline were supposed to provide voltage control. They were legally obligated to provide voltage control and they did not. So I don’t know if that’s a regulatory enforcement issue, if that’s a communications issue. But certainly, that is a big piece of what happened here. So what I take away from this conversation is they need to do a little bit or a lot of everything.

Laurent Segalen: Well said.

Europe’s energy security and the petrostate vs Electrostate framework

Stephen Lacey: Let’s move on to a much bigger story about European energy security. So back in April, we had a conversation about a report from the investment firm, Carlyle, called The New Joule Order which argued that global investment flows in clean energy would be more influenced by security and localization of supply than decarbonization. And we asked, “Are we leaving the net-zero era into the energy security era?” And one of the precipitating factors of all this was America’s changing role in the global stage. As the US leans into its role as a dominant petrostate and pulls back on its post-World War II security commitments to protect supply routes, countries are re-evaluating their energy security and creating what Carlyle’s Jeff Currie says as peak trade of fossil fuels.

So a sequel to that report is out, it’s focused squarely on Europe. It looks at Europe’s defense imperative as America pulls away and the plan argues that Europe needs to spend 9 trillion euros over the next decade to build a very different economy. One with electrons and local supply chains at the center largely for security reasons. And this pairs really nicely with another analysis from two Columbia University scholars arguing that we’re in the middle of this split between two fundamentally different economic models, the petrostate versus the electrostate.

In petro states like America, Saudi Arabia, Russia, control energy through scarcity, through dominance of choke points, power through barrels and pipelines. And electrostates, particularly China and Europe, build abundance through manufacturing, advantages through technology, and generate value through innovation rather than extraction. It’s a very simplified way of looking at things but I think that’s how you sort of define the difference between petrostates and electrostates.

So America is now really leaning into, as I said, the petrostate strategy. And the question is, can Europe join China as a leading electrostate and increase both its security and competitiveness. And as it does, what can we learn from Europe’s malinvestment in renewables that was clearly pioneering but also very, very costly? So firstly, Laurent, do you agree with the assertion that security is becoming a more powerful force for Europe’s energy transition than decarbonization? How is that unfolding?

Laurent Segalen: Yeah. Everything changed so nothing changes. It’s still ESG. ESG, except now, and I quote Liam Denning from Bloomberg, ESG means economic security and geopolitics. So that’s the new ESG. The second is the Jeff Currie report was delivered in-person by Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Conference. And Gerard, were you in Munich? I mean, the message was kind of loud and clear.

Gerard Reid: Well, the message was loud and clear which is the future is fossil fuels, right? That’s what we got from the US. And I think what I would say is Europe’s in a sort of difficult situation because at the end of the day, we outsourced our energy future to Russia. That hasn’t worked out. And now, we’re very dependent on the United States but we’re also dependent on Saudi Arabia, et cetera, et cetera. And with the geopolitical situation in the present, you sort of say, “Oh, what can we do?” Well, there’s only one thing we can do and that’s move towards energy independence and the only way you can do that is to electrify.

Now, that’s the big picture, Stephen. So I think we’re all clear, that’s what we have to do. It’s not clear whether Europe is going to do that or not. That’s what I just want to say to you. It is clear that China’s going that route and we do need to go that route but geopolitics are difficult. And what I mean by that is the geopolitical situation is that Europe’s very, very tied into the United States and to break away from the United States means also breaking away from fossil fuels. Is that really going to happen? I’m not 100% sure. I hope it does.

And what I would add though is that the way forward is definitely… We have examples of the way forward in Europe and it’s called the Nordic countries. Because if you’re Norway, Denmark, Sweden, these countries have electrified their economies already, right? France to a certain extent as well but… Particularly, the case of Sweden. Sweden was totally unimpacted by what happened with the Russians cutting off the gas to Europe. The reason was because they don’t use gas. They use minimum amounts of it.

So it’s very clear that is the way going forward. But I would say, the bottleneck in all of this is Germany because Germany’s strategy was always to integrate close to the Russians. And industry has been really badly impacted by the fact that they’re now taking expensive LNG in and I’ve got your German economics minister who wants to go and build more and more gas power stations, which sort of doesn’t break the addiction. So as I said, definitely, we know the path forward and we hope that Europe goes down this road but it’s not clear where we’re going to go down there. Now, Laurent might have a different opinion on this but I certainly don’t think it’s clear.

Laurent Segalen: Yeah. Look, it’s a change of paradigm. If you look 20 years ago, the energy situation in the US and Europe was absolutely the same. We were literally importing molecules. And if you look at the price of power in the US 20 years ago, it was above Europe. When people say, “Oh, the price is crazy now in Europe.” No, if you just take the price of power 20 years ago, you add inflation, this is the price you get now. So the price has kind of followed inflation.

But in the US… I mean, ERCOT was above $60 20 years ago. If you add inflation, that’s $100. Now, the price is below 30. So in fact, in the US, the price of power has gone down to factor three. The reality is, and it’s all because of fracking in the Permian and everything, there’s been an energy divergence. And of course, the politics follow and the politics is the reality is now our interests are not aligned anymore because you enjoy energy dominance and we are left holding the bucket like morons. And yeah, of course, we’re going to do something about it. Now, the alliance with China, yeah, we take a lot of Chinese batteries, Chinese solar panels. There’s no tariff, no problem. Look, at some point, you need to bring answers. They are not pretty but that’s what it is.

Stephen Lacey: Certainly, historically, Europe, more than in the US, has been motivated in its energy transition for environmental reasons. And I’m wondering how you think security plays into Europe’s motivations now compared to environmentalism and climate action. So are we seeing security, urgency, and ownership of supply chains becoming the dominant force like this report suggests?

Laurent Segalen: Oh, yeah. I mean, security after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, yeah, of course. It changed everything all of a sudden. It changed everything. And then, you add AI and all those type of things. I mean, the 2020s are harder, they are more digital, they are more disruptive. And people who stick on their 2010s, software view of the world with Kumbaya, let’s go to cup, let’s decarbonize, let’s all be friends, this area is done. It’s gone. The old ESG thing which was basically you build a portfolio of shares or you go long tech, short oil, and then you say, “Oh, look, ESG is so profitable.” That was not true. So we had a bit of a series of shock and, yeah, we’re adapting to those shocks.

Jigar Shah: I think the part of the story that people miss is that the United States coming out of World War II really had extraordinary amounts of manufacturing capacity. And we were able to use a lot of that manufacturing capacity to make planes and tanks and all sorts of other stuff. And then, when peacetime came, we turned it into an engine for the world. The reason our defense was so strong though was it was less than 5% of the supply chain. So most of it was used to make civilian equipment and 5% of it was used to make defense equipment. Today, our defense supply chains are used only for defense and they are horribly mismanaged. Today, I’m not even sure we could make a carrier if we wanted to. That is how bad our ports are in our shipbuilding capacities.

And so, one of the things that Europe has to figure out how to do is to avoid some of the problems that the United States is in today. So it needs to make sure that when it increases its budgets to 5% of GDP to defense, which many European countries have done, that it is based upon civilian supply chains. Not based on defense supply chains because defense supply chains are horribly corrupt and horribly inefficient. And so, it’s just one of those things that you just cannot build a modern society on pure defense supply chains and the US is falling off a cliff because we’ve ended up there. That takes real planning and that’s the part that scares me the most, is that when you look at what Japan has done around its industrial strategy, it has done things through these keiretsu’s, right? In Korea, it’s through the chaebols and these are major industrial powerhouses that play both roles.

So you start to see conversations around VW taking some of their factories and turning them into defense facilities. That makes tons of sense. They know how to manufacture stuff at scale at very low cost. But if VW starts getting 80% of its revenues from defense, you will see VW become sclerotic which is what’s happened to many of the supply chains in the United States. And so, I just think that people have to be careful. We have this extraordinary opportunity in front of us to use technology that has largely been invented in the west and scale them up in these places.

The other thing I would say is the European experiment which is this sort of EU hybrid, but each country sort of runs itself, has sort of led to the fact that you don’t have this transfer capacity, for instance, between countries on the transmission grid. It has led to a lot of these other challenges. But one of the other opportunities that it presents is there are many low cost areas of Europe. So whether it’s Hungary or Serbia or some of these other places, you can manufacture stuff really dirt cheap there even today.

So the question becomes, how do you get the political consensus across all of these countries to actually manufacture things in places of low cost in Europe? Because right now, Europe really still operates as if France needs to manufacture its own stuff, and Germany needs to manufacture its own stuff, and other people need to have their own sort of companies that are dominant in their countries. And that’s not really the lowest cost approach.

That’s one of the benefits of the United States is that you don’t need a passport to cross state lines. You have this ability to just do stuff in Georgia or do stuff in Florida or do stuff in Wyoming. And so, I think one of the big challenges with the EU experiment in this moment is that they are going to need to figure out whether this moment is the time where they tighten up the coordination across all of the countries or they still operate as a confederation of independent countries.

Stephen Lacey: Gerard, Laurent, what are Europe’s advantages or disadvantages in scaling up manufacturing, specifically in energy and clean energy? What do you make of that?

Gerard Reid: Well, let’s maybe talk about the difficulties that we have and then we can talk about the advantages. So the difficulties that we have are really geopolitical which is remember, we outsourced our energy to Russia? We’ve outsourced our tech to the US and we’ve now exported our industrial technology base to China. And we’re stuck in the middle between these three nations or these three countries that… We have precarious relationships with each of them. And that’s the real big challenge for us going forward is how do we manage the relationships between these three countries going forward?

I don’t know what the answer to that is but it’s the critical challenge because we don’t have the technology. We rely on Microsoft, Google, et cetera, et cetera. If you want to talk about electric vehicles, for example… Sorry. The best electric vehicles in the world are Chinese. They’re BYD. Without a doubt, right? That’s a challenge for the automobile industry in Europe, right? So that’s the challenging environment we have.

Now, let me talk about the advantages. What we have is in certain industries, we are still world leaders. So if you take the case of wind, right? Vestas is still the biggest wind turbine manufacturer in the world. We’ve got incredible grid companies across Europe, whether it’s a Siemens or an ABB or if you want to build power cables or something like this, again, Prysmian, all these sorts. So we’ve got great advantages there. And I think the other area that we’ve got great strength is the whole area of power. It’s controls and actually power controls, whether they be semiconductors or whether they be software. That’s the strength that Europe has.

And so, we have to build on that but that requires us to change our attitude a little bit to realize that, “Listen, we’re not necessarily going to be the biggest in the world at something and maybe we need to partner up with China. Maybe we need to partner up with the US. Do you understand?” So there’s a thinking change that’s also needed in Europe. But we definitely still have industries in the energy space where we’re leading and that’s the advantage we still have.

Laurent Segalen: We were absolutely amazed when the IRA came out and this is really rich people, luxury, and analyzing the IRA, probably from a European point of view, 40% made absolutely no sense because you are so… How do you call that? Profligate which unfortunately we can’t do. And now, you’re back to reality and they’re going to take all the subsidies and that’s it. We’re a mature industry. Okay. So rip the bandaid and do it in one go and go with it and the price of power is going to go up in the US. It’s a very tough moment. But look, I count on your animal spirit and you’ll get through it.

So yeah, a lot of things got to be done by reaction. I’ll take an example, rare earths. Everybody’s complaining about the rare earth. Well, in France, there’s a plant who used to do half of the rare earths processing in the world 20 years ago. It closed because of China but the plant’s still there. You can switch it back on. Boats, yeah, we do a lot of cruise ships. Okay. Are we going to do some submarines tomorrow? Yeah. Maybe. It’s there. And the advantage we have compared to the US is we are much compact. Everything is two hours flight from where we are and people speak different language but they think the same way. And when we see Russia, we see your administration, we see China, I can tell you, people understand very fast what their interest is. So yeah, we’ll muddle through that. Not brilliantly but we’ll get through it.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine, we’ve talked in multiple episodes and in our most recent episode with Kim Zou about how a lot of investors from around the world and in the US are looking to Europe. How do you think Europe might benefit from America’s current retrenchment in clean energy?

Katherine Hamilton: Well, I don’t think anybody in the globe benefits from retrenchment from clean energy. But I would say that the US spends 13% of our federal budget on the military. And that sounds terrifying, except that the military is also the source of a lot of innovation that has big impacts on civilians and not just from a military standpoint. So for example, DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, of course, famously help inspired ARPA-E which is at the Department of Energy. And that’s kind of like startup technologies because the Department of Defense can take a little more risk. They can say, “We’re willing to try this experiment if it’s going to help us somehow deploy what we need to deploy. And if it has other benefits, that’s great.” We also, of course, have a system where the private sector is very, very involved. So it’s not like state-owned technologies, state-owned resources.

But the other big piece is the Defense Production Act. And so, this is a fund that can go to… Well, does go to private sector companies based on national defense, emergency response, essential goals and services that are declared by any president as being a crisis. And it doesn’t have to be a wartime crisis, it could be any crisis. So for example, during the Biden administration, he said, “We have a climate crisis so what are we going to fund through the Department of Defense?” So they funded critical minerals, heat pumps, electronics components. They are still funding like workforce, mining, geological, environmental engineering, metallurgical, all this workforce that we need because we need so many critical minerals right now, no matter what we do. Fabrics they’ve done, aluminum. Battery materials has been a big thing.

President Trump now has said, “Our emergency is for energy supply and infrastructure.” Well, that could mean transmission. It doesn’t necessarily have to mean coal plants. I think he would like for it to mean coal plants. But supply chains, et cetera. So we can put our Department of Defense to work on things that are considered important from a national security standpoint that are also from an energy security standpoint and work our innovation through that.

So we see… My company sees the… The folks that we work with, that are really always interested in non-dilutive funding and programs through the federal government, they see them drying up on the civilian side in a lot of ways. But then on the defense side, they see those growing. And I think that’s something to keep in mind is our Department of Defense does a lot more on innovation than we necessarily think about when we think about security.

Jigar Shah: The one thing I would say that the Carlyle piece focuses on is supply chains and I feel like that is something that Europeans never care about. And it’s something that they are going to have to care a lot about. I’ll give you an example. The Europeans love getting solar panels for 9 cents a watt right now from China. There are so many solar panel manufacturers that can manufacture in Turkey, in Jordan, in Ethiopia, in India at 13 cents a watt instead of 9 cents a watt.

And that is more expensive, I get it. But they should want the diversification of the supply chain for a technology that they depend on to decarbonize their grid. And I think that they will need to be very vigilant around not getting addicted to China. It is not good for them to have 80% of their supply chain coming from one country. It is important for them to strategically invest in other regions in the world, especially where USAID has taken a step back out of the United States. And the Europeans can play this critical role in being the offtake agreement for other countries building up their manufacturing base in their countries. And the Europeans have all of the expertise that they can share with those countries and help them to industrialize their countries.

But I think we’re in this weird spot where the US has always been focused on this and I think even the Trump administration is focused on this, but it’s not clear to me that the Europeans are focused on this. And that, I think, is what scares me the most around what the Carlyle Group has talked about is if the Europeans decide to just say, “You know what? China’s so good at scaling this stuff up. Let’s just do that and we’ll do the finished products over here in Hungary or some other place.” That would be a huge mistake on their part.

Gerard Reid: So I’m going to say it’s game over in solar. So I’m not even going to try and compete with the Chinese in solar. It makes zero sense. They’re technology leaders, they have the scale, complete waste of capital. However, there’s one area which is not and that is batteries. Because batteries is critical not just for our power system, but to the future of the automobile industry which is critical for Europe. But there’s an issue there as well which is China is leading in the technology as well.

The biggest battery manufacturers and technology leaders are all in China. So how do you compete? I actually think you cannot compete by trying to go in alone. We’ve tried this in Europe. We have Northvolt, complete another disaster. 10 billion put into it and nothing out of it. So we have no choice but to compete with the Chinese. You probably go, “Okay. If we’re going to do that, then we really need to cooperate intensely with the South Koreans or the Japanese.” That’s one possibility. Or, the second possibility is you say, “Fuck that. We’re going to go and compete… We’re going to actually cooperate with the Chinese in a different way,” where what we did with them 30 years ago where we went and did joint ventures with them, you do the exact same thing here. So my view would be very, very different. You have to… If you’re going to try and beat the Chinese, you have to beat them at their game and that means cooperate with them firstly. And then, learn from them and then see if you can leapfrog them.

Stephen Lacey: I want to wrap up with this petrostate versus electrostate framing once again and revisit this. Laurent, you flagged this piece for us on this dynamic and the split between electrostates and petrostates. Do you think this is a helpful framework for looking at the world and do you think Europe will emerge as a powerful electrostate?

Laurent Segalen: So first of all, let’s give credit to who coined the term electrostate, that’s our friend, Kingsmill Bond. I think it’s a very valid framework to have a different view. And sometime, you need those meta systems. And I remember the first time I read The Prize by Yergin when he was the great Yergin. Now today, I’m not that sure. Probably he’s past due date. But when I read The Prize, it’s the first time I understood that oil defined the 20th century. So that framework is very useful.

Now, you can come and say, “Oh, what about Canada? What about Brazil? What about Norway?”, which are post exporting fossil fuels and are big on hydro and you’ll be absolutely right. But generally speaking, it’s a very interesting framework. Now, Europe, we’ll tag along. I disagree with Jigar and I’ll give you three examples. Gerard and I, we have invested in a company who was installing solar rooftop in Germany. Yeah. We bought all our panels from Jinko or JS Solar but that was only 2,000 euro per roof. The rest of the value, let’s say 20,000 euro, was all European value. It was our vans. It was our systems. It was our inverters. It was our workers, the job we created.

Right now, I’m investing in batteries. I use CATL, LFP cells but just the cells. The rest, all the battery is made in Europe. And by the way, the Chinese can’t snoop in. There’s no kill switch because there is a cybersecurity law in Europe. So all the software are done in Europe. So whenever I buy a system of battery, let’s say $300,000 a piece, the value of Chinese equipment is less than 10%. So I create 90% value.

And my third example, and that’s something… Somebody we want to salute here is Greg Jackson. So Greg Jackson has created an empire in less than 10 years. Octopus Energy based on digital is now the biggest retail in the UK, starting from zero, and is the first person who has done a bundle retail power and vehicle to grid. But he has done it with BYD. And so, it’s a full package. Your car, power zero, and then when people charge at home, he has access to the BYD batteries and he does demand response with all those batteries. So these are three examples where we leverage on the part of the supply chain where Chinese are really good and we build value locally around it. Okay. So these are three examples. So I don’t make big theories. That’s what I do.

Stephen Lacey: Well, let’s wrap up and get each of your quick takes on the role of Europe as a counterbalance to the United States. So we are seeing more investor interest in Europe. Europe is starting to talk about taking supply chains more seriously. The US’s role in the energy transition is shifting and we are increasingly focused on fossil fuels. So will Europe emerge as a strong counterbalance to the US in the clean energy transition? Gerard, do you want to start?

Gerard Reid: Without a doubt, because we have no choice. In the United States, you have a choice and the choice is you’ve got lots of fossil fuels already so you can actually just stay with them. We have a geopolitical imperative, simple as that. And we also have businesses in this area where we have a competitive advantage. And if I do look at the United States in the energy space, there’s only a handful of businesses that I can think of that are actually international leaders in the space. If I look at Europe, I got a whole pile of leaders and I’d also go and actually look at our utilities as well. Because again, I don’t see… There’s not one US utility in Europe. There’s a whole pile of European utilities in there. So we’ve got a lot of competitive advantage in the space and we have to change, simple as that. So I’d be very positive about our future because the imperative is there.

Jigar Shah: I think the Europeans have a golden opportunity today. As Katherine suggested, I think we’ve spent the better part of 15 years spending a ton of money on innovation and all of that money has resulted in 1,600 companies that Kim Zuo and others are tracking out of London. And so, we actually know exactly which companies they are and which ones need saving and how to save them and all that stuff. But one of the big challenges of Europe is that a lot of these programs have been led by government regulation, feed-in tariffs, top-down sort of approaches. I think that for Europe to succeed in this moment, they’re going to need a lot more large corporates to step up and actually say that they want these things to be in Europe. And so, we’ll see whether they do that. But right now, we are in a critical moment where it can’t be the governments that lead. It has to be the private sector that leads.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah. I’m not really willing to cede clean energy to fossil fuels in the United States. I’m still pretty bullish on clean energy. We’ve already started a lot of manufacturing here. We have deployed MAD and my biggest concern is that we are isolating ourselves such that the Europeans do not want to invest anymore here. And we are looking to what happens in Europe. I do think it’s an opportunity for Europe. I just would hate to cede everything in the US that we’ve tried to get done. So I’m going to keep fighting to make sure that we stay on the clean energy train and that we continue to try to do business with Europe as we can.

Laurent Segalen: So yeah, I started by a song, I’m going to close by a song. “Kathy,” I said, as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh. Michigan seems like a dream to me now. It took me four days to hitch-hike from Saginaw and I’ve come to look for America. I mean, for European, America, these are our cousins, our brethrens. And seeing America at the UN Security Council voting with Iran and North Korea and Russia against us, where have you gone?

Stephen Lacey: Many of us ask that question every day.

Laurent Segalen: Russia is our enemy. If you can finish Iran in 10 days, we can finish Russia in 20. And I can tell you, the world will be so much peaceful. You can decrease every defense budget by 50%. So yeah, I don’t want to cede from America. North Atlantic, this is our Mare Nostrum, this is who we are and I hope you’ll come back to senses. And of course, we need to take more responsibility and not rely on other people, but we are in it together. We only represent 25% of the world population at best but we have the best universities, the best research center. We are bound to do that together. So that’s my final words.

Katherine Hamilton: Amen, brother.

Stephen Lacey: Yes. I think the three of us feel that very deeply and a lot of Americans do as well and that’s part of the reason we wanted to have this conversation. Thanks to both of you. This was a lot of fun. Thanks for your podcasts and also keeping us informed. And Gerard Reid and Laurent Segalen are the co-hosts of Redefining Energy. You can find their show the same way you find this one, anywhere you download podcasts or you can click the link in the show notes and you can get to their page. Gerard, really good to talk to you.

The air board is hosting four meetings in the coming weeks to hear ideas from industry groups, environmentalists and community members about how the state should now approach clean air regulation.

Conservatives say the air board is an unelected board that wields too much power.
Experts and advocates say California will have to approach clean air policy from many angles — mandates and incentives.","At an electric vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Christopher Grundler — one of the top executives in California responsible for cleaning the air — said despite all the setbacks his agency has faced this year, he’s confident the state can keep making progress.

“This president, this Congress, will not kill the electric car,” said Grundler, a deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources Board. “They won’t kill the electric truck, and they certainly won’t kill the California spirit.”

Despite that optimism, California officials — now reined in by the Trump administration and growing concerns about affordability and costs — are struggling to come up with new ways to clean up the nation’s most polluted air.

Lacking federal permission to set aggressive emission standards for the first time in almost 60 years, California may be left mainly with voluntary agreements with the auto, trucking and rail industries, and subsidies to entice consumers into buying electric vehicles.

Congress last month revoked the state’s authority to implement three landmark rules that ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and phase out diesel trucks. In addition, California was forced to abandon four other ambitious rules for zero-emission trucks, locomotives and commercial harbor craft because the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency would be unlikely to grant waivers.

Those seven mandates, now unenforceable, were key to cleaning up the pollutants that leave about 34 million Californians regularly breathing unhealthy air. In another blow to California’s efforts, Congress and President Donald Trump eliminated tax credits for consumers who buy electric cars.

At the same time, California’s air quality rules are facing growing pushback from the public, industry — and even some Democrats in the Legislature — because of the impacts on gas prices and other economic concerns.

Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, in an interview with CalMatters, did not offer any details on how the agency will make up for the voluminous tons of smog-causing gases and soot those rules would have eliminated.

“There’s no one strategy that’s going to work. It’s really going to need to be a suite of different things,” Randolph said. The governor and Legislature will help decide “what strategies are going to be the most effective, the most cost effective, the most likely to be able to scale up,” she said.

The air board is hosting four meetings in the coming weeks to hear ideas from industry groups, environmentalists and community members about how the state should now approach clean air regulation.

In an executive order last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom directed the air board to develop a new zero-emission car mandate — apparently in preparation for when the state either wins its lawsuit against Trump or when he leaves office.

Newsom also ordered the air board to develop a plan by Aug. 11 to keep expanding California’s market for electric cars and trucks. As part of the plan, the state agency must consider ways to improve charging infrastructure and offer incentives.

“We know that the federal government is going to be completely useless in our efforts to clean the air, despite rhetoric claiming they care about clean air. State and local governments are going to have to do more,” said Adrian Martinez, an attorney with the San Francisco-based environmental group Earthjustice.

“We just have to go it alone.”

Heart and lungs at stake

It’s been a long, bumpy road to cleaning up exhaust from California’s 36 million vehicles. Gas-powered cars and diesel trucks remain the state’s largest sources of smog and soot despite decades of cutting emissions.

Much of that pollution is inhaled by the most vulnerable Black and brown communities near ports, highways and warehouses. Ozone, a smog-causing gas, and fine particles of soot are linked to premature deaths from heart attacks and respiratory diseases, and increased emergency room visits.

For six decades, a provision in the Clean Air Act has granted California the power to set its own vehicle standards that are stricter than the federal government’s because of the state’s unique and severe air pollution problem.

But last month, Congress invoked the Congressional Review Act to repeal waivers granted by the Biden administration. The state in its lawsuit called this an unlawful action by Congress.

John Dunlap III, who served as California Air Resources Board chair under Gov. Pete Wilson in the 1990s, said in an interview with CalMatters that the Newsom administration “pushed too fast, and I think there were some holes” in their zero-emission car and truck rules.

Dunlap said by moving forward despite concerns about inadequate charging infrastructure, cost and the impacts on trucking, California regulators sent their critics straight into the arms of a more sympathetic federal government.

“They’ve been all in on zero-emission technology, which is great. It’s been a priority. But, they haven’t really cared to dialogue much, if at all, with the users of technology, particularly truck fleets,” he said. Dunlap was chair in 1996 when the board repealed deadlines requiring sales of electric cars because the technology wasn’t ready.

Under the landmark rule adopted by the air board in 2022, all new cars sold in California would have to be zero emissions beginning with 2035 models, ramping up from 68% in 2030. For trucks, California enacted two rules, one in 2020 and then one in 2023 that would phase out new diesel trucks by 2042. None will now be implemented.

Automakers say the rules were too aggressive and would have led to manufacturing job losses, higher car prices and limited consumer choices.

“The auto industry has invested billions in electrification and has 144 electrified models on the market right now. Again, the concerns were about the mandate – not the technology,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in a statement.

Conservatives say the air board is an unelected board that wields too much power. (Its members include appointees from Newsom and the Legislature, and local elected officials.) A Democrat in the Legislature last month urged Randolph, the board’s chair, to resign because the agency hasn’t analyzed the economic costs of its rules.

One new clean-air rule, the revamped Low Carbon Fuel Standard implemented last week, was met with widespread, vehement criticism from elected officials and industry since it will raise the price of gasoline by an unknown amount.

Amid concerns about the costs to consumers, the Trump administration and industry groups also are making it difficult for local agencies to take bold action.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District — responsible for regulating industrial plants and products that pollute the LA basin’s air — recently rejected rules phasing in zero-emission water heaters and furnaces.

The rules would have brought one of the biggest pollution reductions that the district has implemented in decades. But business groups and others were strongly opposed, saying fees imposed on manufacturers would raise the cost of products. And U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli threatened the local air district with a lawsuit if it approved the rule.

South Coast district Board Chair Vanessa Delgado and Executive Officer Wayne Nastri rejected multiple requests for interviews with CalMatters about what they plan to do next to clean the air in the LA basin.

“As you know, 80% of emissions in our region come from mobile sources — planes, trains, ships, heavy-duty trucks — all of which we do not have federal regulatory authority over,” said Nahal Mogharabi, spokesperson for the agency.

She directed all questions to Trump’s EPA.

What else can the state do?

Last month at the clean-vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Brett Ivy, a fleet manager for the aerospace company Northrop Grumman, wandered through Angel Stadium’s parking lot, looking at electric trucks and machines that he could potentially buy for his company.

Ivy knows the state isn’t enforcing its truck mandates, so he doesn’t know what his bosses will direct him to do in the future. He said they could abandon electric vehicles altogether.

But Ivy added, who knows what the next administration would bring, and Northrop Grumman has to think long-term. He wants to be prepared to do his job managing the company’s fleet of trucks.

“If we don’t, a new administration might reverse what (Trump) did,” he said. “Then you’re behind.”

The trucking industry, when the mandate was approved in 2023, predicted economic chaos and dysfunction and that it would “fail pretty spectacularly.” With its repeal, Nick Chiappe of the California Trucking Association expects that fleet owners will keep buying hydrogen and electric trucks when it makes economic sense, such as with smaller vehicles with shorter hauls.

“The industry will continue to work with (the air board) on reasonable steps to advance zero-emissions technology but maintain that the programs being rolled back were infeasible from the moment they were proposed,” Chiappe said.

Experts and advocates say California will have to approach clean air policy from many angles — mandates and incentives.

“There is still work that can be done,” said Martinez of Earthjustice. It’ll require “being creative and not losing steam,” he said. “These are big hits (from Trump) but I think still continuing to press on zero-emission vehicles is going to be really critical.”

Craig Segall, a former deputy executive officer for the state Air Resources Board, said the state should set new standards for cars and trucks. “The only thing that EPA is barred from doing is issuing substantially the same – not similar – waivers in the future,” he said. “The state can actually do quite a lot in terms of new standards.”

Segall said the state also should support companies that have already been buying zero-emission trucks with financing programs and get at the root of the transportation problem by expanding mass transit.

Offering incentives to consumers buying clean cars and trucks will be key. But Grundler, when asked whether California has the funds for more incentive programs, answered bluntly: No.

The state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, paid for by its cap and trade market program, typically has around $4 billion for programs related to climate change and air pollution. But because of the large deficit this year, the new budget allocated about $1.5 billion of those cap and trade funds to Cal Fire for fire prevention. It’s unclear how much will be left over for other projects.

In the state’s new budget, $132 million is allocated over the next fiscal year for an air board program offering incentives to truck fleet buyers.There also are creative ways that the state can encourage the purchase of electric cars, said Mary Nichols, the longtime chair of the air board under two previous governors and Newsom. Registration fees or sales taxes could be based on whether a car is gas-powered or electric, she said.

“The state of California has authority over everything relating to what cars can operate on our roads, as long as we’re not violating any constitutional requirements that deal with commerce between the states,” Nichols told CalMatters. “There’s a wide array of things that the state could do to make it clear that they don’t wish to continue having gasoline cars sold in the state of California.”

Tackling ‘pollution magnets‘

Experts say one of the most impactful policies the state could pursue without federal intervention could be regulating “pollution magnets.” These are hotspots, such as warehouses, ports and airports, that don’t directly pollute, but draw high-polluting vehicles, like diesel trucks and trains into communities.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District is developing a rule that would push the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports to install more charging stations for zero-emission trucks and cargo handling equipment. The district also approved a rule for warehouses that environmentalists call a success. These are known as “indirect source rules” since they regulate a place that is a hotspot.

These types of regulations “are definitely a leading strategy that California can continue to pursue environmental justice goals, despite the federal government being completely disinterested in environmental justice,” said Brennon Mendez, an environmental law and policy fellow at UCLA School of Law.

Polluting ports, airports and warehouses “should be held responsible for the air pollution that’s released into these neighborhoods because of their operations,” he said.

But while local air districts’ power to enact indirect source rules is well-established, the state’s power to do the same isn’t as clear.

A bill in the Legislature that enshrines the state’s power is opposed by labor and industry groups, especially now that the ports are facing economic uncertainty because of Trump’s tariffs. Assemblymember Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Rancho Cucamonga, said action on the bill is delayed until next year.

Also, a Senate bill would limit the South Coast district’s power to regulate the LA and Long Beach ports, requiring the agency to consider the costs and how ports and their tenants would be reimbursed, as well as the energy use and impacts on workers.

Randolph said it’s always been a struggle for California to slash enough emissions in California to achieve health standards, but now Trump’s actions “make the challenge even steeper and even harder.”

“The fundamental question,” she said, is “how do we continue to make progress…in the short-term and the long-term?”

The small Alaskan tribal village sits on permafrost, which is thawing fast as global temperatures rise. That’s left the banks of the Kugkaktlik River unstable — and more likely to collapse when floods hit, as they often do. Buildings, boardwalks, wind turbines and other critical infrastructure are at risk, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director.

So when the village learned late last year that it had been awarded a $20 million federal grant to protect the riverbank, tribal members breathed a sigh of relief.

But that relief was short-lived. On May 2, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency canceled the grant. Without that help, Paul says, residents may be forced to relocate their village.

“In the future, so much land will be in the river,” Paul says.

Kipnuk’s grant was one of more than 600 that the EPA has canceled since President Donald Trump took office, according to data obtained by Floodlight through a Freedom of Information Act request. Through May 15, the cuts totaled more than $2.7 billion.

Floodlight’s analysis of the data shows:

Environmental justice grants took by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4 billion in funding wiped out.

The EPA has also canceled more than $120 million in grants aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of cement, concrete and other construction materials. Floodlight reported in April that the cement industry’s carbon emissions rival those of some major countries — and that efforts to decarbonize the industry have lost momentum under the Trump administration.

Blue states bore the brunt. Those states lost nearly $1.6 billion in grant money — or about 57% of the funding cuts.

The single largest grant canceled: A $95 million award to the Research Triangle Institute, a North Carolina-based scientific research organization that had planned to distribute the money to underserved communities. RTI also lost five other EPA grants, totaling more than $36 million.

More cuts could be coming. The Washington Post reported in late April on a court filing that showed the EPA had targeted 781 grants issued under Biden. The data obtained by Floodlight shows the majority of those grants have already been canceled.

Lawsuit challenges grant cancellations

Two weeks ago, a coalition of nonprofits, tribes and local governments sued the EPA, alleging the Trump administration broke the law by canceling environmental and climate justice grants that Congress had already funded.

“Terminating these grant programs caused widespread harm and disruption to on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build community capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the nonprofits that filed the lawsuit. “We won’t let this stand.”

The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a written response to Floodlight, the agency said this about the grant cancellations:

“The Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission. The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in 2022 when it enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill. The program was designed to help the disadvantaged communities that are often hit hardest by pollution and climate change.

But on Jan. 20, Trump’s first day back in office, he signed an executive order halting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice, and canceling a Biden-era executive order that prioritized tackling environmental racism. Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government.

Underserved communities are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts such as heat waves and flooding because they have fewer resources to prepare or recover, according to a 2021 analysis by the EPA.

Inside the agency, not everyone agrees with the new direction. In a “declaration of dissent,” more than 200 current and former EPA employees spoke out against Trump administration policies, including the decision to dismantle the agency’s environmental justice program.

“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.

On Thursday, the EPA put 139 of the employees who signed the petition on administrative leave, Inside Climate News reported.

From hope to heartbreak in Texas

The people at Downwinders at Risk, a small Texas nonprofit that helps communities harmed by air pollution, thought they were finally getting a break.

Last year, they learned that the EPA had awarded them a $500,000 grant — enough to install nine new air quality monitors in working-class neighborhoods near asphalt shingle plants, a gas well and a fracking operation in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The data would have helped residents avoid the worst air and plan their days around pollution spikes.

But on May 1, the group’s three employees received the news they’d been dreading: Their grant had been canceled.

“It was a very bitter pill to swallow,” said Caleb Roberts, the group’s executive director.

He and his team had devoted more than 100 hours to the application and compliance process.

The nonprofit’s annual budget is just over $250,000, and the federal funding would have allowed the group to expand its reach after years of scraping by. They’d even paused fundraising for six months, confident the federal money was on the way.

“We feel like we're at ground zero again,” Roberts said. “And that's just very unfortunate.”

The model was one of seven new EVs planned for launch by 2030.

Honda is said to have cut a significant portion of its EV development budget to go toward hybrids.

Faced with the imminent crumbling of the federal tax credit and cooling EV demand in the United States, Honda has reportedly pulled the plug on its plan to launch a large (likely three-row) electric SUV. The model was expected to debut in 2027 as a rival to the Kia EV9, and it was one of the seven new fully electric models that Honda said it would launch by the end of the decade.

Nikkei quotes unnamed company insiders who confirmed the change of plan, which may include the cutting of additional planned EVs. While Honda seems primed to bring the 0 Series Saloon and 0 Series SUV to market, it's slowing down on additional models for now, such as this larger three-row SUV.

They say this is the result of a broader move by Honda to reduce EV development spending and shift funds toward hybrids instead. It's unclear whether the timing was coincidental or not, but this report emerged quickly after President Donald Trump signed his Big Beautiful Bill into law, which ends the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credits.

Regardless of timing, the source states that this U.S. policy shift regarding EVs and the general slowdown in demand played a big part in the decision. Losing the tax credit is expected to diminish EV demand in the U.S.

Honda is reportedly reducing its initially planned EV investment from $68.7 billion to $48.1 billion. The difference will go toward the development of new and improved hybrids, which have seen a surge in demand not only in the U.S. but also in Europe and other major markets. Honda is doing this to ensure the company’s profitability and to future-proof its business against fluctuating demand for pure electric vehicles.

While Honda hasn’t officially confirmed the news, it aligns with what other manufacturers have been doing over the past year. Most have backtracked on their lofty goals to go completely electric by the end of the decade or by 2035, after emphatically announcing that they were completely reevaluating their business and ditching combustion engines as soon as possible.

Last year, Ford also cancelled its plan to launch a large three-row electric SUV with a 350-mile range, which was supposed to arrive sometime this year. It initially announced that it was delaying its launch from 2025 until 2027, but then said it wasn’t coming at all. Just like Honda and others, Ford said it was reshuffling its resources to invest more in hybrid vehicle development.

It looks like combustion will stick around for much longer than previous plans suggested, especially in the U.S., where the demise of the EV tax credit is just one prong of a strong anti-EV movement within the government. The Trump administration has also moved to abolish California’s ZEV mandate (which planned to end the sale of pure combustion-powered vehicles by 2035). California and 10 other states are suing the federal government over the move.

Nobody wants a $70,000 electric behemoth when a midsize hybrid crossover does the same job for half the price, when there's a gas station on every corner, it seems. As good as vehicles like the Kia EV9 and others in its class are, and there are some fantastically fancy and capable large EV SUVs, it seems buyers aren’t snapping them up as the manufacturers would have hoped.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/y24Xbq/s1/honda-0-suv.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 09:15:19.170861

Raymond Zhong reports for The New York Times.

In short:

Warming air can hold more moisture, which means storms — especially in flood-prone areas like Central Texas — are dumping far more rain in shorter periods.

The Guadalupe River recently rose from three to 34 feet in 90 minutes, in a storm so rare it had a 0.1% chance of occurring in any given year.

While the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plans to update its rainfall predictions to reflect climate change, the Trump administration has cut key climate science positions, proposed gutting the research budget, and dismissed the hundreds of experts working on the 2028 edition of the National Climate Assessment, which helps local communities prepare for weather extremes.

Why this matters:

Warmer air holds more water, which means when it rains, it pours — especially in places like Central Texas, where dramatic terrain funnels water into towns, roads, and homes with terrifying speed. Rainfall prediction models are based on the past, not the present climate, and climate science funding keeps getting slashed. So as storms get stronger, our ability to prepare for them is weakening.

Inpassing President Trump’s budget bill Congressional Republicans last week ignored warnings that eliminating federal incentives for large-scale clean power and manufacturing projects could kill jobs and development in Red States. That outcome was expected, but is still a remarkable break historically with the tradition of politicians always trying to ensure they secure goodies for their districts–like big solar panel plants in Georgia or billion-dollar battery factories in Ohio and North Carolina.

The bill Trump signed into law on July 4 adds more than $3 trillion to the federal deficit, mainly by extending tax cuts for wealthy Americans and pumping up defense spending to $1 trillion. It also phases out tax credits for big wind and solar projects by next year and kills electric vehicle tax credits in September. At the same time, traditional fossil fuels, a top source of dangerous climate change, won new benefits in the legislation, including new access to drill in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, cheaper royalties to mine coal on federal land and new tax breaks for oil and gas drilling. It seems odd that such long-established industries, operating for well more than a century, still need the kind of government assistance now being denied to newer, more promising alternatives.

Energy analysts see the shift away from rapidly growing clean energy, the top source of new electricity generation in the U.S., as a risky move not only because it allows countries such as China to widen its dominance in producing batteries, electric cars, wind turbines and solar panels, but also because it’s likely to raise energy prices for Americans in the years to come. That’s because energy demand is rising quickly, but adding less wind and solar with battery storage to the grid, especially in the late 2020s as incentives vanish, ensures that utility rates will rise.

“This Trump energy tax will cost electricity customers billions of dollars in higher bills. Drivers will need to fill up more often at the pump. And costs for things like cleaner cars, solar energy and efficient air conditioners will skyrocket,” said Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. The bill will “bring the renaissance in American clean energy production to a halt and send good, domestic manufacturing jobs to our foreign rivals.”

Trump called his budget the “One Big Beautiful” bill. But given how damaging it could be for clean energy jobs and investment, it looks like a great leap backward for the U.S. energy sector.

The Big Read

Red States–And AI–Are Big Losers From Trump’s Clean Energy Massacre

President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act would cut the legs out from under the renewable energy industry.

The biggest hit: The bill would quickly phase out federal tax credits that have for years enabled wind and solar developers to offset 30% or more of project costs. Yes, it could have been even worse. At the last minute, the Senate’s Republican leadership ditched a proposed excise tax on wind and solar projects using Chinese components which could have added 20% to the cost of many projects. But it left in a fast phase-out of the tax credits.

Moreover, there are lots of other anti-green, pro-fossil fuel bullets the industry didn’t dodge. The bill would open more federal lands to oil and gas leasing at lower royalty rates; end tax credits and other subsidies for electric vehicles; and refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. There’s also a new tax break to incentivize mining metallurgical coal, now to be considered a strategic mineral.

Uncertainty, and the looming end of federally subsidized tax equity financing, could plunge renewables investing into a deep freeze, says Sandhya Ganapathy, CEO of Houston-based EDP Renewables North America (which operates wind and solar plants). “It severely hamstrings the U.S. ability to meet skyrocketing power demands and dilutes its economic competitiveness on the global stage,” she says.

Ironically, the impact will hit especially hard in Republican areas–a fact that Forbes (and others) thought last November might protect the industry from such savage cuts. A map (below) created by Michael Thomas, founder of Cleanview, shows that 78% of renewable energy projects underway are located in Red districts.

Hot Topic

Todd Khozein, CEO of global climate and social advisory firm SecondMuse, on the end of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act

The new budget bill makes dramatic changes, essentially ending the IRA. How do you assess the change?

We gave American innovation a fighting shot with the IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure. And we saw extraordinary progress, like the number of entrants into the long-duration energy storage field, the amount of investment that was going on, the investor enthusiasm, the coordination between grants from either the Department of Energy or the National Science Foundation.

This really gave the U.S. a shot to take a major share of the $270 trillion global climate transition. There's a major economic opportunity that the biggest economies in the world are all going after, and it feels like America is bowing out of it.

I think it's tragic because that's jobs. I feel like we've lost our way a little bit. We've gotten so focused on beating the other side politically that we've forgotten about this country. There's this extraordinary promise of America, that a bunch of people from a bunch of different places, where all of us are immigrants except for the indigenous communities here, have all been able to come together and build something pretty extraordinary.

We've kind of lost sight of that and gotten so wrapped up into one-upping things. We've forgotten that the way that you build things is by people working together. We don't need so much heat. Just tone it down. Let's work together and build something extraordinary. I think that we were on a path to doing that. Now it feels like taking a backseat.

What are the international implications?

Nobody's going to be cheering louder than China. This is a global market that we're choosing not to participate in. So we're not going to define it and we're not going to be able to have a seat at the table in the way we did before. The tragedy of this is that you have extraordinary American innovators that went to really good schools and are doing really well, and some of the most brilliant scientists.

We've lost the thread of what makes an economy great, what makes a country strong, what makes a society vibrant. I feel like this is a sign of where we've effectively dismantled something and haven't really put anything else in its place with this bill which, in my opinion, is tragic.

Do you see reasons to be optimistic about how the U.S. cleantech sector can contend with the shift in federal policy?

What I think is hopeful and what I see is 10 years ago there was effectively no climate tech market in New York. … We had a really clear state government leader and leadership that said, “this is our strategy and we're going to build this.” There was clear legislation, the Climate Leadership And Community Protection Act, the legislation said we're going to become leaders in climate tech. And when you go to New York Climate Week, New York has become one of the leading hubs of climate technology in the world. It was because we did things. So I feel like this is actually a really empowering story because it means that all you need is a consistent and sustained strategy.

If you have a consistent and sustained strategy from a government level and you have some mechanism to get people to come together, figure out what people's problems are and then target new legislation around the problems that are getting in the way of real entrepreneurs in a real way, this can happen at a local level. This can happen at the state level. If you do that, you will succeed. Did we rely on federal support to help the rest of our business? 100%. Did a lot of our entrepreneurs receive non-dilutive capital? 100%. But we got $430 million in the last two and a half years of private sector capital investing in these businesses. This was because of state mandates. The city and all of its real estate and all of its buildings use new climate technologies to make climate targets. You can do so much at the state level. That may be the thread of hope.

Coal Creek has historically sent its electricity directly to a converter station in Minnesota, where it then goes on the broader power grid.","BISMARCK — North Dakota’s largest coal plant could help power a new industrial park just a few years after financial issues almost led to the facility’s closure.

The McLean County Commission approved a request from Bismarck-based Rainbow Energy to convert the zoning classification of 800 acres of land near the plant — about 600 football fields — from agricultural to commercial in June.

The land, until recently, was owned by the Falkirk Mining Co., which supplies the coal to the plant, though this parcel has not been mined.

Rainbow owns Coal Creek Station, the 1,151-megawatt coal-fired power plant that would supply electricity to the industrial park.

The company’s plans for the area include building data centers with as much as 300 megawatts of electricity demand. Data centers are energy-hungry facilities that contain the physical infrastructure used for a variety of digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and cryptocurrencies. This new data center demand would be on top of an existing 200-megawatt data center that Rainbow directly powers at Coal Creek.

The industrial park is part of a broader effort that has been supported both rhetorically and financially by the North Dakota state government to keep the plant alive.

Coal Creek was built in the late 1970s and sent power to Minnesota for decades under the ownership of Great River Energy but had been losing money for years when the utility announced in 2020 that it planned to shutter the plant.

The 2020 announcement followed a trend in U.S. power markets where a large number of coal plants across the country had shut down as they struggled to compete with cheaper and more flexible forms of energy, such as natural gas and some sources of renewable energy. More stringent environmental regulations have also made operating coal plants more expensive.

State officials scrambled to find a buyer for the plant after Great River’s announcement.

In 2022, Rainbow Energy bought the station, along with the 436-mile-long Nexus Line, a valuable piece of infrastructure that sends electricity to the Twin Cities from McLean County.

Surging power demands — driven by the data center boom — along with efforts by the Trump administration to undo a broad swath of environmental regulations, could spell a somewhat rosier picture for coal-fired power on U.S. grid markets. Still, while lobbying for a coal plant tax break this spring, power company executives, including Rainbow’s, told North Dakota lawmakers that coal plants still face challenges.

If the effort to build an industrial park is fully seen through, area data centers would use just under half of the energy that the coal plant can produce, providing a steady, local customer for the fuel. That could insulate the plant from losing as much money as it has at times when it needs to cycle the amount of power it produces, which is more costly than running the plant at full capacity because of how it is designed.

Rainbow has also signed up to receive natural gas from Intensity Infrastructure Partners, which is one of the two companies seeking a financial guarantee from the North Dakota state government to build a gas pipeline stretching across the state.

Jessica Bell, Rainbow’s vice president of external affairs, said that gas generation is part of Rainbow’s plans for the data center park, but an overarching goal for the company remains to run Coal Creek at full capacity.

No project has been officially announced for the industrial park yet, said McLean County Land Use Administrator Todd Schreiner, but discussions around the data center projects are ongoing.

Schreiner said that any project Rainbow builds at the site will require a specific permit from the county. The zoning change agreement also includes stipulations that the county can deny projects without adequate fire protections or that require certain forms of waste disposal.

When Rainbow purchased the plant in 2022, officials spoke of multiple avenues beyond just data centers that could drive revenue back into the plant.

Rainbow does not operate like a traditional utility with ratepayers. Instead, it is an independent power producer that sells electricity to commercial businesses or public utilities. This setup makes the company subject to fewer regulations on what it can invest in. Some regulations may be harder to avoid, however.

Coal Creek has historically sent its electricity directly to a converter station in Minnesota, where it then goes on the broader power grid. It still does this through sales to some Minnesota utilities, but these companies are under a legal time clock to zero out their climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions by 2040.

North Dakota officials have argued that the law violates the Interstate Commerce Clause and indicated that they may sue over it, depending on how it is interpreted by Minnesota regulators. Still, the law’s presence spells another form of uncertainty for coal plants that send their power to grid infrastructure in the state.

To meet some of these challenges and drive money back into Coal Creek, Rainbow proposed capturing and storing the plant’s climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions underground in exchange for federal tax credits, as well as selling power from a new wind farm on Rainbow’s electric line that feeds into Minnesota.

Neither has gone into development as quickly as had been originally imagined.

Carbon capture, though technologically possible, has super high costs at power plants, and a project at a separate North Dakota coal plant has still not been constructed after at least a decade of study. Bell said Rainbow is still exploring the business case for carbon capture.

Plans to build what would have been North Dakota’s largest standalone wind project in the area floundered last year after local opposition brewed up and the McLean County State’s Attorney accused Apex Clean Energy, the project wind developer, of “creating divide-and-conquer dumpster fires” in its relations with the community.

Under Great River’s contract with Rainbow, it had planned to decrease its purchase of the coal-fired power to 350 megawatts this year as the wind farm was expected to come online and be off coal by 2031. Rainbow would have collected revenues from the wind power going on its electric line, which the company said would have been reinvested into Coal Creek.

Bell said there are still discussions regarding a new wind farm in the area, though there is nothing to announce at this time.

One effort that is moving forward is a project that converts coal waste into cement and other materials. That project was announced in 2023 and is expected to go online soon, Bell said.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/572b0bb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1803x1149+0+0/resize/1673x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F56%2Fcf%2Fbc7adda14bfd876ab58b0dfce220%2F070125-n-bt-coalcreek.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 10:08:34.987620

RTI also lost five other EPA grants, totaling more than $36m.
But on 20 January, Trump’s first day back in office, he signed an executive order halting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice.
“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.","This story was originally published by Floodlight

Acre by acre, the village of Kipnuk is falling into the river.

The small Alaska tribal village sits on permafrost, which is thawing fast as global temperatures rise. That’s left the banks of the Kugkaktlik River unstable – and more likely to collapse when floods hit, as they often do. Buildings, boardwalks, wind turbines and other critical infrastructure are at risk, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director.

So when the village learned late last year that it had been awarded a $20m federal grant to protect the riverbank, tribal members breathed a sigh of relief.

But that relief was short-lived. On 2 May, the US Environmental Protection Agency canceled the grant. Without that help, Paul says, residents may be forced to relocate their village.

“In the future, so much land will be in the river,” Paul says.

Kipnuk’s grant was one of more than 600 that the EPA has canceled since Donald Trump took office, according to data obtained by Floodlight through a Freedom of Information Act request. Through 15 May, the cuts totalled more than $2.7bn.

Floodlight’s analysis of the data shows:

Environmental justice grants took by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4bn in funding wiped out.

The EPA has also canceled more than $120m in grants aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of cement, concrete and other construction materials. Floodlight reported in April that the cement industry’s carbon emissions rival those of some major countries – and that efforts to decarbonize the industry have lost momentum under the Trump administration.

Blue states bore the brunt. Those states lost nearly $1.6bn in grant money – or about 57% of the funding cuts.

The single largest grant canceled: A $95m award to the Research Triangle Institute, a North Carolina-based scientific research organization that had planned to distribute the money to underserved communities. RTI also lost five other EPA grants, totaling more than $36m.

The EPA plans to cut even more grants, with the Washington Post reporting in late April on a court filing that showed it had targeted 781 grants issued under Biden.

The FOIA shows that the majority of these have now been canceled; more cuts could follow.

Lawsuit challenges grant cancellations

Last month, a coalition of nonprofits, tribes and local governments sued the EPA, alleging the Trump administration broke the law by canceling environmental and climate justice grants that Congress had already funded.

“Terminating these grant programs caused widespread harm and disruption to on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build community capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the nonprofits that filed the lawsuit. “We won’t let this stand.”

The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a written response to Floodlight, the agency said this about the grant cancellations: “The Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission. The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in 2022 when it enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill. The program was designed to help the disadvantaged communities that are often hit hardest by pollution and climate change.

But on 20 January, Trump’s first day back in office, he signed an executive order halting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice. Trump also cancelled Biden era executive orders that federal agencies prioritize tackling environmental racism, and separately in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government​.

Underserved communities are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts such as heatwaves and flooding because they have fewer resources to prepare or recover, according to a 2021 analysis by the EPA.

Inside the agency, not everyone agrees with the new direction. In a “declaration of dissent”, more than 200 current and former EPA employees spoke out against Trump administration policies, including the decision to dismantle the agency’s environmental justice program.

“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.

On Thursday, the EPA put 139 of the employees who signed the petition on administrative leave, Inside Climate News reported.

From hope to heartbreak in Texas

The people at Downwinders at Risk, a small Texas nonprofit that helps communities harmed by air pollution, thought they were finally getting a break.

Last year, they learned that the EPA had awarded them a $500,000 grant – enough to install nine new air quality monitors in working-class neighborhoods near asphalt shingle plants, a gas well and a fracking operation in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The data would have helped residents avoid the worst air and plan their days around pollution spikes.

But on 1 May, the group’s three employees received the news they’d been dreading: Their grant had been canceled.

“It was a very bitter pill to swallow,” said Caleb Roberts, the group’s executive director.

He and his team had devoted more than 100 hours to the application and compliance process.

The nonprofit’s annual budget is just over $250,000, and the federal funding would have allowed the group to expand its reach after years of scraping by. They’d even paused fundraising for six months, confident the federal money was on the way.

“We feel like we’re at ground zero again,” Roberts said. “And that’s just very unfortunate.”

In a statement published Friday, Clean Energy Canada gave three recommendations to the federal government to help deliver affordable EVs to Canadians for less than $40,000.

The group, based out of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said Ottawa should retool its EV mandate by revisiting its near-term targets to help the auto sector “weather this temporary storm” of slumping EV sales.

“Any additional flexibility added in the regulation should be designed to achieve other EV-related goals, such as delivering more affordable EVs and building out Canada’s charging network,” says the statement by executive director Rachel Doran and director of public affairs Joanna Kyriazis.

The plea comes on the heels of auto manufacturing leaders meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney last week, in which the CEOs repeated their calls for the mandate to be repealed.

Starting next year, the mandate would require 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada to be zero-emission vehicles. Those also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The target rises annually to 100 per cent by 2035.

Recent data from Statistics Canada suggests EVs accounted for 7.53 per cent of all new vehicles sold in April.

Following the meeting, the head of an organization representing Ford Canada, GM Canada and Stellantis said he was “cautiously optimistic” the government would take action on the mandate.

Clean Energy Canada also called on Ottawa to re-fund the EV incentive program, but to be clearer as to when the program will be phased out.

The government launched the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program in 2019, which gave car buyers up to $5,000 toward the cost of an electric vehicle. The program was abruptly suspended back in January when its funding ran out.

It has left many dealerships on the hook for the rebate if they hadn’t already sent in their claim before the program ended. The federal government put nearly $3 billion into the program during its lifespan.

“The rebate should start at $5,000 and decline by $1,000 each year, providing consumers and automakers with a well-communicated phaseout that avoids periods of artificially lowered EV sales as buyers await the return of rebates or at least clarity,” Clean Energy Canada says.

A similar policy is in place in Quebec.

Federal ministers have said in recent months that the government was working toward bringing back consumer incentives on EVs.

Those promises faced criticism from automakers themselves because, without implementing a rebate, EV sales are slumping further, as buyers wait for the rebates to come back.

Clean Energy Canada also called on the federal government to reconsider its approach to cheaper EVs from China, which are subject to a 100 per cent tariff which took effect in October. Ottawa is scheduled to review the measure later this year.

“Allowing in a limited quota of these affordable vehicles while also recognizing EU-approved vehicles … would open Canada’s vehicle market to fill important market gaps, drive innovation and ultimately make our auto sector more competitive,” the group says.

(Nasdaq: FCEL) President and CEO Jason Few has issued a statement praising the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) for its direct support of the fuel cell industry and its role in strengthening America’s energy infrastructure, data center resilience, and clean manufacturing base.

“The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ is a landmark for American energy leadership—and it’s time to set the record straight: clean energy was not sidelined,” said Few. “In fact, the bill includes direct, powerful provisions that support the fuel cell industry and reinforce the United States’ position as a global leader in data center infrastructure and grid resilience.”

Few highlighted the reinstatement of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) as a key win for the sector. He also emphasized the importance of preserving the transferability of federal tax credits, calling it “very important—especially for small- and mid-sized companies—to maintain the ability to monetize these credits.”

FuelCell Energy also expressed support for Congress’ decision to modify hydrogen provisions in the bill, ensuring stability for companies that have already made significant investments in hydrogen.

“Supporters of the OBBBA deserve credit for moving the conversation toward a more inclusive, American-built and led, innovation-driven—and yes, clean—energy policy,” Few concluded.

Full Statement from Jason Few, President & CEO of FuelCell Energy

“The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ is a landmark for American energy leadership—and it’s time to set the record straight: clean energy was not sidelined. In fact, the bill includes direct, powerful provisions that support the fuel cell industry and reinforce the United States’ position as a global leader in data center infrastructure and grid resilience.

One of the most impactful elements of the legislation is the reinstatement of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC). By maintaining full ITC eligibility for fuel cell technologies, the bill ensures that companies like FuelCell Energy can continue to deploy U.S.-built platforms at scale. This is not just about clean energy—it’s about national competitiveness, energy security, and the infrastructure backbone of the AI economy.

The ITC’s flexibility—especially its transferability and long-term visibility—gives developers and investors the confidence to accelerate deployment. That means more resilient power for data centers, more stable grids in the face of extreme weather, and more American jobs in advanced manufacturing.

We especially applaud Congress’ decision to preserve the transferability of key federal tax credits. It’s particularly important for small- and mid-sized companies to maintain the ability to monetize these credits. That flexibility facilitates the financing they need to grow. If a mid-size, highly specialized manufacturer can go from one full-time production shift to two or even three, that’s more U.S. jobs and faster deployment of power solutions.

In addition, we support Congress’ decision to modify the hydrogen provisions in the OBBBA. We recognize that many companies have made significant investments in hydrogen. Congress made the right call in ensuring that those investments are not undermined by sudden policy shifts. That kind of stability is essential for long-term innovation.

Let’s be clear: the OBBBA doesn’t pick winners and losers—it recognizes the unique strengths of each clean energy technology. Fuel cells are dispatchable, scalable, and built for the demands of a digital, electrified future. This bill gives us the tools to lead.

We appreciate all the work that has been done in the House and Senate on behalf of the energy sector, and we believe the supporters of the OBBBA deserve credit for moving the conversation toward a more inclusive, American-built and led, innovation-driven—and yes, clean—energy policy.”

The Gulf Coast is no longer just a refining hub—it's a geopolitical and logistical chessboard.","The U.S. Gulf Coast, the beating heart of North American refining, faces an energy crossroads. Declining Latin American crude imports, rising geopolitical risks, and the scramble to adapt refineries to heavier feedstocks are reshaping the energy landscape. For investors, this volatility creates both peril and opportunity. Let's dissect the risks, the shifting dependencies, and the companies poised to profit—or falter—in this new era.

The Decline of Latin American Crude Imports: A Perfect Storm

Latin America's once-dominant role in supplying the Gulf Coast is unraveling. Mexico and Venezuela, once providers of 1.3 million barrels per day (b/d) combined, now face annual net export declines exceeding -32% since 2007 (per the Export Land Model). Key drivers include:

- Production Slumps: Mexico's output has dropped 40% since 2004, while Venezuela's PDVSA struggles with underinvestment and sanctions.

- Canadian Competition: Canadian oil sands now supply 2.9 million b/d to the U.S., outcompeting Latin American heavy crude on cost and reliability.

- Asian Pivot: Latin American producers like Venezuela and Colombia are redirecting exports to Asia, where demand for heavy crude is rising and transit times are less critical.

The result? Gulf Coast refineries, which relied on 5-day transits from Mexico/Venezuela, now face a 30-day wait for Middle Eastern crude. This logistical strain became stark in 2025, as inventories fell by 15.6 million barrels in just two weeks, amplifying price volatility.

Refinery Specialization and Supply Chain Pressures

The Gulf Coast's refineries are uniquely designed to process heavy, sour crude, a niche that has become both a strength and a vulnerability.

Opportunities for Heavy Crude Producers:

- Canadian Oil Sands: Companies like Cenovus Energy (CVE) and Suncor (SU) benefit as Gulf refiners pivot northward. Their output is ideal for the region's cokers and hydrocrackers.

- Alaskan Crude: The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) is seeing renewed demand. Alaska's heavy, high-sulfur crude complements Gulf Coast infrastructure, with Hilcorp Energy (private but influential) leading production.

Risks in the Supply Chain:

- Logistical Bottlenecks: The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) is nearing capacity, while pipeline constraints limit Canadian crude's eastward flow.

- Weather Risks: Hurricane season threatens refineries and ports, compounding supply disruptions.

Geopolitical Risks Amplifying Uncertainty

The energy equation is now inextricably tied to geopolitics:

1. Venezuelan Sanctions: The loss of Venezuelan crude (zero exports to the U.S. since early 2025) has left a void. PDVSA's focus on servicing Citgo refineries leaves little flexibility.

2. China's Influence: Beijing's $50+ billion in loans to Venezuela complicates U.S.-Latin American relations, while Chinese refiners are shifting to Brazilian and West African crude, further sidelining the U.S.

3. U.S. Policy Uncertainty: Proposed tariffs on Canadian and Mexican crude could force Gulf refiners to rely even more on distant suppliers, raising costs.

Investment Opportunities: Diversify or Perish

The path forward demands investments in resilience and flexibility:

1. Energy Infrastructure Plays:

- Plains All American Pipeline (PAA): Operates key Gulf Coast terminals and pipelines, critical for moving Canadian and Alaskan crude.

- Enterprise Products Partners (EPD): Specializes in midstream logistics for heavy hydrocarbons.

2. Heavy Crude Producers with Scale:

- Cenovus Energy (CVE): Low-cost oil sands operator with a 2025 production target of 350,000 b/d.

- Alaska's Hilcorp: Expected to boost output to 500,000 b/d by 2030 via TAPS upgrades.

3. Refiners with Flexible Feedstocks:

- Valero (VLO): Dominates Gulf Coast refining and has invested in coker upgrades to handle heavier crudes.

- Marathon Petroleum (MPC): Diversified into petrochemicals, reducing reliance on crude margins.

Risks to Monitor

Refining Margin Collapse: Narrowing cracks (the difference between crude cost and product prices) could hit refiners like Tesoro (TSO) hard.

Geopolitical Flashpoints: Conflict over the Taiwan Strait or Middle East tensions could spike crude prices, hurting demand.

Conclusion: Build a Portfolio for Chaos

The Gulf Coast's energy future hinges on two truths: adaptation and diversification. Investors should:

1. Favor Infrastructure: Midstream firms like PAA and EPD are critical to moving crude to refineries.

2. Back Heavy Crude Producers: Canadian and Alaskan assets will fill the Latin American void.

3. Avoid Rigid Refiners: Companies unable to process multiple feedstocks face obsolescence.

The Gulf Coast is no longer just a refining hub—it's a geopolitical and logistical chessboard. Stay nimble, and let the data guide you.

Synchronized Swimming And just as bad, if not worse, than the intensity of the new power demand?
There was a lot of activity, but it nonetheless tended to balance out to an average power demand.
In other words, the synchronous work of AI data centers creates significant and sudden swings in energy demand.
“There are a number of ways of attacking [stabilizing energy usage at data centers],” Sisto said.","Still, Silicon Valley is behind much of the new power demand. A report from the International Energy Agency published last year found that data center energy consumption is expected to double by 2030, accounting for roughly 9% of all power demand on the US grid.

Synchronized Swimming

And just as bad, if not worse, than the intensity of the new power demand? The complexity of the new data centers. Or rather, lack thereof. In the past decade, the typical cloud-computing data centers powered all sorts of digital activities, with some pockets of servers beaming Netflix shows into living rooms, others connecting users to email, and still more powering games of Fortnite. There was a lot of activity, but it nonetheless tended to balance out to an average power demand.

On the other hand, new age AI-powering data centers — particularly those using massive chipsets to train AI models — operate in a “synchronous work” capacity, moving and demanding power as one unit through different processes.

“What happens is they may hit a point in the code where it’s like, ‘Stop for a check-in,’ and then all 100,000 chips go to zero [power demand] all at once for a 20-millisecond check-in on the line of code,” Sisto told The Daily Upside. In other words, the synchronous work of AI data centers creates significant and sudden swings in energy demand. That’s not great for the old US grid.

“The behavior of data centers has the potential to cause cascading power outages for an entire region,” Alison Silverstein, a former senior adviser to the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, recently told Reuters.

A Reuters report from March analyzing disclosure filings by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Lone Star State’s main grid operator, found more than 30 near-miss blackout incidents since 2020 triggered by data centers and crypto mines suddenly switching offline.

The increasing number of data centers coming online is a major reason why the North American Electric Reliability Corp., an international regulator working to reduce risks to grid reliability, stated in a recent report that nearly all of the US will face an increased risk of energy shortfalls over the next five to 10 years.

System Shock

Which means it’s just as important for data centers to find ways to stabilize the ways they’re using power — establishing what Sisto calls “shock absorbers” for energy usage — as it is for them to access more power.

“There are a number of ways of attacking [stabilizing energy usage at data centers],” Sisto said. “None of them are the silver bullet. It’s going to be a combination of things.”

One major component of that will likely be batteries, which help data centers smooth out their grid-rattling energy usage patterns.

Tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have helped accelerate growth in the energy storage industry. A 2023 report from McKinsey estimated the battery energy storage systems market will reach $150 billion in value by 2030, more than double its size in 2023. That includes startups such as XL Batteries, as well as major players like Tesla, Panasonic, General Electric and, who could forget, NRG Energy.

Virtual (Power Plant) Reality: The grid modernization effort hardly stops there. Significant innovation gains, such as the rise of “virtual power plants” (VPPs), are creating newfound avenues for efficiency. In short, VPPs enable the decentralized, distributed nature of modern energy grids — where power can come from solar, wind, batteries, and other resources simultaneously — to act as a single, coordinated source, much like a traditional power plant of the past.

VPPs can then act in unison with individual customers, be it commercial businesses or homes (by connecting virtually with everything from thermostats to home appliances), to efficiently increase and decrease power supply in accordance with surging demand. For example, instead of local municipalities blast-texting residents to turn off the AC during peak hours of a heat wave to avoid a blackout, VPPs can effectively fine-tune scores of thermostats at once to ease the overall burden on the grid.

Such coordinated demand-side flexibility can curb demand from less vital sources to prevent major blackouts while maintaining critical functions — like keeping the lights on at the hospital — in the process.

“Instead of having to use the very blunt tool of shutting off a whole neighborhood, we can make small adjustments to thermostats,” Paul Hines, vice president of power systems at VPP software company EnergyHub, told The Daily Upside.

In a recent LinkedIn post, EnergyHub said that by utilizing such VPP efficiency tools, the company was able to help local grids reduce their energy load by about 900 megawatts during last week’s heat dome, which Hines compared to about “​​a good-sized nuclear power plant’s worth of power that was reduced.”

It’s just another tool that may soon become the new normal of grid modernization — to avoid what could be a less pleasant new normal of frequent blackouts and unreliable power.

“We see bridges crumbling, and we see roads that struggle and need to be worked on. But the grid is kind of silent in that regard, right?” Sisto said. “You turn the lights on and they turn on. Your fridge always works, and that’s the way it should be. So I think that’s kind of where it’s an interesting thing that you don’t notice until it’s a problem. And so getting in front of that is something I think that is really important.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ItHZpiI6_ro_hHt8beJULA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_daily_upside_435/74ab896ccd61715bc7fc20ed265348fa,N,,2025-07-07 10:08:43.855724

On July 7, 2025, LG Energy Solutions announced a 152% increase in its quarterly operating profit. They explained that their operating profit is 492 billion won in Q2, which is much more than the 192 billion won profit a year earlier. A 142 billion won profit without the U.S. tax credits shows a deep structural strength.

LG Energy Solutions is one of the world’s biggest lithium-ion battery manufacturers South Korean Company. It specializes in making batteries for electric vehicles, energy storage systems, and consumer electronics.

Today, LGES is considered a global leader in EV battery tech, competing with Chinese giant CATL, Japan’s Panasonic, and fellow Korean firms like Samsung SDI and SK On.

During late 2023 and early 2024, LG Energy Solution went through a tough phase. The demand for electric vehicles decreased due to changes in the U.S. tariffs and subsidies. Companies’ orders also decreased, and they couldn’t cover their expenses.

In Q4 of 2024, LGES lost 226 billion won (around $170 million USD) in just three months, for the first time losing money from operations since 2021. Because of this big loss, they cut their capital expenditures by 30%. That means they decided to spend less on new projects, factories, or upgrades in order to save money. Then, again in Q1 of 2025, the company has seen a 138% rise in its quarterly operating profit, but due to tax credits under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and it faces a loss of 83 billion won ($56.52 million).

What’s Driving the H2 Turnaround

One of the biggest reasons behind LG’s resurgence is its localization strategy in North America. The company has been expanding its manufacturing areas across Michigan, Tennessee, and Ohio to qualify for U.S. subsidies and reduce logistics costs.

One of its major steps towards progress was the launch of a new LFP battery plant in Holland, Michigan, which is dedicated to energy storage systems with a capacity of 16.5 GWh combined with 5GWh; the site has a total capacity of 21GWh. This step improved their cost efficiency and positioned them as a competitor in the ESS supply.

Alongside localization, they are also working on the mass production of LFP batteries by advancing their 46-series cylindrical cells, which are more efficient and lighter.

Recently, the company secured a long-term supply deal with Chery Auto, which aims to cover 8 GWh over six years. That’s enough to power approximately 120,000 electric vehicles. The exact amount of the contract has not been disclosed, but observations show it can exceed 1 trillion won ($734 million).

Kim Dong-myung, CEO of LG Energy Solution, said,

“This deal marks a pivotal step in scaling up global adoption of our new 46-series batteries and securing a dominant market leadership.”

Finally, LGES has shown a profit without relying solely on these subsidies, while the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, especially the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPC), have supported the rebound. This combination of regional production and strategic incentives has driven the company’s growth in the second quarter of 2025.

The periods when LGES shows significant growth, its rivals, SDI and SK On, are stuck in a downturn. In Q2, SDI is expected to post over 200 billion won in operating loss, and SK On may lose around 100 billion won.

The key reason for LGES’ growth lies in its LFP battery installations and localization in North America. In contrast, Samsung SDI and SK On have lagged behind in LFP battery strategies and localization efforts, making it harder for them to recover in the current market.

Whether this rebound becomes a long-term lead will depend on how well LGES adapts to a fast-evolving battery market, where innovation, regional independence, and political agility now matter as much as product quality.",https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-07-South-Koreas-LG-Energy-Solution-says-Q2-profit-likely-up-152-on-year-techi@2x-984x492.webp,N,,2025-07-07 11:25:13.118826

(Nasdaq: FCEL) President and CEO Jason Few has issued a statement praising the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) for its direct support of the fuel cell industry and its role in strengthening America’s energy infrastructure, data center resilience, and clean manufacturing base.

“The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ is a landmark for American energy leadership—and it’s time to set the record straight: clean energy was not sidelined,” said Few. “In fact, the bill includes direct, powerful provisions that support the fuel cell industry and reinforce the United States’ position as a global leader in data center infrastructure and grid resilience.”

Few highlighted the reinstatement of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) as a key win for the sector. He also emphasized the importance of preserving the transferability of federal tax credits, calling it “very important—especially for small- and mid-sized companies—to maintain the ability to monetize these credits.”

FuelCell Energy also expressed support for Congress’ decision to modify hydrogen provisions in the bill, ensuring stability for companies that have already made significant investments in hydrogen.

“Supporters of the OBBBA deserve credit for moving the conversation toward a more inclusive, American-built and led, innovation-driven—and yes, clean—energy policy,” Few concluded.

Full Statement from Jason Few, President & CEO of FuelCell Energy

“The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ is a landmark for American energy leadership—and it’s time to set the record straight: clean energy was not sidelined. In fact, the bill includes direct, powerful provisions that support the fuel cell industry and reinforce the United States’ position as a global leader in data center infrastructure and grid resilience.

One of the most impactful elements of the legislation is the reinstatement of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC). By maintaining full ITC eligibility for fuel cell technologies, the bill ensures that companies like FuelCell Energy can continue to deploy U.S.-built platforms at scale. This is not just about clean energy—it’s about national competitiveness, energy security, and the infrastructure backbone of the AI economy.

The ITC’s flexibility—especially its transferability and long-term visibility—gives developers and investors the confidence to accelerate deployment. That means more resilient power for data centers, more stable grids in the face of extreme weather, and more American jobs in advanced manufacturing.

We especially applaud Congress’ decision to preserve the transferability of key federal tax credits. It’s particularly important for small- and mid-sized companies to maintain the ability to monetize these credits. That flexibility facilitates the financing they need to grow. If a mid-size, highly specialized manufacturer can go from one full-time production shift to two or even three, that’s more U.S. jobs and faster deployment of power solutions.

In addition, we support Congress’ decision to modify the hydrogen provisions in the OBBBA. We recognize that many companies have made significant investments in hydrogen. Congress made the right call in ensuring that those investments are not undermined by sudden policy shifts. That kind of stability is essential for long-term innovation.

Let’s be clear: the OBBBA doesn’t pick winners and losers—it recognizes the unique strengths of each clean energy technology. Fuel cells are dispatchable, scalable, and built for the demands of a digital, electrified future. This bill gives us the tools to lead.

We appreciate all the work that has been done in the House and Senate on behalf of the energy sector, and we believe the supporters of the OBBBA deserve credit for moving the conversation toward a more inclusive, American-built and led, innovation-driven—and yes, clean—energy policy.”

But who will reap its benefits?,Bridgett Ennis,,,,,https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/07/a-climate-solution-lies-a-mile-underground-but-who-will-reap-its-benefits/,"A vast amount of a metal that is critical for manufacturing climate-friendly technologies lies in reservoirs about a mile below the ground in the southern Imperial Valley, California.
That’s good news for Imperial Valley, a region burdened by environmental degradation, poverty, and labor exploitation.
Local community actors are fighting for mandatory community benefits agreements that would require local hiring.
You’ve got an Imperial Valley renamed Lithium Valley, a really critical mineral.
So what is happening in Imperial Valley will not stay in Imperial Valley.","A vast amount of a metal that is critical for manufacturing climate-friendly technologies lies in reservoirs about a mile below the ground in the southern Imperial Valley, California.

It’s contained in a substance called superheated geothermal brine. In plain English: extremely hot, salty water.

The brine has been used for decades at 11 geothermal power plants, which bring the brine to the surface via wells and then create steam that turns turbines, generating electricity.

But developers are now eying the brine for an additional use: The superheated liquid contains an estimated 15 million metric tons of lithium, a silvery-white metal used in batteries. There’s enough of it dissolved in the brine to electrify the entire U.S. auto fleet and still have some left over for making batteries to store renewable energy.

Traditional lithium extraction methods – which involve either mining or flooding deserts with water – are controversial because they can destroy habitats and pollute water. Extracting it instead from brine could better protect the environment, proponents say.

That’s good news for Imperial Valley, a region burdened by environmental degradation, poverty, and labor exploitation. The community is rebranding itself as “Lithium Valley,” and residents are working to ensure the new industry will boost the local economy with investment and good jobs.

Manuel Pastor, the director of the Equity Research Institute at the University of Southern California, says the lithium industry has the potential to benefit the community. But he cautions that it will require a lot of work.

“Good outcomes don’t just come from good wishes, they come from hardheaded strategies,” Pastor says.

Yale Climate Connections spoke with Pastor about why Lithium Valley is a promising spot for environmentally friendly lithium mining, and how the community could maximize the local economic impact and achieve a just transition to a cleaner economy.

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Yale Climate Connections: How were the lithium deposits in Imperial County discovered?

Manuel Pastor: There are three methods of extracting lithium. One is hard rock mining. It’s practiced in Australia and other places. It’s quite environmentally destructive, as hard rock mining usually is.

The second is evaporation ponds, which involve basically flooding deserts with water, surfacing lithium if it’s in the sand, and extracting it as the water recedes. That’s very environmentally wasteful with regard to water.

The third method of extracting lithium is what’s called direct lithium extraction. It promises to be the cleanest, greenest method of extracting lithium. It involves going down beneath the surface to geothermal reserves that might be rich in lithium, bringing them to the surface as brine – salty water – extracting the minerals from the brine, and then using this hot water to generate electricity, which can help with the extraction, and then injecting the water back into the reserves.

There’s only three places in the world where it seems like there’s geothermal reserves that are rich enough in lithium for this to be commercially viable, and Imperial Valley, which is now being renamed Lithium Valley, is one of them.

While this method of lithium extraction has long been thought to be theoretically viable, whether or not it’s commercially viable has been uncertain. It’s just over the last few years that a company operating in Imperial Valley has demonstrated that there’s a commercially viable way of doing this. And so it’s quite possible that this area is on the precipice of a major boom that could bring significant economic activity.

But whether or not it actually benefits the residents, gives them jobs, that the resources get plowed in to clean up other environmental problems, that the extraction doesn’t have a lot of leakage of minerals, all of that is much more uncertain.

YCC: What are some of the concrete steps that must be taken to make sure that people and local communities are helped and not harmed by tapping into this resource?

Pastor: Imperial County is a site of tremendous labor exploitation, long reliant on agriculture with low wages and difficult working conditions, often with migrant workers who come from Mexicali. It’s a place of tremendous racialized distribution of power – it’s a county that’s 85% Latino, but the Latino community is close to poverty and far from power in terms of making decisions.

And it’s the site of enough lithium to redo the entire American auto fleet to electricity and have 100 million batteries left over. It’s important in and of itself, but it’s this huge stage for what’s going to happen in our new economy if we move in a direction of clean energy. It will also be a direction that repairs not just the environmental damage of the past but the social damage of the past and the present.

One of the things that is crucial is making sure that the lithium extraction jobs go to people who live in the community. Local community actors are fighting for mandatory community benefits agreements that would require local hiring. The local community college is working to train people for the jobs that will be there in plant maintenance, operations, and construction. And those are all important steps.

The other set of important steps has to do with understanding that there are actually very few jobs in lithium extraction and that there are more employment possibilities the further you move up the supply chain. So when you move to battery assembly, more jobs. When you move to EV assembly, even more jobs. Battery recycling, there are jobs there as well. So one of the important things will be whether or not the county, the companies, and communities can actually attract other parts of the supply chain, like battery assembly and maybe even EV assembly – if not in Imperial County itself, nearby – because that will make the lithium from Imperial Valley and batteries, if they’re produced there, even more attractive because of the reduction in transportation costs.

So getting the benefits that people want is going to require an interesting combination of community power building – people show up at the table with sufficient power to force concessions – but also with economic expertise to be able to understand the supply chain and generate the maximum benefits.

There’s a bit of an analogy to what the autoworkers did during the 1930s. They mastered the sit-down strike, where autoworkers actually just sat down and occupied plants – they seized the means of production, built power, and forced the companies to the negotiating table. But they followed the sit-down strike with sitting down at that table and negotiating what would make the auto industry viable and yield maximum wages and benefits for the workers who operated in it. And that set the contours for a postwar social compact, not just within auto, but within manufacturing generally in the United States – a sort of golden era in which our economy grew, the companies did well, and workers’ wages rose in tandem with their productivity. Getting back to that set of arrangements is once again going to require community power-building and economic expertise.

YCC: Do you feel optimistic and have hope that the positive outcomes you describe are achievable in the amount of time people have?

Pastor: I’m always optimistic, but hope is not about foolish imagination. It’s about understanding the terrain ahead and making calculated moves to make dreams come real. The way community-based organizations have been learning about the industry, working with labor unions and national groups to think through community benefits, particularly in a new formation called Valle Unido or Valley United for Community Benefits, I think that is a calculated strategy – that gives me hope.

The fact that these companies have begun to realize that in order to do well, everybody in that region needs to do well gives me hope. The fact that community officials have acquired enough knowledge to be involved in active bargaining with the corporations – and not simply trying to bring them to the table with the lowest possible taxes – gives me hope.

One of the things that was very important was seeing community groups and county officials team up to lobby the state of California for an excise tax on lithium that is supposed to benefit the most distressed communities and will disproportionately go to Imperial County. There’s some dispute about whether it will really do that, but the fact that they’ve done that work and then set aside some of the tax for remediation of the Salton Sea – this toxic body of water that needs not just our love, but our dollars – that gives me hope that people are thinking about the future in a realistic way. But it’s going to require a lot of work. Good outcomes don’t just come from good wishes; they come from hardheaded strategies.

If this is successful, it will be a set of lessons, not just for one particular location, but for all the questions surrounding just transition. You’ve got an Imperial Valley renamed Lithium Valley, a really critical mineral. You’ve got environmentalists excited because it’s clean and green. You’ve got corporations excited because of the dollars they see in the future. You’ve got local officials excited because economic development could take place. You’ve got communities that are wary because they’ve often been subject to false promises, but they’re trying to figure out how to get the most benefits from it.

And that is really the whole set of actors that are involved in our movement to a clean energy economy. Environmental forces, companies that may have good intentions – but are mostly motivated by the money that they can make, government, which needs to provide the guardrails, and community and labor forces that are trying to make sure that a transition is not only clean, but just as well. So what is happening in Imperial Valley will not stay in Imperial Valley. The lessons are crucial for just transition in multiple locations.",https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250707-SaltonSeaArielFromSouth.jpg?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-07 10:08:47.156818

Already one of India’s most valuable companies, with a market worth exceeding $240 billion, Reliance is entering a new phase of growth, driven by long-term investments across energy transition technologies and next-generation digital infrastructure. The company, led by Mukesh Ambani, is laying the foundation for what it sees as its most transformative ventures to date.

According to Morgan Stanley’s latest report, Reliance’s new energy initiatives — particularly its plan to generate, store, and utilize renewable electricity across verticals like refining, chemicals, and data centers — could alone contribute up to $60 billion in value over time. These efforts are part of a larger strategy to future-proof the business and align with global shifts toward sustainable and digital economies.

A key part of this strategy is the integration of Generative AI (Gen AI) into Reliance’s operations. The company is upgrading its massive Jamnagar facility to become a hub for AI computing, where clean energy will directly power data centers and high-performance computing infrastructure. The site will eventually host 1GW of data center capacity, supported by approximately 1.3GW of continuous green energy.

To make this possible, Reliance is rapidly expanding its renewable energy footprint. It has begun manufacturing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries and is moving forward with green hydrogen production, all anchored around a 2,000-acre clean energy complex in Gujarat.

These efforts will be crucial to supplying uninterrupted power to data infrastructure — a growing global challenge in scaling AI technologies. By the end of 2026, Reliance aims to install 10 gigawatts of solar power, a milestone that will help support its AI and digital operations while advancing India’s positioning as a competitive data center destination on the global map.

Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.

The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.

“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”

Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.

House, Senate push along bills to attract nuclear developments to Indiana

In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”

The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.

Lawmakers passed legislation easing the path to nuclear and Gov. Mike Braun has indicated his strong support.

But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.

“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.

In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.

In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.

Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.

Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.

“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”

But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.

“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”

Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.

“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”

Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.

Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.

Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”

The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.

The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.

The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.

“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”

Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.

‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.

Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?

“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”

Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.

“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”

Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.

“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nuclear-three-mile-island.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:26:12.985045

Located next to the approved Three Oaks solar farm and battery storage system between Thornholme and Haisthorpe in the East Riding, this project would create a hybrid renewable energy park.

The Three Oaks Renewable Energy Park Extension would see a 25.2MW wind farm co-located alongside the solar and battery site.

RCE says its new proposal aligns with the Government’s Clean Power 2030 Action Plan to develop homegrown energy that will reduce household bills, ensure the UK is energy independent, and make more efficient use of existing grid infrastructure.

Subject to planning permission, the wind turbines could be operational before 2030, generating as much clean electricity each year as is used by over 24,000 homes.

This project is among the first onshore wind developments to move forward in England following the July 2024 removal of the de facto national ban on onshore wind.

If approved, it would unlock a community benefit fund of £126,000 per year, equating to over £5 million over 40 years, including over £100,000 annually in local energy discounts for households near the site.

Much of this funding would be delivered to households nearest the project, who would receive over £1,000 per year towards their electricity bills, with further funding available for residential properties within 3km of the turbines.

RCE chief executive Marjorie Glasgow said: “We have greatly enjoyed working with the communities of Burton Agnes and Thornholme, and by adding turbines to the already-consented solar project, we know we can do so much more locally.

“By integrating wind and solar at the Three Oaks site, we are not only responding to the renewed political support for onshore wind. This extension represents a meaningful step toward carbon reduction and ensures that the local community is well-placed to claim the long-term benefits of the energy transition.”

Project manager Richard Barker added: “From the earliest stages of project development for the consented Three Oaks Renewable Energy Park, we have worked with landowners, local experts and the community to shape a scheme that reflects local priorities and answers local needs.

“We will continue this partnership work, and I look forward to further engagement on this exciting project.”

RenewableUK’s head of onshore wind James Robottom added: “Following hot on the heels of the Onshore Wind Taskforce Strategy published last week, this announcement is hugely welcome and exactly what the industry needs.

“It is also an example of the progress the Government is making towards Clean Power 2030, creating a regulatory environment where new opportunities for inward investment can be realised. It is really positive to see wind able to be part of an energy park project making the most efficient use of our land and resource and I am excited to see this taken forward.”",https://renews.biz/media/22083/generic_onshore_abby_anaday_unsplash.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-07-07 10:08:20.763264

The Act makes a number of significant changes to the tax credits available with respect to renewable energy and energy storage projects, including the clean electricity production credit under Section 45Y of the Internal Revenue Code (the “PTC”) and the clean electricity investment credit under Section 48E of the Internal Revenue Code (the “ITC”), among others. These changes also scale back some of the taxpayer-favorable renewable energy-related provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. For a description of the renewable energy and energy storage-related changes made in the Inflation Reduction Act, see our prior alert.

Following is a summary of some of the more significant provisions of the Act related to renewable energy and energy storage projects.

PTC and ITC Phase-Out for Wind and Solar

If construction of a qualified wind or solar facility begins after the 12-month anniversary of enactment of the Act, the facility must be placed in service on or before December 31, 2027 to qualify for the PTC or ITC, as applicable. This phase-out only applies to wind and solar facilities, and the Act makes clear that the phase-out does not apply to the ITC with respect to energy storage technology, including energy storage technology that is placed in service at a wind or solar facility. If construction of a project begins before the 12-month deadline, the December 31, 2027, placed-in-service deadline does not apply, and the normal beginning-of-construction rules would apply, including the four-year continuity safe harbor.

The phase-out does not impact the pre-2025 production tax credit under Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code or the pre-2025 investment tax credit under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code. In both cases, if construction of a project began before January 1, 2025, there is no statutory placed-in-service phaseout, although the continuous efforts requirements (including the four-year continuity safe harbor) in the beginning-of-construction guidance would continue to apply. The phasedowns of these credits under the IRA remain in place.

There has been some discussion among members of Congress and the Executive Branch about narrowing the longstanding beginning-of-construction rules. Those rules are contained in IRS Notices, which can be changed without legislative or regulatory action and can be changed retroactively. We are not aware of any specific effort to change these rules, but there is some concern that changes could be made.

Domestic Content Threshold for ITC

The Act corrects a mistake in the IRA related to the domestic content bonus credit threshold applicable to the ITC. To qualify for the domestic content bonus for either the PTC or the ITC, a designated adjusted percentage of manufacturer’s costs related to manufactured products in a facility must be attributable to manufactured products that were mined, produced, or manufactured in the U.S. Under the provisions adopted in the IRA, the adjusted percentage for the PTC is 40% if construction of a facility begins before 2025, 45% if construction begins in 2025, 50% if construction begins in 2026, and 55% if construction begins after 2026. The adjusted percentage for the ITC was mistakenly fixed in the IRA at 40% regardless of when construction of a facility began.

The Act corrects this mistake and applies a graduated adjusted percentage requirement for the ITC domestic content bonus credit similar to the PTC. Under the Act, if construction of a facility with respect to which the ITC is claimed begins before June 16, 2025, the adjusted percentage is 40%. If construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before January 1, 2026, the adjusted percentage is 45%. If construction begins in 2026, the adjusted percentage is 50%; if construction begins after 2026, the adjusted percentage is 55%.

Prohibited Foreign Entity (“PFE”) Rules

The Act contains a number of rules applicable to PFEs. Following is a summary of some of the more significant aspects of these rules:

Material Assistance from a Prohibited Foreign Entity

The Act includes provisions that disallow the PTC and ITC with respect to a facility construction of which includes any “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.”

A PFE is defined for this purpose to include any “specified foreign entity” and any “foreign-influenced entity.”

A “specified foreign entity” is defined for this purpose to include:

A foreign entity of concern described in 15 USC § 4651(8)(A), (B), (D), or (E) (e., designated terrorist organizations, designated blocked persons, entities that have been alleged to be involved in certain espionage, arms dealing, or similar crimes, and entities determined to be involved in conduct that threatens national security);

An entity identified as a Chinese military company operating in the US in accordance with 10 USC § 113;

An entity included on a list required by Public Law 117-78 Section 2(d)(2)(B)(i), (ii), (iv), or (v), of entities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region that uses forced labor;

An entity specified under Section 154(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024; or

A foreign-controlled entity. This includes the government of a covered nation (North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran), an agency or instrumentality of a covered nation, a person who is a citizen or national of a covered nation, an entity organized or headquartered in a covered nation, or an entity controlled by any of the foregoing.

A “foreign-influenced entity” is defined to include any entity for any taxable year:

With respect to which a specified foreign entity has the direct authority to appoint a covered officer;

In which a single specified foreign entity owns a 25% or greater interest;

In which one or more specified foreign entities collectively own a 40% or greater interest;

15% or more of the debt of which is held by one or more specified foreign entities;

Which, during the previous taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement or other arrangement that entitles a specified foreign entity (or related entity) to exercise “effective control” over any qualified facility or energy storage technology owned by the taxpayer (or a related person).

“Effective control” is defined to include:

An agreement or arrangement that provides a contractual counterparty with “specific authority over key aspects of * * * energy generation in a qualified facility, or energy storage * * *.” The Bill directs the Treasury Department to issue guidance to implement this rule and provides that, until this guidance is issued, “the term ‘effective control’ means the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual party to,” among other things:

Determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity undertaken at a qualified facility or storage of electricity in energy storage technology owned by the taxpayer,

Determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility,

Restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology, or to the personnel or agents of the contractual counterparty, or

“On an exclusive basis,” maintain, repair, or operate any equipment which is necessary to the production by the taxpayer of electricity.

With respect to a licensing or similar agreement for the provision of intellectual property with respect to a qualified facility or energy storage technology, any of the following:

A right to specify or direct one or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals used in the qualified facility or energy storage technology;

A right to direct the operation of any qualified facility or energy storage technology;

A right to limit the taxpayer’s utilization of intellectual property related to the operation of a qualified facility or energy storage technology;

A right to receive royalties under a licensing agreement or similar agreement beyond the 10th year of the agreement;

A right to require the taxpayer to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than two years; or

A contract that was entered into on or after enactment of the Act.

“Material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” is defined as, with respect to any qualified facility or energy storage technology, having a “material assistance cost ratio” that is less than the threshold percentage designated for the year in which construction begins.

The designated material assistance cost ratio thresholds applicable to a qualified facility are:

If construction begins in 2026, 40%

If construction begins in 2027, 45%

If construction begins in 2028, 50%

If construction begins in 2029, 55%

If construction begins after 2029, 60%

The designated material assistance cost ratio thresholds applicable to energy storage technology are:

If construction begins in 2026, 55%

If construction begins in 2027, 60%

If construction begins in 2028, 65%

If construction begins in 2029, 70%

If construction begins after 2029, 75%

The term “material assistance cost ratio” is defined as the percentage of the total direct costs to the taxpayer attributable to all manufactured products that are incorporated into a facility or energy storage technology that relate to manufactured products or components that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a person other than a prohibited foreign entity.

The Treasury Department is directed to issue safe harbor tables and guidance to determine the direct costs of any manufactured product that are attributable to a prohibited foreign entity, and to adopt rules to determine the amount of a taxpayer’s material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity. Prior to the date the Treasury Department issues these safe harbor tables and rules:

The tables included in IRS Notice 2025-08 (related to the domestic content bonus credit) may be used to establish “the percentage of the total direct costs of any listed eligible component and any manufactured product,” and

A taxpayer may rely on a certification by the supplier of a manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent of an eligible component regarding (i) the actual direct costs of the product or component that was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, or (ii) that the product or component was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity. The certification must comply with specific requirements in the Act.

Under certain circumstances, manufactured products, eligible components, or constituent elements, materials, or subcomponents that are acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into prior to June 16, 2025, may be excluded from the material assistance cost ratio.

The Act extends the statute of limitations and increases the penalty applicable to an understatement of tax if the PTC or ITC is disallowed as a result of an overstatement of the material assistance cost ratio for a facility. The Act also imposes a penalty on any person that provides a non-PFE certification that was inaccurate or false and that results in a reduction in the PTC or ITC.

The Act includes an anti-circumvention provision that authorizes the Treasury Department to adopt rules to avoid circumvention of the material assistance provision. These may include rules to prevent any abuse of the special rule related to contracts entered into before June 16, 2025, by “stockpiling” manufactured products or components and any evasion of the material assistance rules where facts and circumstances demonstrate that construction of a facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Recapture of ITC for Certain Payments to Prohibited Foreign Entity

The Act also imposes 100% ITC recapture if any “applicable payment” is made by a “specified taxpayer” with respect to a facility during the 10-year period beginning on the placed-in-service date.

“Applicable payment” is defined to include any payment to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement that entitles such specified foreign entity (or an entity related to such specified foreign entity) to exercise effective control over any qualified facility or energy storage technology owned by the taxpayer.

“Specified foreign entity” and “effective control” have the same meanings as described above for purposes of the material assistance from a PFE rules.

The term “specified taxpayer” means a taxpayer that has claimed the ITC for any taxable year beginning after the date that is two years after the date of enactment of the Act.

The material assistance and applicable payment rules may create challenges for projects that involve Chinese-made components, particularly including energy storage technology. In particular, there is concern regarding installation, operating and maintenance, and other arrangements with these manufacturers. The material assistance rules apply to any project construction of which begins after December 31, 2025. Thus, a taxpayer may avoid the material assistance rules by beginning construction of a project before the end of the year. The applicable payment rules apply only to the extent a taxpayer has claimed the ITC for any taxable year beginning after the date that is two years after the date of enactment of the Act.

In addition to the material assistance and applicable payment rules, the Act provides that no PTC or ITC is allowed for any taxable year if the taxpayer is a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity. This prohibition applies to tax years beginning after the date of enactment of the Act.

Other Energy-Related Changes

Some of the other significant energy-related changes in the Act include:

Denial of the PTC or ITC with respect to solar or small wind energy property that qualified for the residential clean energy credit under Section 25D of the Internal Revenue Code and is subject to a lease arrangement.

Various changes to the manufacturing credit under Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code, including addition of PFE rules and early phase out related to wind turbine components.

Restriction on transferability under Section 6418 of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to facilities that are subject to the prohibited foreign entity limitations.

Accelerated phaseout of the tax credits applicable to clean hydrogen facilities.

A number of the changes in the Act will be supplemented by further guidance from the Treasury Department. Until that guidance is issued there will be uncertainty regarding the operation of some of the changes.

Caveat civitas: governments beware Governments hoping to attract U.S. cleantech must take note that incentives alone no longer differentiate.
This isn’t about giving up on the U.S. market entirely.","The United States remains the world’s leading generator of clean technology breakthroughs. From long-duration batteries and carbon-negative hydrogen to modular nuclear reactors and grid orchestration software, U.S. firms continue to push the technical frontier.

But in the wake of the rollback of key Inflation Reduction Act provisions and the stalling of key Department of Energy loan program funding as reflected in the budget bill signed into law on July 4, a new dynamic is emerging: The U.S. may lead in invention, but others lead in deployment.

The invention-deployment gap

Since the IRA’s passage in 2022, over $300 billion in cleantech investment has been announced. Yet much of it remains unbuilt. Post-2024 political shifts have introduced tax credit uncertainty, delayed DOE loan disbursements, and revoked funds for key clean energy programs. The result is a domestic deployment pipeline that is more congested than active.

But other nations are clearing the road.

Germany has locked in hydrogen procurement through H2Global. The United Kingdom, meanwhile, is extending its proven contracts for differences model to green hydrogen and long-duration storage, while accelerating grid reforms to better support renewable integration. South Korea, Canada, and the European Union are scaling infrastructure with more integrated permitting and public capital. They are paving the way to execute policy, not simply announcing support for projects.

Australia has emerged as a particularly compelling destination. With the Australia Clean Energy Summit coming up on July 29 to 30, the nation is drawing global attention as a proving ground for scalable deployment. Its “Future Made in Australia” package offers IRA-comparable incentives (like critical minerals tax credits) alongside execution-focused tools like the Capacity Investment Scheme.

Taken together with streamlined coordination these elements give Australia stronger momentum toward project realization than most peer economies.

In contrast, the U.S. resembles a traffic jam: skilled cleantech drivers behind the wheels of powerful vehicles, but red lights at every intersection. Companies are experiencing uncertainty about policy and timing, which is creating strategic paralysis.

For CEOs under pressure to deliver growth, sitting in gridlock is no longer viable. Some are already looking to switch lanes. Many more may need to.

A new global strategy for US firms

This shift is not about chasing lower costs. U.S. firms continue to lead in technologies where precision, durability, or resilience matter more than marginal pricing. Examples include technologies like iron-air batteries, carbon-negative hydrogen, battery recycling, and AI-enabled grid software.

Many of these technologies have been validated with a valuable seal of approval: U.S. government due diligence, for example in the form of DOE loan guarantees. But in 2025, even companies with this endorsement are starting to consider how they can find faster paths to revenue.

Those opportunities are increasingly overseas, as many foreign markets are embracing clean tech as a way of achieving their goal of energy independence in the name of national security. Governments are most proactive where the goals of national security, economic efficiency, and environmental protection are mutually compatible, as noted in a recent report from The Carlyle Group.

Those are the ideal markets to drive towards, ones that offer public financing schemes aligned with supportive industrial policy and long-term procurement that make cleantech infrastructure projects more achievable. It’s time to set up shop in places where cleantech is seen as an integral step towards energy independence in the name of national security — with the global climate as an additional beneficiary.

The Australian case study

Australia is particularly suited to this strategy, not only because it is a top-tier resource nation rich in critical minerals, solar, and wind, but also because it maintains one of the world’s most robust trade infrastructures.

With over 15 free trade agreements, including with the U.S., Australia provides tariff-free market access and a compliant supply chain for IRA-aligned exports. That makes Australia a prime landing pad for U.S. firms seeking supply chain resilience and topline growth across the APAC region.

Australia is also attractive for its offtake environment. Import-oriented buyers in Japan, Korea, and Singapore are actively securing future supplies of green hydrogen, ammonia and battery materials — and they’re looking to Australia. With tools like the Capacity Investment Scheme and Long-Term Energy Service Agreements, governments are also stepping in as price stabilizers, reducing merchant risk and anchoring revenue models.

And thanks to the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement and a critical minerals partnership, IRA-aligned companies can source key inputs like lithium, nickel, and rare earths from Australia and still qualify for U.S. tax credits. That kind of dual-market alignment — low-carbon exports to Asia, and supply chain integration with U.S. decarbonization — is rare. For companies thinking globally, Australia offers offtake opportunities that are deeper, faster and more bankable than many currently available in the United States.

Execution over enthusiasm

Most U.S. cleantech businesses ready for deployments at scale don’t have teams ready for global expansion. They often lack large headcounts and have limited capital resources. But that shouldn’t be a death knell for smart global growth.

There is a more intelligent way to achieve global growth in a cost-effective way. The key is to 1) focus on high-readiness countries where policy aligns with offtake demand and public financing appetite, 2) leverage existing prior DOE awards to fast-track new funding approvals, and 3) build market fluency through a staged process to minimize upfront cash spend and allocate risk. That staging is best achieved via structured frameworks that leverage shared objectives of different constituencies, including co-developer partners, PFIs/ECAs, and offtakers.

This is not speculative globetrotting. It’s targeted deployment where demand is strong and the host government is welcoming.

And it’s also not offshoring. Global deployment isn’t about giving up on the U.S. market. On the contrary, by building offshore these companies can capture additional market share that they would not have otherwise won. It’s a way for U.S. cleantech to expand market share and maintain momentum.

What doesn’t work? Waiting for perfect clarity, or else assuming domestic patience will prevail over international momentum.

Caveat civitas: governments beware

Governments hoping to attract U.S. cleantech must take note that incentives alone no longer differentiate. Simply putting an “open for business” sign on the door is insufficient.

These countries are in competition with each other to attract cleantech and to make their market the preferred destination. The ones that win investment will be those that are best at:

Offering clear pathways from interest to infrastructure;

Coordinating funding, offtake and permitting;

Accepting DOE approvals and other U.S. federal diligence as a shortcut for their own due diligence; and

Treating American companies as co-developers, not just as suppliers

The measure of competitiveness in this environment is execution, not enthusiasm. As U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said, “we have to build faster, cheaper, cleaner — and yes, that means cutting the red tape, not just the ribbon.”

Taking the open lane

There’s still hope among some executives that U.S. policy clarity will return. But time is not on their side. Investors are impatient, and so are customers. And delayed opportunities translate into lost value.

In the words of early-20th century actor Will Rogers, “even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.” His century-old warning applies to cleantech today.

This isn’t about giving up on the U.S. market entirely. It’s about companies finding a way to stay in the game. The companies going global aren’t abandoning the U.S. They’re hedging, diversifying, accelerating, and proving their capacity to deliver.

It’s time to take the initiative and start building where the road is already open. Yes, America still invents. But if other countries continue to deploy faster, they will shape the future cleantech economy. And the companies that want to lead it won’t wait for traffic to clear; they’ll take the open lane.

Gary D. Robertson reports for The Associated Press.

In short:

The vetoed bill would have eliminated a requirement for North Carolina to cut power sector carbon emissions 70% from 2005 levels by 2030, though a 2050 carbon neutrality goal would remain.

Supporters, including Duke Energy and Republican lawmakers, argue the rollback would reduce costs by at least $13 billion and allow cheaper power generation methods in the short term.

Opponents, including environmental groups and Gov. Stein, say the repeal weakens climate commitments and could raise long-term energy costs due to continued reliance on volatile natural gas.

Key quote:

The bill “walks back our state’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy.”

— Josh Stein, governor of North Carolina

Why this matters:

Greenhouse gas mandates shape how utilities invest in energy infrastructure, influencing public health, economic growth, and environmental resilience. Repealing near-term emissions targets could slow the shift from fossil fuels to renewables, extending dependence on natural gas and other high-emission sources. That reliance brings volatility and long-term costs as fuel prices fluctuate and federal climate policies evolve. North Carolina’s original 2030 target was part of a broader movement among states to modernize power generation and reduce pollution-related harms like asthma, heart disease, and heat-related illness. Rolling back the mandate may ease short-term utility expenses but could delay benefits tied to cleaner air, stable rates, and climate resilience.",https://assets.rbl.ms/61168944/origin.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 09:16:31.320884

Why is Latin America lagging in the global nuclear energy race, and could that be about to change? From Mexico to Argentina, fresh momentum is sparking a revival of long-stalled ambitions. We speak with Latin America-based forwarders, developers, and industry experts to uncover the emerging opportunities – and challenges – as nuclear energy edges back onto the regional agenda.

From Issue 4, 2025 of Breakbulk Magazine.

(5-minuter read)

Nuclear power has long played a minor role in Latin America’s energy mix, but that may soon change. As countries search for reliable, low-carbon solutions, nuclear is gaining fresh momentum, with the emergence of small modular reactors (SMRs) – advanced reactors with a generating capacity of up to 300 megawatts (MW) – expanding investment options and opening up potential new project opportunities.

Recent moves across the region signal a shift – most notably in Argentina.

Earlier this year, Demian Reidel – head of President Javier Milei’s council of advisors – revealed plans to install four locally-designed ACR-300 SMRs at the Atucha nuclear site at Zarate, Buenos Aires province. The reactors would boast a combined 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of power, with the first unit slated to be operational by 2030.

“This (the installation of ACR-300s) is just the first stage,” Reidel said at an energy conference in Buenos Aires province in June. “We will then license this technology to the rest of the world. This will not only transform our energy mix – it will also change Argentina’s export mix. We have an enormous competitive advantage: extraordinary human capital and our own technology.”

As part of the government’s broader push to launch a new nuclear era, officials have also proposed restarting uranium mining and enrichment and even building a “Nuclear City”, a would-be clean energy hub for nuclear-powered data centers in southern Patagonia.

Argentina already operates three large-scale nuclear power plants (NPPs) – Atucha I, Atucha II, and Embalse – with a combined capacity of more than 1.6 GWe. The facilities supply about 6% of the nation’s electricity. The country’s National Atomic Energy Commission (Comisión Nacional de Energía Atómica, or CNEA), which oversees research and development of nuclear energy in Argentina, is also developing CAREM25, a 29-MWe SMR prototype, at the Atucha plant site at Zarate.

Juan Turner, director and owner of Argentina-based project forwarder Rowners, said he expected project cargo for the buildout of the ACR-300 reactors to move in both directions – imports coming into the country and deliveries leaving it.

Rowners, a member of The Heavy Lift Group (THLG), has valuable experience in the sector – the company’s in-house customs broker supported the Atucha II facility for more than two years, managing the import of critical materials – mainly through air freight – for the facility’s start-up phase.

“There will certainly be import shipments arriving in Argentina to support the project,” Turner said. “And if the technology proves scalable for international markets, there’s potential for export cargo as well. While this won’t happen immediately, we do expect cargo flows both ways. We’re confident there’s room for nuclear energy growth in Argentina and the broader region.”

Brazil Looks Beyond Angra

Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy, also sees nuclear energy as a key element of its long-term energy transition strategy.

State-controlled Eletronuclear operates the Angra 1 and Angra 2 full-scale plants in Rio de Janeiro state and is currently building the Angra 3 facility, although the project has suffered numerous setbacks since plans were first drawn up four decades ago to build a third reactor at Angra dos Reis.

Eletronuclear said the 1.4-GW plant is 65 percent complete.

“The completion of Angra 3 remains a central priority,” Leonam Guimarães, CEO of Eletronuclear between 2017 to 2022, told Breakbulk. “Once operational – expected around the early 2030s – it will add significant dispatchable capacity to the southeast grid.”

Guimarães, who currently serves as executive directorate advisor at Amazul, a Brazilian state-owned company that helps develop and manage nuclear and defense technologies, pointed to growing interest in deploying SMRs, especially in remote northern regions with weak infrastructure and variable hydropower.

SMRs could also offer low-carbon energy and heat for heavy industries in states such as Pará and Minas Gerais and support clean hydrogen production for domestic use and export.

“While no SMR projects have yet entered the licensing phase, feasibility studies are underway, and Brazilian stakeholders – government agencies, research centers, and industry players – are closely monitoring international SMR developments,” Guimarães said. “The country’s near-term focus remains on completing Angra 3, but the medium-to-long-term outlook includes a more diversified nuclear portfolio, in which SMRs should play a role.”

Nuclear Expansion Gap

Promising steps aside, Latin America’s nuclear expansion still lags behind other regions.

According to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), 440 nuclear power reactors are operating across 31 countries worldwide with a combined capacity of about 400 GWe. In 2023 these provided 2,602 terawatt-hours (TWh,) about 9% of the world’s electricity. Latin America accounts for only seven of those reactors – three in Argentina and two each in Brazil and Mexico – with a total capacity of 5 GWe.

Additionally, around 70 reactors are under construction worldwide, with a further 100 planned. Just one of those is in Latin America – Argentina’s CAREM25, the world’s first SMR to reach construction stage. The project has been slated to come online by 2028.

Still, among the 30 countries pinpointed by the WNA that are considering, planning or starting nuclear power programs, seven are in Latin America and the Caribbean: Cuba, Chile, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay.

Added to that list could be El Salvador, whose lawmakers last year passed legislation to create a regulatory framework for building and operating NPPs. Earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed a landmark civil nuclear cooperation agreement with El Salvador – the first such deal in Central America.

Unlocking the full potential of nuclear power will require the region to tackle several challenges.

Andrés Rebolledo, a former Chilean energy minister and now executive secretary of the Latin American Energy Organization (Olade), said priorities include updating regulations to align with international safety standards and streamlining the permitting system for new projects – particularly SMRs.

Innovative financing models, including public-private partnerships and government guarantees, will be key, he said, alongside regional cooperation and support from bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Rebolledo pointed to the “significant advantages” of SMRs for Latin America, citing lower upfront costs compared with traditional gigawatt-scale reactors, modular designs that enable phased deployment, and easier installation in hard-to-access locations.

Infrastructure Constraints

Among those eyeing SMR deployment is Colombia, a country anxious to offset an over-reliance on hydro power, which accounts for about 70% of its electricity output.

In its latest national energy plan, the government included proposals to add up to 1.8 GW of nuclear capacity by 2052, specifically through advanced technologies such as SMRs and high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), a type of reactor designed to produce very high-temperature heat, typically above 700°C.

The country is working with organizations including the IAEA and the U.S. Department of Energy to expand the know-how and infrastructure to kickstart its nuclear transition.

Jorge Cassalins, business development manager at Colombia-based heavy-lift specialist Kando Global – also a member of THLG – said the country faces some major hurdles in developing a nuclear energy supply chain.

Its success, he explained, will depend on securing a steady supply of components and services – from technology providers and system integrators to equipment makers, subcomponent suppliers and raw material producers.

Gaps in the transport system pose a significant challenge as well, with 74% of freight transport relying on roads and nearly half of the country’s 3,500-kilometer rail network inactive. “Colombia is very dependent on road transportation, and alternate options are highly desirable for nuclear energy projects,” Cassalins said.

Developing a skilled workforce is also a critical step for Colombia’s nuclear ambitions, he added, with human resource development needed long before plant construction and operations begin. Encouragingly, a new introductory course on NPPs and emerging technologies is being developed at one of the country’s top universities.

“We are taking the first baby steps towards nuclear energy academics, but we do need more sturdy and skilled university programs,” he said.

In Colombia and other countries across the region – particularly those without prior nuclear experience – closing these gaps will be crucial to unlocking development.

Worldwide, the WNA has estimated a mouthwatering US$2 trillion investment opportunity for the global nuclear supply chain over the next 15 years. “I think Latin America will account for quite a small segment of that,” said Henry Preston, media and communications manager at the WNA. “But there’s still a massive opportunity.”

Rowners and Kando Global will be exhibiting with THLG at Breakbulk Americas 2025. Be part of our 35th anniversary event taking place on 30 Sep - 2 Oct in Houston.

For Chinese automakers, the message is sobering: building cars in North America isn’t just a logistics problem.","When word spread last winter that BYD was scouting central Mexico for a multibillion-dollar factory, governors from Coahuila to Querétaro rolled out the red carpet. They offered rail spurs, tax holidays, even housing plots for 10,000 promised employees.

Yet on July 2 BYD’s Latin America boss Stella Li picked up the phone and told them to stand down. Citing “geopolitical uncertainty” and a U.S. tariff war that refuses to cool, she said the project is off the table…“indefinitely”. Now matter how Mexican authorities gave the VIP treatment to BYD, the final decision was always up to the USA market.

From sprint to screeching halt

Rumors of a BYD plant first surfaced in February 2024. By summer, the short-list was down to three land parcels near major rail corridors, and local press reported a capacity of 150,000 electric crossovers a year at prices that could undercut any U.S.-built rival. In January this year, Mexican media trumpeted a figure: 10,000 direct jobs, twice what Tesla’s long-stalled Nuevo León gigafactory would create.

But the countdown stopped the moment the White House, now under Donald Trump, announced a 25 percent tariff on any vehicle “controlled by a Chinese parent” even if final assembly happens in Mexico. The rule, designed to close what lobbyists called the “dragon loophole,” erased BYD’s cost advantage overnight.

Beijing pulls the handbrake

Trade headwinds weren’t the only factor. The Financial Times revealed in April that Chinese regulators feared Mexico could become an “intellectual-property conduit,” allowing U.S. engineers to reverse-engineer BYD’s lithium-iron-phosphate blade batteries. Beijing delayed export permits for key production equipment, effectively freezing the project weeks before BYD went public with its pause.

State officials say the plant would have lifted regional GDP by nearly one percentage point. Now, freight-rail upgrades and a proposed battery-grade lithium refinery in Sonora are stuck in limbo.

Winners on the sidelines

Detroit automakers quietly exhaled. BYD’s cancelled Mexican beachhead means Americans won’t see a $22,000 Dolphin hatchback or a $15,000 Seagull city car sailing duty-free across the Rio Grande. Instead, BYD will focus on its nearly finished complex in Bahia, Brazil—a market with no Trump-era tariffs and 25 percent import taxes of its own to deter foreign competition.

The Mexican peso barely moved on the news (investors have grown numb to factory teasers that vanish) but BYD’s Hong Kong-listed shares closed down 4 percent the next day, erasing roughly $5 billion in market value. Some analysts called the decision prudent; others said BYD has surrendered first-mover advantage in North America.

What U.S. drivers lose

For American shoppers hoping for a sub-$25 k EV that beats a Chevy Bolt on range, the dream inches further away. Importing BYD cars directly from China now triggers a 100 percent Section 301 tariff, pushing a $12 k Seagull north of $24 k before dealer mark-ups. Building in Brazil avoids that penalty but still faces the 25 percent truck tariff if vehicles arrive by sea.

Could the deal revive?

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her door remains open. Industry insiders outline two hurdles:

Tariff clarity. If Washington exempts Mexican-made EVs from the new “Chinese parent” clause—perhaps after WTO challenges—BYD would reconsider.

Tech safeguards. Beijing wants legal assurances its battery patents won’t leak across the border. Mexico’s nascent IP-protection regime must win that trust.

Until then, BYD will ship cars from China to Latin markets and accelerate its Brazilian plant, slated to open in early 2026.

Final gear change

Just a year ago BYD’s Mexico announcement looked like the moment Chinese automakers would storm the last big car market they hadn’t cracked. Instead, trade politics and cross-Pacific mistrust slammed the gate shut before the first brick was laid. The casualty list now includes thousands of hypothetical Mexican jobs and millions of hypothetical cheap EVs for American driveways.

For Chinese automakers, the message is sobering: building cars in North America isn’t just a logistics problem. It’s a diplomatic dance, and one wrong tariff can clear the dance floor in a heartbeat.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/byd-seal-car.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 08:03:50.596564

Investors seeking exposure to the energy transition should take a position before the market catches up to NRG's renewable pivot.","The energy sector is undergoing a seismic shift as regulatory pressures and soaring demand for clean power drive utilities toward renewable infrastructure. NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG) stands at a pivotal crossroads: its ability to pivot from fossil fuels to solar and storage assets will determine whether it becomes a leader in this transition—or a relic of the past. While the market has yet to fully price in NRG's strategic moves, a closer look at its recent acquisitions, regulatory tailwinds, and federal incentives reveals an undervalued growth story waiting to unfold.

The Regulatory Imperative Driving Renewable Adoption

The U.S. government's push for decarbonization is no longer theoretical. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocated $369 billion to clean energy, including production tax credits for solar and storage projects. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan and state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) are forcing utilities to slash emissions. For NRG, which historically relied on coal and natural gas, this creates both a threat and an opportunity.

NRG's Subtle Shift Toward Renewables

Despite a lack of headline-grabbing solar acquisitions post-2023, NRG is quietly building a renewable ecosystem through strategic partnerships and under-the-radar moves:

1. Vivint Smart Home Integration: Its 2023 acquisition of Vivint, while primarily a play on smart home tech, now includes a solar data platform. Vivint's rooftop solar installations and energy management systems provide NRG with a direct customer pipeline for distributed energy resources.

2. Virtual Power Plant (VPP) Platform: NRG's acquisition of Premier Power's C&I VPP platform positions it to aggregate residential and commercial storage systems, creating a decentralized grid asset that regulators increasingly favor.

3. Federal Incentive Leverage: NRG's Texas Energy Fund projects, though gas-fired, are now being paired with storage upgrades eligible for IRA tax credits. This hybrid approach lowers costs and aligns with state mandates for grid resilience.

Why the Market Underestimates NRG's Potential

Analysts have largely overlooked two critical factors:

- Undervalued Storage Assets: NRG's VPP platform and storage-adjacent projects are not yet reflected in its valuation. Storage is the linchpin of renewable adoption, and NRG's early position could yield disproportionate returns as battery costs decline.

- Regulatory Tailwinds: State regulators are increasingly allowing utilities to earn higher returns on storage and grid modernization investments. NRG's Texas and California operations, two of the most progressive markets, stand to benefit first.

Data-Driven Perspective on NRG's Undervaluation

At a current P/E of 12.5x, NRG trades at a 30% discount to the XLU average of 17.8x. This gap persists despite its 25% revenue growth from distributed energy services in 2024 (per Q3 earnings). Comparatively, pure-play renewables firms like NextEra Energy (NEE) trade at 25x, suggesting NRG's transition is still underappreciated.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip, Play the Transition

NRG is a “value trap” waiting to be unlocked. Investors should consider:

- Catalyst #1: 2025 will see the first wave of RPS compliance deadlines, driving utilities to accelerate solar/storage projects. NRG's backlog of 2.4 GW of contracted renewable projects (as of Q2 2024) positions it to deliver earnings upside.

- Catalyst #2: Vivint's solar data platform could become a profit engine as NRG bundles it with energy storage sales, creating a sticky revenue stream.

- Risk Mitigation: NRG's diversified portfolio (still 60% fossil fuel revenue) provides a stable cash flow base to fund renewables expansion.

Historical performance supports this approach: backtesting NRG's stock from 2020 to 2025 reveals that buying on positive quarterly earnings announcements typically led to price appreciation as investor interest surged. Holding the position for 30 days further capitalized on this sentiment while minimizing short-term volatility risks.

Backtest the performance of NRG (NYSE:NRG) when buying on positive quarterly earnings announcements and holding for 30 trading days, from 2020 to 2025.

Final Call: A Rare Buy in the Utility Space

With NRG trading at a valuation discount and sitting atop a regulatory and incentive-driven tailwind, the risk-reward here is compelling. The stock's 15% dividend yield (vs. XLU's 4.2%) adds a safety net. Investors seeking exposure to the energy transition should take a position before the market catches up to NRG's renewable pivot.

The era of fossil fuel dominance is ending. NRG's strategic moves, though subtle, are aligning it with the future of energy. This is a buy for the long game.",,N,,2025-07-07 14:25:24.229823

Surging U.S. Power Demand: A Decade of Unprecedented Growth Ahead

The U.S. is entering a new era of energy demand, driven by the explosive growth of data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), Web3 infrastructure, and the reshoring of industrial development:

The U.S. Department of Energy projects data centers alone could consume up to 12% of the nation's electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023.

Goldman Sachs estimates global data center power use will rise by 50% by 2027, fueled by next-gen computing needs.

McKinsey forecasts U.S. data center demand will more than triple to 80 gigawatts by 2030.

In Texas, grid operator ERCOT expects peak power demand to nearly double by 2031, driven by large-scale digital and industrial expansion.

This wave of demand puts enormous pressure on the grid and creates a critical need for reliable backup power and decentralized diesel fuel sources.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union will develop rules for “nature credits” that pay farmers and foresters to take care of ecosystems, in an attempt to make this work more economically beneficial, the European Commission said on Monday.

The EU is hunting for ways to increase funding for protecting the environment, without further straining public budgets stretched thin by other priorities like defence.

The EU, which pays out huge subsidies to farmers under its Common Agricultural Policy, estimates it has a 37-billion-euro ($43 billion) annual shortfall in funding needed to protect biodiversity.

The Commission will this year form an expert group – including governments, farmers, local communities and scientists – to work on developing methodologies for “nature credits”, and fund a pilot project for these credits by 2027, it said.

This would let companies or countries buy credits issued by farmers, foresters and other land managers protecting nature by, for example, planting trees, restoring a wetland, or switching to regenerative types of agriculture.

The expert group will assess how to certify nature credits and govern a market for them, before deciding whether to fix this into EU law.

“This is not about turning nature into a commodity, but about recognising and rewarding actions that restore and sustain nature,” EU environment commissioner Jessika Roswall told reporters.

The idea mirrors a more developed market for “carbon credits”, in which projects that reduce CO2 emissions sell credits to companies seeking to support efforts to address climate change. However, the carbon credit market has been mired by recent scandals in which projects that issued credits failed to deliver the climate benefits they claimed.

Brussels proposed an EU climate target for 2040 last week which would allow countries to count international carbon credits towards the EU goal for the first time.

The Commission said on Monday it was aware of the “challenges and opportunities” carbon credit markets had highlighted.

Tammy Kim, Ruth Marcus, Peter Slevin, Susan B. Glasser",,,,,https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/sheldon-whitehouses-three-hundredth-climate-warning,"“Biden was making a lot of positive noises about taking climate stuff seriously,” Whitehouse said, explaining the move.
“Sure enough, the Biden Administration was pretty spongy,” he said.
On July 9th, Whitehouse is scheduled to give his three-hundredth “Time to Wake Up” speech.
Between the Administration’s executive actions and the provisions of the tax bill, a catalogue of all the climate-busting moves of the past six months would run to hundreds of entries.
Offering a summary, he said, “We’ve now entered the era of consequences of our climate negligence.","On April 18th, 2012, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse delivered the first in what was to become one of the—if not the—longest-running series of speeches in congressional history. This was toward the end of Barack Obama’s first term, and Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, thought that the President wasn’t doing enough, or really much of anything, to fight climate change. “There were years at a time when the Obama Administration wouldn’t use the word climate and change in the same paragraph,” Whitehouse recalled recently, in a Zoom interview from his office. “And so I made the decision—rather than get jostled around by whatever the current events of the week were, every damn week I was going to do a speech on climate.” He had a poster made up showing the Earth as seen from space. Next to the planet, the poster said “TIME TO WAKE UP” in boxy white letters.

Whitehouse continued to deliver his (more or less) weekly “Time to Wake Up” speeches through Obama’s second term and Donald Trump’s first. He’d prop his increasingly battered sign on an easel and, addressing a mostly empty Senate floor, talk about the latest developments in climate science, the latest climate-related disasters, and Congress’s continuing inaction. “Congress is still doing nothing,” he noted in his two-hundred-and-second speech, delivered in April, 2018.

When Joe Biden took office, in January, 2021, Whitehouse gave up his weekly speeches. “Biden was making a lot of positive noises about taking climate stuff seriously,” Whitehouse said, explaining the move. But he suspected it might be temporary. When the Smithsonian called to ask him to donate his poster to its collection, he demurred: “I said, ‘Thank you, but I just may need it again, so I’m going to hang on to it.’ ” In February, 2022, he pulled his sign out of storage. “Sure enough, the Biden Administration was pretty spongy,” he said. “And so I went back to the speeches again, not weekly but regularly, to try to jostle them along into a better stance.” In the summer of 2022, Congress passed—and Biden signed—the first major piece of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, the Inflation Reduction Act (I.R.A.), which authorized hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of tax credits and grants to promote clean-energy development. Nevertheless, Whitehouse continued to occasionally trot out his sign in 2023 and 2024.

On July 9th, Whitehouse is scheduled to give his three-hundredth “Time to Wake Up” speech. Depending on how you look at things, the timing couldn’t be better or it couldn’t be worse.

Trump 2.0 has treated climate action with the administrative equivalent of a bunker-buster bomb. The White House has tried to obliterate not just the federal programs aimed at reducing emissions but state and corporate efforts as well. It has demolished many government programs that support climate science and has shuttered many climate-related websites, including the one devoted to National Climate Assessment reports, the next edition of which, due in 2027, it has tried to cancel.

Meanwhile, the Administration has been showering the fossil-fuel industry with love. This started the day of Trump’s second Inauguration, when he issued an executive order declaring an “energy emergency” and pointedly left wind and solar off the list of “energy resources.” Just about every week since has brought a new billet-doux to the industry: the huge tax-and-spending bill Trump signed last week is, as Mark Gongloff, a Bloomberg Opinion editor, put it, “larded” with new tax breaks for fossil-fuel producers, including an expanded tax break for using captured carbon dioxide to pump more oil. “It’s hard to imagine a less-deserving recipient” of taxpayer largesse, Gongloff wrote.

Between the Administration’s executive actions and the provisions of the tax bill, a catalogue of all the climate-busting moves of the past six months would run to hundreds of entries. (Climate Backtracker, a website run by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, currently lists a hundred and ninety-six steps that the Trump Administration has taken to “scale back or wholly eliminate federal climate mitigation and adaptation measures.”) Some of the most consequential climate backtracking moves Republicans have made since January include:

Cancelling fees for methane leaks

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas—in the short to medium term, many times more powerful than carbon dioxide—and under the I.R.A., oil and gas companies that failed to curb methane leaks were going to have to start paying a per-ton fee. In February, Congress voted to eliminate the rules that the Biden Administration had drawn up for administering the fees, and, under the bill Trump signed last week, the start date for the charge was put off for a decade, meaning that the methane-reduction effort seems dead for the foreseeable future.

Eliminating the I.R.A. tax credits for clean energy

Among the many tax credits that Congress recently voted to repeal or phase out are credits for wind- and solar-energy production, for clean-energy investment, for purchasing electric vehicles, and for making home energy-efficiency improvements. Researchers at Princeton University have calculated that the bill will increase the U.S.’s emissions by almost two hundred million metric tons per year by 2030. And researchers at the Rhodium Group have estimated that, in the same time frame, the bill could raise energy costs for households by almost two hundred dollars a year. “This bill will strand thousands of energy projects under development, jeopardize billions of dollars in private investment, and kill hundreds of thousands of good-paying American jobs,” the Coalition for Community Solar Access said, in a statement, the day the Senate passed its version of the legislation.

Revoking California’s waivers

Under a provision of the Clean Air Act, California has the power to set vehicle-emission standards that are stricter than federal regulations. Exercising this power, the state had decided that all new cars sold there after 2035 would have to be at least partly electric-powered, and many other states had announced plans to follow California’s lead. But, in May, Congress voted to overrule the so-called California waiver. It’s unclear whether the move was legal—California and ten other states have sued to block the overrule—but the turmoil, on top of the repeal of the federal electric-vehicle tax credit, seems likely to significantly slow E.V. sales.

All this is happening, of course, as global temperatures continue to rise. Last year was the hottest year on record. Global temperatures for the first three months of this year were very nearly as high as last year’s, even though, in the meantime, the world had entered a so-called La Niña phase, which typically brings cooler weather. In late March, Arctic sea ice reached a record-low extent for the end of the winter, and, in February, Antarctic sea ice reached a near-record-low minimum for any time of year. According to a recent study in the journal Earth System Science Data, warming is accelerating: between 2015 and 2024, the planet heated up at a rate of .27 degrees Celsius—half a degree Fahrenheit—“a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record.”

The other day, Whitehouse was still working on the details of his three-hundredth speech. Offering a summary, he said, “We’ve now entered the era of consequences of our climate negligence. The stuff that the scientists predicted is actually starting to happen, and now that it’s so real and immediate, we should consider how it is that we failed so badly.”

Asked how effective any wake-up call that’s been repeated three hundred times could be, he replied, “I think that the work that I’ve done has made a real, if incremental, difference. The problem is that it’s up against the massive apparatus of corrupt influence that the fossil-fuel industry runs, and that now controls the Republican Party. And it’s really hard for any one person, even a U.S. Senator, to succeed at disabling that.” ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6862a2d577c97964bc877354/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kolbert-Whitehouse.jpg",N,,2025-07-07 07:09:57.958107

Illinois’ small-reactor exception to its nuclear power plant moratorium was a small step, not a comprehensive energy strategy.","New York just did what Illinois lawmakers have failed to do for nearly four decades: commit to building a real nuclear power plant.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul recently announced plans to add at least one gigawatt of new nuclear capacity — power for 1 million homes — as part of the state’s effort to stabilize its energy grid and reduce carbon emissions. It’s the first major U.S. nuclear plant initiative in over 15 years and a signal that New York understands the stakes of a rapidly shifting energy future.

Illinois, by contrast, is stuck in the past. Lawmakers lifted part of the state’s nearly 40-year moratorium on new nuclear plants in 2023. The change hasn’t resulted in any new nuclear generation.

Instead of fully reopening the door to large-scale, grid-connected reactors, the state approved only the use of “small modular reactors,” or SMRs — experimental units that don’t even exist commercially in the United States. The only company with a certified SMR design, NuScale Power, pulled the plug on its plans to develop the first reactors the same day the Illinois bill passed.

This year, lawmakers introduced legislation to lift the ban completely but were bogged down by negotiations with environmental groups and hesitance from Gov. JB Pritzker. Pritzker says he’s open to expansion, just not yet.

Hochul framed it bluntly: Businesses and families must have reliable, affordable power. Nuclear is the only emissions-free baseload source that can provide it 24/7.

It’s past time lawmakers cleared this unnecessary barrier toward expanding clean and independent energy in Illinois.

Illinois generates more electricity from nuclear energy than any other state. In 2023, the state’s six nuclear power plants, with 11 total reactors, produced 54% of the state’s net electricity generation. But Illinois’ energy demand is set to outpace supply by 2030. The state, additionally, has committed to a carbon-free grid by 2050. But wind and solar, while important, are intermittent. Without nuclear energy to provide the stable, always-on foundation for clean energy, those goals are slipping further from reach.

The rise of data centers driven by artificial intelligence and electrified infrastructure means we’ll need more reliable power to attract tech jobs and avoid blackouts and price spikes.

Businesses have already signaled their interest in increasing nuclear power capacity in Illinois. Meta recently signed a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to support continued operation of the Clinton Clean Energy Center, a nuclear facility in central Illinois. The deal adds 30 megawatts of firm capacity to the grid, preserves more than 1,100 high-paying jobs and replaces a state subsidy with a market-based solution.

Editorial: It’s time to lift Illinois’ moratorium on new nuclear plants

Illinois is also the nation’s fifth-largest electricity producer and typically sends about one-fifth of the power it generates to other states over the regional grid. Meaning, nuclear energy is not just good for consumers and the environment; it’s also a good revenue source for a state suffering fiscal shortfalls.

Meanwhile, ComEd — the state’s dominant utility — still exerts enormous influence over Illinois’ energy policy. For years, ComEd leveraged its political connections to secure favorable legislation and the ability to charge increased rates, including through the “ComEd Four” bribery scheme. The case ended in the conviction of former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, and the trial exposed how ComEd provided no-show jobs and other favors to win legislative victories worth hundreds of millions in increased profits — and higher bills for consumers.

This history of monopoly power and backroom politics underscores the need to diversify Illinois’ energy market. Lifting the moratorium fully wouldn’t just solve a capacity problem; it also could help break the ComEd-Exelon grip on our power grid. Allowing new companies to build reactors may finally bring new energy providers to Illinois. This could help democratize the state’s energy future, reduce costs for consumers and insulate the state from the kind of energy scandals that have plagued Springfield for decades.

Illinois’ small-reactor exception to its nuclear power plant moratorium was a small step, not a comprehensive energy strategy. With the right policies, nuclear expansion could stabilize the grid, drive billions in investment and create thousands of high-paying jobs. If Illinois is to meet its climate goals, protect consumers, attract and retain businesses and avoid future power shortages, lawmakers must finish the job and lift the moratorium in full.

New York made the leap. It’s time Illinois did, too.

Cleanup crews removed debris from six homes burned in the Eaton and Palisades wildfires and delivered it to local landfills before test results showed the presence of asbestos.

Landfill workers were seen handling the waste without protective gear, and officials didn’t alert landfill operators or regulators about the contamination until weeks later.

Nearly a million tons of disaster debris, likely containing other toxic metals like lead and arsenic, has been sent to Southern California landfills since February.

Key quote:

“It’s the continued failure to effectively protect the public from the ash. This is further evidence of that failure.”

— Jane Williams, executive director of California Communities Against Toxics

Why this matters:

Asbestos, once widely used in construction, breaks down into tiny airborne fibers that, when inhaled, can cause mesothelioma, lung cancer, and other chronic diseases. Wildfire debris often contains asbestos and heavy metals like lead, arsenic, and cadmium, especially when it includes older homes and buildings. When this material is dumped in regular municipal landfills, workers and nearby residents may unknowingly be exposed to airborne toxins, particularly if safety gear isn’t used and safeguards fail. As climate change fuels more intense and frequent wildfires, the scale of debris removal is growing, raising the risk of repeat mistakes. Long-term exposure to such contaminants can harm respiratory health and may contaminate soil, air, and water around landfill sites.

In short:

The Army Corps of Engineers and Interior Department have lost senior staff vital to reviewing environmental permits and enforcing laws like the Endangered Species Act and Clean Water Act, creating a backlog in approvals.

More than 7,500 Interior staff and 15,000 U.S. Department of Agriculture employees have left under Trump administration downsizing initiatives, hollowing out technical capacity as the administration attempts to ramp up mining for critical minerals.

Former and current officials say pressure to approve permits quickly is rising, even as the agencies face understaffing and a steep learning curve for new hires to assess complex environmental impacts.

Key quote:

“We’re losing a lot of talent in this space, or we have already lost [it], and it’s a time of transition … we don’t know exactly what this space is going to look like. We are juggling a lot of hot potatoes right now.”

— Scott Vandegrift, chief environmental review and permitting officer, Department of Agriculture

Why this matters:

Environmental permitting is the backbone of the country’s efforts to protect wetlands, water supplies, wildlife, and public health from the effects of infrastructure and energy development. As seasoned experts leave and permitting offices shrink, the risk grows that reviews will be rushed or incomplete. This matters not just for big-picture climate policy but for communities near construction sites, pipelines, or mines, where the stakes are local and immediate — dirty air, polluted water, and damaged ecosystems. Federal agencies like the Army Corps and Interior aren’t just bureaucracies; they’re the gatekeepers of the nation’s environmental safeguards. Without experienced staff, even well-intentioned reforms risk falling apart.

In short:

The bill expands subsidies for large-scale corn, cotton, and soybean growers by $50 billion and removes climate spending rules attached to funds from the Inflation Reduction Act.

Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could strip food aid from over 22 million households and impose new work rules on parents, veterans, and older adults.

The legislation also boosts funding for immigration enforcement by $100 billion, threatening the labor force that powers U.S. agriculture.

Key quote:

""To me, it’s sending the message that there’s only one way to support farmers, and it’s through increased commodity subsidies for a select few farmers.""

— Mike Lavender, policy director at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition

Why this matters:

By prioritizing subsidies for large industrial farms and diverting funds away from local food systems, rural development, and climate resilience, the new legislation may deepen economic divides and hinder access to healthy food. Cutting SNAP benefits — the country's frontline defense against hunger — while penalizing immigrants, who make up a significant portion of the agricultural workforce, risks worsening both food insecurity and labor shortages. These changes could ripple through the food supply chain, raising prices and making nutritious food even more inaccessible. The environmental trade-offs are stark, too, as land is pulled toward biofuel production at the expense of sustainable farming and climate goals.

In short:

The EU Commission proposed a 90% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, but allowed up to 3% of that to come from international carbon credits, an approach critics say weakens real action.

Some member states, including France, are pushing to delay adoption of the target, citing political pressure and upcoming negotiations over 2035 emissions under the Paris Agreement.

Despite growing populist backlash, polling shows most EU citizens support strong climate action, creating tension between public sentiment and political strategy.

Key quote:

“Carbon credits are a mirage, an accounting trick to let the rich world keep on burning fossil fuels whilst pretending climate change is being tackled somewhere else in the world.”

— Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa

Why this matters:

The EU has long played the role of global climate leader, but its recent move to soften climate goals and allow carbon offsets reflects rising internal divisions and external frustration. This shift comes just months before the COP30 climate summit, where nations must present new emissions plans. Weakening ambition in Europe could undermine international cooperation as climate tipping points loom. Meanwhile, the United States has largely stepped back from climate efforts, and fossil fuel producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia continue to stall progress. What happens in Brussels affects not only European air and water quality, but also the pace of global action. If one of the most important climate leaders falters, it risks dragging down the rest of the world with it.

In short:

The UN’s “Drought Hotspots Around the World” report describes a surge in drought severity from 2023 to 2025, worsened by climate change and El Niño, with some regions seeing record-low water levels and agricultural collapse.

Somalia faces crisis-level food insecurity, and in Eastern Africa, drought conditions drove desperate measures such as forced child marriages and people digging for contaminated water.

Europe and the Americas also suffered: Spain’s olive harvest was halved, endangered Amazonian wildlife died, and Panama Canal shipping slowed due to low water levels.

Key quote:

""Drought is not just a weather event – it can be a social, economic, and environmental emergency.""

— Dr. Kelly Helm Smith, co-author of the report

Why this matters:

Droughts are becoming chronic global stressors that strain public health, ecosystems, and economies. Water scarcity affects everything from crop yields and disease spread to education and migration. As climate change continues to disrupt weather systems, droughts will hit harder and more frequently, especially in places already facing poverty or political instability. Even wealthy nations aren't immune: Europe’s agriculture, the Amazon’s biodiversity, and the Panama Canal’s global trade links all suffered from recent drought. Understanding drought’s reach helps us grasp how climate instability hits not just the environment but the fabric of society.

In short:

A nonprofit analysis found Google’s emissions rose 65% from 2019 to 2024, not the 51% the company reported, and have increased over 1,500% since 2010.

The discrepancy comes from differing emissions accounting methods — Google uses market-based offsets, while researchers used location-based emissions tied to actual grid energy use.

Google’s water use also jumped 27% in a year, reaching 11 billion gallons in 2024, enough to supply Boston and nearby suburbs for nearly two months.

Key quote:

“Google’s own data makes it clear: the corporation is contributing to the acceleration of climate catastrophe, and the metrics that matter – how many emissions they emit, how much water they use, and how fast these trends are accelerating – are headed in the wrong direction for us and the planet.”

— Nicole Sugerman, campaign manager at Kairos Fellowship

Why this matters:

As AI-driven technologies grow, the infrastructure supporting them — particularly large-scale data centers — requires enormous amounts of electricity and water. Even as companies like Google promise net-zero emissions, the reality is far more complex. Much of their reported progress hinges on carbon offsets and projections, not reductions in actual energy use. These facilities often draw power from fossil-fuel-dominated grids and extract water from local sources, which can stress communities already facing climate-related droughts. Rising emissions and water usage challenge the image of tech as a clean industry and show how its expansion may come at the cost of public health, local water supplies, and global climate goals.

From this time last year: Google's emissions soar due to AI energy demands

In short:

Mamdani opposes new natural gas infrastructure, supported the Build Public Renewables Act, and backed Local Law 97 to cut emissions from buildings, which account for nearly two-thirds of citywide emissions.

His “Green Schools” initiative would retrofit 500 schools with renewable energy and cooling systems and create emergency resilience hubs, with a projected cost of $3.27 billion over 10 years.

He links environmental reforms with affordability, backing fare-free bus programs, rent freezes, and a cap on utility bills at 6% of household income, while opposing utility rate hikes.

Key quote:

“Climate and quality of life are not two separate concerns. They are, in fact, one and the same.”

— Zohran Mamdani, Democratic nominee for New York City mayor

Why this matters:

Mamdani’s campaign puts forward a vision that merges green infrastructure with economic relief — connecting renewable energy to rent stabilization, and school retrofits to public health. This approach challenges the assumption that climate policy sits apart from everyday concerns like transit and utility bills. As global temperatures rise and infrastructure ages, urban policy that treats climate resilience as a cost-of-living issue could influence how voters nationwide evaluate local leadership in the years ahead.

Company Secures Option to Acquire 3.7-Acre Industrial Site in Midland, TX for Waste-to-Energy Operations

FAIRFIELD, CA / ACCESS Newswire / July 7, 2025 / Waste Energy Corp (""Waste Energy"" or the ""Company""), (OTCQB:WAST), an emerging leader in sustainable waste-to-energy innovation, today announced it has signed a long-term lease-with an option to purchase nearly four acres of Industrial property in Midland, Texas. The property will host the company's first Waste to Energy conversion system and will serve as the new Waste Energy corporate headquarters.

""Texas generates, refines, and consumes more diesel than any other state in America, giving us unrivaled proximity to feedstock, fuel buyers, and logistics,"" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman & CEO of Waste Energy Corp. ""Our Midland hub puts us at the center of the nation's rising energy needs-driven by the rapid growth of data centers, electric vehicles, and next-generation technologies-at a time when demand for reliable fuel sources are reaching levels not seen in decades. By converting plastic and tire waste into clean-burning (ULSD)ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, we're not just meeting that demand-we're turning one of the world's biggest environmental problems into a powerful energy solution.""

Why Texas? A Century of Fuel Leadership

Historical scale: Texas' 34 refineries can process nearly 6.3 million barrels per day-about one-third of total U.S. capacity.

Top consumer: The state of Texas consumes more ULSD annually than both California and Florida combined, driven by heavy industry, agriculture and freight.

Permian Basin advantage: Midland offers pipeline, rail and interstate access for both incoming waste feedstock and outgoing refined products.

Surging U.S. Power Demand: A Decade of Unprecedented Growth Ahead

The U.S. is entering a new era of energy demand, driven by the explosive growth of data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), Web3 infrastructure, and the reshoring of industrial development:

The U.S. Department of Energy projects data centers alone could consume up to 12% of the nation's electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023.

Goldman Sachs estimates global data center power use will rise by 50% by 2027, fueled by next-gen computing needs.

McKinsey forecasts U.S. data center demand will more than triple to 80 gigawatts by 2030.

In Texas, grid operator ERCOT expects peak power demand to nearly double by 2031, driven by large-scale digital and industrial expansion.

This wave of demand puts enormous pressure on the grid and creates a critical need for reliable backup power and decentralized diesel fuel sources.

WEC domestically produced fuel supports grid resilience, fuels industrial operations, and turns harmful waste into a vital energy solution.

It’s also the site of a growing data center footprint.
And Godfrey hasn’t given up on tax credits as a viable tool at the federal level, either.
“The question is, how do you generate sufficient political will to implement that and defend it?” he told Heatmap.
“The starting point for Republican leadership, it seemed, was completely eliminating the tax credits in this bill.","“This is something that we’re just starting to see,” said Matthew Eisenson, a senior fellow with the Renewable Energy Legal Defense Initiative at the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “It’s one thing for environmentalists to support wind and solar projects if the idea is that those projects will eventually replace coal power plants. But it’s another thing if those projects are purely being built to meet incremental demand from data centers.”

We’ve started to see evidence of this backlash in certain resort towns fearful of a new tech industry presence and the conflicts over transmission lines in Maryland. But it is most prominent in Virginia, ground zero for American hyperscaler data centers. As we’ve previously discussed in The Fight, rural Virginia is increasingly one of the hardest places to get approval for a solar farm in the U.S., and while there are many reasons the industry is facing issues there, a significant one is the state’s data center boom.

I spent weeks digging into the example of Mecklenburg County, where the local Board of Supervisors in May indefinitely banned new solar projects and is rejecting those that were in the middle of permitting when the decision came down. It’s also the site of a growing data center footprint. Microsoft, which already had a base of operations in the county’s town of Boydton, is in the process of building a giant data center hub with three buildings and an enormous amount of energy demand. It’s this sudden buildup of tech industry infrastructure that is by all appearances driving a backlash to renewable energy in the county, a place that already had a pre-existing high opposition risk in the Heatmap Pro database.

It’s not just data centers causing the ban in Mecklenburg, but it’s worth paying attention to how the fight over Big Tech and solar has overlapped in the county, where Sierra Club’s Virginia Chapter has worked locally to fight data center growth with a grassroots citizens group, Friends of the Meherrin River, that was a key supporter of the solar moratorium, too.

In a conversation with me this week, Tim Cywinski, communications director for the state’s Sierra Club chapter, told me municipal leaders like those in Mecklenburg are starting to group together renewables and data centers because, simply put, rural communities enter into conversations with these outsider business segments with a heavy dose of skepticism. This distrust can then be compounded when errors are made, such as when one utility-scale solar farm – Geenex’s Grasshopper project – apparently polluted a nearby creek after soil erosion issues during construction, a problem project operator Dominion Energy later acknowledged and has continued to be a pain point for renewables developers in the county.

“I don’t think the planning that has been presented to rural America has been adequate enough,” the Richmond-based advocate said. “Has solar kind of messed up in a lot of areas in rural America? Yeah, and that’s given those communities an excuse to roll them in with a lot of other bad stuff.”

Cywinski – who describes himself as “not your typical environmentalist” – says the data center space has done a worse job at community engagement than renewables developers in Virginia, and that the opposition against data center projects in places like Chesapeake and Fauquier is more intense, widespread, and popular than the opposition to renewables he’s seeing play out across the Commonwealth.

But, he added, he doesn’t believe the fight against data centers is “mutually exclusive” from conflicts over solar. “I’m not going to tout the gospel of solar while I’m trying to fight a data center for these people because it’s about listening to them, hearing their concerns, and then not telling them what to say but trying to help them elevate their perspective and their concerns,” Cywinski said.

As someone who spends a lot of time speaking with communities resisting solar and trying to best understand their concerns, I agree with Cywinksi: the conflict over data centers speaks to the heart of the rural vs. renewables divide, and it offers a warning shot to anyone thinking AI will help make solar and wind more popular.

Preliminary data from Princeton University’s REPEAT Project (led by Heatmap contributor Jesse Jenkins) forecasts that said bill will have a dramatic effect on the deployment of clean energy in the U.S., including reducing new solar and wind capacity additions by almost over 40 gigawatts over the next five years, and by about 300 gigawatts over the next 10. That would be enough to power 150 of Meta’s largest planned data centers by 2035.

But clean energy development will hardly grind to a halt. While much of the bill’s implementation is in question, the bill as written allows for several more years of tax credit eligibility for wind and solar projects and another year to qualify for them by starting construction. Nuclear, geothermal, and batteries can claim tax credits into the 2030s.

Shares in NextEra, which has one of the largest clean energy development businesses, have risen slightly this year and are down just 6% since the 2024 election. Shares in First Solar, the American solar manufacturer, are up substantially Thursday from a day prior and are about flat for the year, which may be a sign of investors’ belief that buyer demand for solar panels will persist — or optimism that the OBBBA’s punishing foreign entity of concern requirements will drive developers into the company’s arms.

Partisan reversals are hardly new to climate policy. The first Trump administration gleefully pulled the rug from under the Obama administration’s power plant emissions rules, and the second has been thorough so far in its assault on Biden’s attempt to replace them, along with tailpipe emissions standards and mileage standards for vehicles, and of course, the IRA.

Even so, there are ways the U.S. can reduce the volatility for businesses that are caught in the undertow. “Over the past 10 to 20 years, climate advocates have focused very heavily on D.C. as the driver of climate action and, to a lesser extent, California as a back-stop,” Hannah Safford, who was director for transportation and resilience in the Biden White House and is now associate director of climate and environment at the Federation of American Scientists, told Heatmap. “Pursuing a top down approach — some of that has worked, a lot of it hasn’t.”

In today’s environment, especially, where recognition of the need for action on climate change is so politically one-sided, it “makes sense for subnational, non-regulatory forces and market forces to drive progress,” Safford said. As an example, she pointed to the fall in emissions from the power sector since the late 2000s, despite no power plant emissions rule ever actually being in force.

“That tells you something about the capacity to deliver progress on outcomes you want,” she said.

Still, industry groups worry that after the wild swing between the 2022 IRA and the 2025 OBBBA, the U.S. has done permanent damage to its reputation as a business-friendly environment. Since continued swings at the federal level may be inevitable, building back that trust and creating certainty is “about finding ballasts,” Harry Godfrey, the managing director for Advanced Energy United’s federal priorities team, told Heatmap.

The first ballast groups like AEU will be looking to shore up is state policy. “States have to step up and take a leadership role,” he said, particularly in the areas that were gutted by Trump’s tax bill — residential energy efficiency and electrification, transportation and electric vehicles, and transmission.

State support could come in the form of tax credits, but that’s not the only tool that would create more certainty for businesses — considering the budget cuts states will face as a result of Trump’s tax bill, it also might not be an option. But a lot can be accomplished through legislative action, executive action, regulatory reform, and utility ratemaking, Godfrey said. He cited new virtual power plant pilot programs in Virginia and Colorado, which will require further regulatory work to “to get that market right.”

A lot of work can be done within states, as well, to make their deployment of clean energy more efficient and faster. Tyler Norris, a fellow at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment, pointed to Texas’ “connect and manage” model for connecting renewables to the grid, which allows projects to come online much more quickly than in the rest of the country. That’s because the state’s electricity market, ERCOT, does a much more limited study of what grid upgrades are needed to connect a project to the grid, and is generally more tolerant of curtailing generation (i.e. not letting power get to the grid at certain times) than other markets.

“As Texas continues to outpace other markets in generator and load interconnections, even in the absence of renewable tax credits, it seems increasingly plausible that developers and policymakers may conclude that deeper reform is needed to the non-ERCOT electricity markets,” Norris told Heatmap in an email.

At the federal level, there’s still a chance for, yes, bipartisan permitting reform, which could accelerate the buildout of all kinds of energy projects by shortening their development timelines and helping bring down costs, Xan Fishman, senior managing director of the energy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told Heatmap. “Whether you care about energy and costs and affordability and reliability or you care about emissions, the next priority should be permitting reform,” he said.

And Godfrey hasn’t given up on tax credits as a viable tool at the federal level, either. “If you told me in mid-November what this bill would look like today, while I’d still be like, Ugh, that hurts, and that hurts, and that hurts, I would say I would have expected more rollbacks. I would have expected deeper cuts,” he told Heatmap. Ultimately, many of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits will stick around in some form, although we’ve yet to see how hard the new foreign sourcing requirements will hit prospective projects.

While many observers ruefully predicted that the letter-writing moderate Republicans in the House and Senate would fold and support whatever their respective majorities came up with — which they did, with the sole exception of Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick — the bill also evolved over time with input from those in the GOP who are not openly hostile to the clean energy industry.

“You are already seeing people take real risk on the Republican side pushing for clean energy,” Safford said, pointing to Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who opposed the new excise tax on wind and solar added to the Senate bill, which earned her vote after it was removed.

Some damage has already been done, however. Canceled clean energy investments adds up to $23 billion so far this year, compared to just $3 billion in all of 2024, according to the decarbonization think tank RMI. And that’s before OBBBA hits Trump’s desk.

The start-and-stop nature of the Inflation Reduction Act may lead some companies, states, local government and nonprofits to become leery of engaging with a big federal government climate policy again.

“People are going to be nervous about it for sure,” Safford said. “The climate policy of the future has to be polycentric. Even if you have the political opportunity to make a big swing again, people will be pretty gun shy. You will need to pursue a polycentric approach.”

But to Godfrey, all the back and forth over the tax credits, plus the fact that Republicans stood up to defend them in the 11th hour, indicates that there is a broader bipartisan consensus emerging around using them as a tool for certain energy and domestic manufacturing goals. A future administration should think about refinements that will create more enduring policy but not set out in a totally new direction, he said.

Albert Gore, the executive director of the Zero Emissions Transportation Association, was similarly optimistic that tax credits or similar incentives could work again in the future — especially as more people gain experience with electric vehicles, batteries, and other advanced clean energy technologies in their daily lives. “The question is, how do you generate sufficient political will to implement that and defend it?” he told Heatmap. “And that depends on how big of an economic impact does it have, and what does it mean to the American people?”

Ultimately, Fishman said, the subsidy on-off switch is the risk that comes with doing major policy on a strictly partisan basis.

“There was a lot of value in these 10-year timelines [for tax credits in the IRA] in terms of business certainty, instead of one- or two- year extensions,” Fishman told Heatmap. “The downside that came with that is that it became affiliated with one party. It was seen as a partisan effort, and it took something that was bipartisan and put a partisan sheen on it.”

The fight for tax credits may also not be over yet. Before passage of the IRA, tax credits for wind and solar were often extended in a herky-jerky bipartisan fashion, where Democrats who supported clean energy in general and Republicans who supported it in their districts could team up to extend them.

“You can see a world where we have more action on clean energy tax credits to enhance, extend and expand them in a future congress,” Fishman told Heatmap. “The starting point for Republican leadership, it seemed, was completely eliminating the tax credits in this bill. That’s not what they ended up doing.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTA4MzE2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MDQ0NDM3N30.XY1HaFeM-jUgR_p495VRaglILzQi6WAtqujGwjOxMqs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-07-07 07:08:08.362079

Because water is a shared resource, plants often have to deal with dozens of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.
In the last 15 years, Woolf said 68 facilities have voluntarily surrendered their licenses, though most of them were small-scale operations.","Inside the Sault hydro-electric plant in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, 74 turbines are spinning and generating power for thousands of homes in the region.

This narrow plant is a quarter-mile long and its red sandstone bricks harken back to the Gilded Age when the plant first opened in 1902.

“It’s been running pretty much 24/7, 365 since then,” said Roger Line, a director of generation with the Cloverland Electric Cooperative, which owns the plant today.

The newest turbines are 113 years old and run smoothly, but Line said Cloverland considered shutting the plant down.

“If you were to buy the same amount of energy today, you could probably get it cheaper elsewhere,” he said.

Ultimately, the company kept the plant open. Line said it’s not too expensive to run and still generates a reliable flow of energy. Yet this back-and-forth on whether to keep hydro online isn’t uncommon.

A 2022 survey conducted by an engineering consulting firm found that about 36% of hydro operators in the U.S. were actively thinking about decommissioning their facilities.

Operators also noted they were “very concerned” about low energy prices, dam and public safety requirements that raise costs and the long, expensive process of renewing operating licenses.

Federal licensing

Unlike wind or solar projects, hydro facilities require a federal license that must be renewed every 30-50 years. Because water is a shared resource, plants often have to deal with dozens of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.

It can be a bureaucratic nightmare, according to Malcolm Woolf, the president of the National Hydropower Association. He said it takes eight years on average for a facility to relicense, and the process can sometimes drag on for more than a decade.

“Part of what makes the hydropower licensing so maddening, is that there’s no agency in control,” Woolf said. “If one of the dozens of agencies misses its statutory requirements, there’s nothing anyone else can do about it but wait.”

Woolf said licensing should be streamlined. He points out that there is no dispute resolution process if agencies impose different standards, causing projects to “languish.”

“And the requirements can be contradictory — have no more than 2 feet of water for this species. Have no less than 3 feet of water for this other species,” Woolf said. “It's like, well, we can't comply with both.”

The ""Big Beautiful Bill"" that recently passed Congress spared the hydro industry from losing out on tax credits, though a draft version in the U.S. House had initially put them on the chopping block.

In a written statement, Woolf described the legislation as a ""life-saver"" for the hydropower sector.

""The final version of the 'One Big, Beautiful Bill' preserves the full value of the (Inflation Reduction Act) tax credits for hydropower and other water power technologies that begin construction by the end of 2033,"" he said. ""It also maintains elective pay provisions, allowing public power and cooperatives to leverage these credits ... ""

Hydro over the years

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates hydroelectric operations, does not keep track of historical license data, so it’s difficult to know exactly how many hydroelectric facilities have gone offline. In the last 15 years, Woolf said 68 facilities have voluntarily surrendered their licenses, though most of them were small-scale operations.

Most facilities were built in the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, and today the average age is 64 years old.

Caitlin Grady, a civil engineer and associate professor of engineering with the George Washington University, said the overall footprint has generally been stable.

Hydropower still accounts for around 6% of the nation’s electricity generation and supports roughly 25 million Americans.

While the hydro industry may not have the same ambitions for growth like wind and solar, Grady said it’s essential to national energy production, especially if we want to cut down on emissions.

“Without major changes in nuclear or hydro, we will not have a sustainable grid with just solar and wind unless we're also building a ton of batteries,” Grady said, “and I mean, tons and tons and tons of batteries.”

Hydro holds the coveted black start capability that allows operators to quickly restore power in the event of a grid shutdown, which Grady compares to flipping a switch on a fuse box.

“In the event of something happening, whether it’s related to climate change, or terrorists or cyber-hacks, anything, you have to have a way to turn [the grid] back on quickly,” she said.

And no one, Grady said, is pitching new hydro developments that require damming up rivers.

“When we originally built a bunch of dams in the early 1900s, we didn't care a lot about the environment or the people we were harming,” Grady said. “It was an era of building lots of infrastructure without thinking through the consequences.”

Instead, Grady said grid reliability and energy output could be expanded by adding turbines to existing dams or investing in modern pumped storage that uses water and gravity as a battery.

Standing the test of time

People have been using water as a source of power for at least 2,000 years, when water mills would crush grain and break ore. And century-old hydroelectric plants continue to churn out power.

The Keokuk Renewable Center, which sits on the Mississippi River, near Iowa, Illinois and Missouri, has been business as usual since 1913. Brad Todd, with Ameren Missouri, said there’s no plan to decommission Keokuk, which supplies electricity to around 75,000 homes a year.

“It's great for the customers, it's safe, it's efficient and Ameren plans on keeping ours around basically forever if we can,” Todd said.

Todd said Ameren has spent the last decade upgrading its fleet with newer, more energy-efficient turbines.

The Cloverland plant in Michigan is looking to make that switch and eventually start phasing out its old equipment to get the most bang for their buck.

With some equipment dating back 128 years, operators can’t exactly order new parts online. Instead, a small team creates custom parts in a repair shop in the plant.

Line said everyone who works at the plant starts as a technician, to get a feel for the historic facility and its quirks.

“You're carrying that knowledge on to the next person, to the next stage,” he said. “That's how we can maintain a quarter-mile-long building that's over a hundred years old fairly efficiently. So we take a lot of pride in that.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/667f150/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3263x1713+1+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2Fd2%2Fa94777d64462b8d6be362c3aaa5a%2Fhydro-08-19-24-02.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 07:08:12.995986

Couple that with increasing temperatures and the high density of concrete and steel buildings, row houses and lack of green space, and you can see why customers in Baltimore and around the state can expect their bills to go up, on average, $276 per year, or $23 per month.

This increase will be difficult for everyone, but especially for low- and moderate-income households. Many homeowners are exploring alternative energy sources and looking for ways to cut costs, but when a family’s income is low, often so are their options.

Enter Civic Works, a Baltimore-based nonprofit that, according to its website, strengthens “communities for people of all ages through education, skills development and community service.” In partnership with the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development, they operate Baltimore Shines. Since 2015, they’ve been offering free rooftop solar photovoltaic installations to low- and moderate-income Baltimore City residents, while strengthening job opportunities for residents through training and placement in the solar industry.

The program aligns with DHCD’s Vacant Property Prevention Strategy by reducing homeowner costs and creating and supporting sustainable neighborhoods. Once installed, the panels are estimated to eliminate 80 to 100 percent of a family’s electricity bills, while increasing a home’s value, on average, by 4% and helping decrease carbon emissions across the city.

Thanks to a recent influx of funding, Civic Works aims to install solar on 170 homes in the City by the end of its 2026 fiscal year. According to Eli Allen, Senior Program Director, Civic Works, they’ve completed 18 installations and have an additional 91 homes in progress.

Success through a unique operating model

Civic Works’ pre-paid, 20-year lease model eliminates financial risk for homeowners while ensuring they benefit from the savings. They own, operate and maintain each system for a 20-year lease term. The goal is to transfer the lease to the homeowner after that time.

Allen said they “designed the program to benefit from federal funding, but not to rely on federal funding.” Funding includes the Maryland Energy Administration, Baltimore City grants, federal tax credits, the Inflation Reduction Act and Solar Renewable Energy Credits; residents don’t pay anything to participate. As a nonprofit, Civic Works receives the tax credits on behalf of the homeowner and passes the savings to them.

William Gibson is a Baltimore City homeowner who is much happier with his bill from Baltimore Gas & Electric these days. When the panels were installed almost two years ago on his 1925 single-family home in the Forest Park neighborhood of Northwest Baltimore, he watched his electric bill, as high as $300 to $400 per month during the winter, immediately drop to almost zero, outside of taxes and fees.

And it’s been almost zero ever since.

“It was a surprise,” he said. “I’m on a fixed income, and this helps my bottom line tremendously.”

Also helping his bottom line? The refunds he’s received from BGE; he offsets the electricity he buys from BGE with the solar he uses and appreciates that “once a year they pay me something for the overage.”

The installation and activation process, which takes approximately three to six months, starts with a simple energy services application available on the Civic Works website. Applicants must reside in Baltimore, own their home and have a total household income that falls below a threshold set by the number of people in the home.

A Civic Works energy advisor contacts the homeowner to set up a roof assessment and energy audit. If the project moves forward and the assessment uncovers any issues with the roof, Civic Works resolves them at no cost to the homeowner. Opportunities for energy savings discovered during the energy audit, like air leaks, need for insulation, opportunities to switch traditional lightbulbs to LEDs, etc., are integrated into the plan and typically resolved, also at no cost, at the same time at the solar panel installation.

Civic Works manages the program from end to end, including applying for permits, ensuring appropriate connection of the panels to the energy supplier, installing and commissioning the system and applying with the utility company for permission to operate. Once a system is activated, Civic Works maintains it, which includes visiting the installations. Gibson says Civic Works regularly comes to check the condition of his roof and the panels, “especially after storms, and they make any repairs at no cost.”

Training the next generation of solar installers

Installations are completed through a combination of local contractors and installers enrolled in Civic Works solar training program. In addition to providing paid on-the-job experience, the three-month workforce development program for Baltimore residents includes OSHA and site assessment training and hands-on solar construction training in the Civic Works Solar Construction lab. Graduates leave with the technical skills they need and are prepared to work in the solar industry.

Civic Works uses its network of contacts to place graduates into full-time roles; to date, it has placed 174 students who continue to progress in the field. “The goal is to connect everyone who graduates with opportunities” Allen said.

They have strong partners across the region who employ graduates in both Civic Works and other solar projects and roles. “We’ve seen graduates progress into crew leader, project management and management positions,” he explained, “and see them continue in solar years after graduation.”

A bright future for Baltimore City residents

Civic Works anticipates that the 170 solar installations will save city residents over $200k annually and reduce emissions by over 700 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. When they set the goal of 170, Allen explained, it was with the idea that they wanted to surpass it.

“It was both an ambitious and realistic goal, but we want to continue to raise funding,” he explained, “To ultimately complete as many roof replacements and repairs as possible and ensure this can be part of a comprehensive, potentially transformational project for homeowners in Baltimore City.”",https://thedailyrecord.com/files/2025/07/Baltimore-Shines-web.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 12:26:45.900069

Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.

The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.

“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”

Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.

In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”

The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.

But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.

“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.

In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.

In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.

Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.

Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.

“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”

But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.

“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”

Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.

“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”

Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.

Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.

Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”

The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.

The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.

The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.

“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”

Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.

‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.

Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?

“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”

Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.

“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”

Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.

“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nuclear-three-mile-island.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:27:54.464468

Others, like the Sierra Club, argue that putting money into aging coal plants ends up costing consumers.","In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the ""greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen.""

The three plants of concern are Duke Energy's Gibson coal plant in Gibson County; CenterPoint's Energy F.B. Culley Plant; and the Warrick Aluminum Smelting Plant.

EVANSVILLE — Evansville has long been called a ""sacrifice zone"" due to nearby pollution hazards, and the current attitude of federal leaders toward environmental safeguards has local advocates concerned.

Nicole Chandler, Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign organizer for Southwest Indiana, said there isn't one specific regulation the Environmental Protection Agency's could roll back that would be bad for the area. Instead, she said, rolling back any of them would be detrimental.

""These environmental protections are put into place to protect us,"" Chandler said. ""So when the administration is signaling they want to roll them back, that shows to us that they don't care about clean air and clean water.""

In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the ""greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen."" He said the regulations of administrations under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had ""suffocated"" the economy.

""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" he said.

His announcement included plans to change regulations around power plants, the oil and gas industry, mercury and air toxics standards, the Regional Haze Rule and the Good Neighbor Plan.

The Good Neighbor Plan aims to make sure 23 states, including Indiana, meet the Clean Air Act’s “Good Neighbor” requirements by reducing pollution. The Regional Haze Rule calls for state and federal agencies to work together to improve visibility in 156 national parks and wilderness areas. The closest location included in the rule is Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky.

The Good Neighbor Plan is not currently in effect; it was put on hold by the Supreme Court in 2024.

""Even one rule or regulation getting rolled back will have a harmful impact on our community,"" Chandler said. ""You know it's just not coal plants around us, it's the coal plants that are across the river too. Pollution doesn't stay in one place. It travels, so that's the concern we have.""

Neighboring coal plants a concern for Sierra Club

Chandler said the three coal plants of concern are Duke Energy's Gibson coal plant in Gibson County; CenterPoint's Energy F.B. Culley Plant; and the Warrick Aluminum Smelting Plant.

CenterPoint's Culley Plant is a current concern for Sierra Club organizers because it was the utility said it would be coal-free by 2027, but in its current 20-year planning process, that is being potentially pushed back to 2030.

F.B. Culley Unit 3 was set to convert to natural gas by 2027, but meeting minutes from the most recent planning session state CenterPoint is considering other options.

These include a conversion to natural gas by 2030, retirement by 2032, or co-fire by 2030 and retirement by 2039.

While these three are the main focuses of concern, Chandler argues that any coal plant near in the area is bad.

""A lot of these are really old and uneconomic plants and they just have such detrimental health impacts,"" she said.

In January, Duke Energy officials, along with other power companies, sent a letter to Zeldin asking incoming President Donald Trump's administration to rollback regulations on areas of their work.

In the letter, Duke Energy states it wants ""swift and sustained"" action by the Trump Administration, and that recent changes by the EPA have resulted ""in significant burdens on the nation’s power sector without tangible benefits.""

""These regulations, individually and collectively, threaten the reliability of the power grid, jeopardize national security, are a drag on economic growth, increase inflation, and hinder the expansion of electric power generation to support the critical development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence and related technologies,"" the letter states.

In particular, Duke called for attention to the regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and coal combustion residuals.

""The new administration should decline to defend these unlawful rules and should seek their immediate recission,"" the letter states.

Additionally, the letter states issue with the Good Neighbor Plan and Effluent Limitations Guidelines for power plants. Effluent limitation guidelines are national regulatory standards for wastewater discharged to surface waters and municipal sewage treatment plants.

""These other recent rules, like the GHG and CCR rules, do not further EPA’s statutory mission to protect human health and the environment"" the letter states, ""and instead will result in unnecessary costs on the power sector, impacting the affordability and reliability of electricity.""

Concerns are in both the air and water

Chandler said the health impacts from potential rule changes are not just focused on air quality or water pollution. Both are concerns in this area of the state.

""We just have really poor air quality here,"" Chandler said. ""And you know, I think it's kind of telling that there are lots of restrictions around how much fish you can even eat out of the Ohio River.""

In May, Sierra Club rolled out a new dashboard that it states show the impact rollbacks to EPA standards on coal pollution would have on the U.S.

The dashboard estimates if effluent limitation guidelines were upheld, the F.B. Culley plant would release more than 14,000 tons less in wastewater pollution than if they are rolled back.

If the Regional Haze Act stays intact, the release of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides from the Warrick County plant would be reduced by 75% and 47% respectively, as estimated by the Sierra Club.

Nitrogen oxides are the mixture of gases composed of nitrogen and oxygen. Most significant are nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust, burning coal, oil, or natural gas, and during processes such as arc welding and electroplating. Sulfur dioxide is a gas composed of sulfur and oxygen. Sulfur dioxide forms when sulfur-containing fuel such as coal, petroleum oil or diesel is burned.

According to the American Lung Association, long-term exposure to high levels of sulfur dioxide increases respiratory symptoms and reduces the ability of the lungs to function. Short-term exposure can make it difficult for those with asthma to breathe outdoors.

State leaders signal desire to roll back environmental regulations

On July 1, Gov. Mike Braun and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management announced a plan that identified regulations to be changed.

“Government naturally drifts toward over-regulation, and it’s important to go through these regulations to make sure they aren’t stifling innovation an raising the cost of living for no benefit,"" Braun stated in a news release. ""My agencies have been directed to identify regulations that are raising the cost of living without benefiting our environment so they can be changed or rescinded; we can grow our economy while also safeguarding Hoosiers’ health and preserving our natural resources.”

In March, Braun signed an executive order that Indiana would not make rules on environmental regulations that surpassed those at the federal level. It directed agencies to identify state regulations that were ""unduly burdensome, significantly raise the cost of living for Hoosiers, are not supported by current law and the best available science, or do not benefit Indiana’s environment.""

In the July 1 report, IDEM and Braun recommended 10 regulations to be changed or rescinded. The report also contained examples of the how IDEM will work with the federal government in an effort to pursue reforms that enact Braun's executive order supporting extensions for using coal to generate power.

""For example, EPA took a recent action to ensure that Indiana energy producers were not unnecessary penalized under federal air quality requirements for keeping coal-fired power plants open,"" the report states. ""Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana recently announced a settlement, aligned with Governor Braun’s energy-related executive orders, to evaluate the continued operation of coal units at its Cayuga Generating Station in Vermillion County.""

The IndyStar recently reported on that Duke settlement.

High utility costs plague Evansville residents

In Evansville, high utility costs are top of mind for residents.

In a January executive order, Trump blamed environmental regulations for those high costs.

""America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our nation’s economic prosperity. In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of these resources, limited the generation of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens,"" the order states. ""These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security.""

Others, like the Sierra Club, argue that putting money into aging coal plants ends up costing consumers.

""We need to understand, too, that the environmental impacts of coal have a cost,"" Chandler said. ""There are cleanup costs associated with that, there are health costs associated with that.""

At the end of the day, it's not the regulations making costs ""so incredibly high"" in the area, Chandler argues.

""It's because these monopoly utilities keep throwing money into this aging, uneconomic, polluting source of energy generation that is harming out health and wealth down here,"" Chandler said.","https://www.courierpress.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/02/PEVC/84445213007-fb-culley-31.JPG?crop=4193,2359,x0,y218&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-07 07:08:16.958744

This landmark investment, sourced from the EU’s Emissions Trading System via the Innovation Fund, marks a major step in Europe’s push to become a global leader in EV battery production.

As demand for electric vehicles surges and the world shifts away from fossil fuels, the EU is doubling down on homegrown innovation to reduce emissions, boost competitiveness, and reduce reliance on imported technology.

Commenting on the funding, Wopke Hoekstra, Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, said: “The €852m investment in European EV battery manufacturing delivers on our goals to increase competitiveness and support pioneering decarbonisation technologies.

“With each Innovation Fund call, we’re demonstrating the key role of the EU Emissions Trading System in making our industry innovative and fit for the future.

“This first call dedicated to batteries shows we are committed to delivering on the Industrial Action Plan for the European Automotive Sector.

“We want the EU battery manufacturing to thrive thanks to innovative, clean technologies that will get us closer to materialising the clean industrial transition.”

Funding sparks a continental battery charge

The grants are the result of the EU’s first dedicated Battery Call, launched in December 2024 under the Innovation Fund.

Of 14 submissions from eight countries, six projects were chosen after rigorous evaluation by independent experts.

Selection criteria focused on innovation, GHG emissions reduction, technical and financial readiness, replicability, cost-efficiency, and strategic contributions to EU supply chain resilience.

These projects, aligned with the Clean Industrial Deal and the Industrial Action Plan for the European auto sector, are part of a broader €3bn EU initiative to fortify Europe’s battery ecosystem.

Six projects to lead the charge

The six selected projects, which will all begin operations before 2030, are:

ACCEPT: Automotive Cells Company’s European Production Take-off (France)

AGATHE: Verkor’s advanced gigafactory to temper GHG emissions (France)

CF3_at_Scale: Cellforce Group’s high-performance manufacturing scale-up (Germany)

NOVO One: NOVO Energy’s gigafactory project (Sweden)

WGF2G: Leclanché’s 2 GWh Willstatt GigaFactory (Germany)

46inEU: LG Energy Solution’s cylinder cell production expansion (Poland)

Together, these projects will add an annual production capacity of roughly 56 GWh of EV battery cells and are forecast to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 91 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent over their first decade.

Innovation meets sustainability

Beyond boosting output, the selected initiatives prioritise sustainability and cutting-edge EV battery manufacturing.

Each project will integrate next-generation technologies and sustainable processes, contributing to the EU’s broader climate neutrality objectives.

These gigafactories are not just assembly lines – they’re hubs of innovation focused on reducing the carbon footprint of both the batteries and the manufacturing process.

Support will cover both capital and operational expenditures, with phased disbursement linked to project milestones, including some funding made available pre-operation to spur construction and setup phases.

Why EU battery manufacturing matters

The ramp-up in EV battery manufacturing is a strategic necessity. As the global race for clean energy technology intensifies, Europe’s reliance on imported battery cells, primarily from Asia, presents economic and geopolitical vulnerabilities.

By investing in domestic EV battery production, the EU reduces its dependency on external suppliers, secures supply chains, and protects its auto industry from future disruptions.

Moreover, this initiative positions Europe as a leader in clean technology and advanced manufacturing, fostering high-quality jobs and driving regional economic growth.

Strengthening homegrown battery production also ensures the continent can meet the surging demand for EVs, driven by tightening emissions regulations and growing consumer adoption.

Without a robust internal battery supply, Europe risks falling behind in the transition to sustainable transport.

Road ahead for EU battery production

Grant agreements between project leaders and the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA) are expected to be finalised in Q3 2025.

As construction and development begin, these projects will serve as cornerstones of Europe’s push toward industrial decarbonisation, innovation, and economic resilience.

When radical environmental groups denounce the United States’ use of fossil fuels, they often romanticize countries attempting to wean themselves from coal, oil and natural gas as models for us to follow.

But the reality is that these resources remain vital to America’s national and economic security, and the only ones more eager than green groups to end our country’s energy development are geopolitical rivals like Russia and China.

For a world power like the United States, policies that restrict the production and use of our God-given natural resources would hand a strategic and economic advantage to authoritarian regimes. Unfortunately, environmental zealots don’t seem to understand this inherent problem with their agenda. Or worse, they simply don’t care.

Take, for example, Greenpeace, which was recently ordered to pay $667 million to the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline following its campaign of deception and destruction.

PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PURSUING ENERGY DOMINANCE — CONGRESS SHOULDN'T GET IN THE WAY

What Greenpeace and other extremist groups don’t grasp is that their efforts to stop oil and natural gas development would weaken the United States, embolden rogue nations, hurt our economy and have very little, if any, impact on the environment.

Making the United States more dependent on renewable energy would make the U.S. electricity grid less reliable and threaten the nation’s economy. Spain is a pertinent example.

In April, the country bragged that for the first time, it was running on 100% renewable energy. Later that month, a grid failure created a nationwide blackout that risked lives and cost the country nearly a half-billion dollars.

Generating electricity solely through renewables makes electric grids more prone to collapse, and requires incredibly expensive upgrades to energy infrastructure that leads to higher electricity prices for consumers.

THE PREDICTABLE OUTCOME OF CALIFORNIA’S GREEN ENERGY POLICIES HAS ARRIVED AND IT'S A DISASTER

The International Energy Agency found that for every 10% increase in the portion of electricity generated by renewables, costs go up by more than 4 cents per kilowatt hour. As a result, countries like Germany pay more than 2.5 times the average electricity rate than the United States, and over four times higher than China.

When countries like China or Russia can generate electricity more cheaply than their democratic rivals, they gain an important economic advantage. China’s coal consumption reached record highs last year, and its buildout of new coal power plants reached the highest level of construction in the last 10 years. Russia is the world’s second-largest exporter of natural gas and holds natural gas reserves that rival the U.S.

When it comes to the environment, these countries are not extracting or using fossil fuels with the same care as American companies. In fact, the largest carbon emitter in the world by a long shot is China. In 2020, China’s emissions exceeded those of all other developed nations combined. As China and Russia continue to develop their fossil fuel resources, it will be essential that the United States do the same.

Groups like Greenpeace may continue their efforts to derail American fossil fuel projects, but policymakers should recognize that this agenda would have little impact on the environment and a lasting and damaging impact on both U.S. national security and economic competitiveness.

To protect the environment and preserve our democratic values, the United States must pursue an energy policy rooted in realism, not ideology. While environmental activism has a place in shaping a sustainable future, radical efforts to dismantle fossil fuel development ignore a critical truth – energy security is national security.

Abandoning domestic oil and gas production would not reduce global emissions, it would only hand a strategic advantage to those who pollute more, care less and gain power when democracies self-sabotage.

According to the Nikkei report, Honda has only halted work on the seven-seater electric SUV for now.
“However, Honda will proceed with introducing its flagship sedan and midsize SUV models, for which prototype vehicles have already been unveiled,” the article states.
Production was planned not in Japan but in the US – at the Honda Marysville Auto Plant in Ohio.","The decision to stop development of the large SUV planned for 2027 was influenced by weakening demand and potential further delays in its introduction due to political factors in the US, the company’s key market, according to Japanese newspaper Nikkei. This refers to EV subsidies that were ended by President Trump and will expire at the end of September 2025.

Honda had initially planned to launch a range of new electric vehicles from 2026, targeting markets outside China – where the Japanese carmaker’s joint ventures follow their own model strategy. By 2030, the new EV line-up, known as the ‘0 Series’, was to grow to seven models – including the seven-seater electric SUV planned for 2027, aimed at families and customers requiring substantial interior space. Such five-metre-class vehicles are particularly popular in the US. “Concerns about potential sales volume constraints could exert financial pressure on company operations,” Nikkei reported.

With the outlook for EV demand in the US now uncertain following recent political decisions, Honda has, as per the report, stopped the project for the large SUV model. However, even before the decision to end EV tax credits in the US, Honda had begun to scale back its electrification investments. In April 2024, the company paused its multi-billion-dollar investment plans to establish an EV hub in Canada, and only days later, it scaled down its entire development roadmap – with a shift in focus towards new hybrid models, which can be flexibly manufactured alongside EVs on the same production line.

According to the Nikkei report, Honda has only halted work on the seven-seater electric SUV for now. “However, Honda will proceed with introducing its flagship sedan and midsize SUV models, for which prototype vehicles have already been unveiled,” the article states. No information is provided on the other four models announced as part of the new EV line-up.

The prototypes mentioned were revealed at CES in Las Vegas in January 2025, including a wedge-shaped premium saloon and a mid-size SUV – both featuring striking design language.

However, under Trump, signals quickly emerged that the EV tax credit had no future.","US President Donald Trump signed his tax reform and spending package (‘The One Big Beautiful Bill’) into law on 4 July, following approval from both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This seals the end of EV subsidies as of 30 September – in just under three months. The current tax credit of $7,500 applies to households buying or leasing a new electric vehicle, while a $4,000 tax credit is available to buyers of used EVs.

These and other soon-to-expire environmental tax incentives had been extended or modified under the Inflation Reduction Act, a law introduced in 2022 by former President Joe Biden. For example, the Biden administration expanded EV tax credits in 2022 to include leased vehicles and removed the manufacturer cap, which had previously disqualified OEMs once they sold more than 200,000 EVs.

The new bill also ends the ‘Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit’ on 30 June 2026 instead of 31 December 2032. Just a reminder, the credit is currently available “to businesses and individuals who install qualified refueling or recharging property, including electric vehicle charging equipment, in an eligible location.”

Under the previous administration’s plans, these tax incentives were expected to remain in place for around seven more years, until at least 2032. However, under Trump, signals quickly emerged that the EV tax credit had no future. Competing proposals within Congress recently debated when exactly to end the subsidy. With the agreed date of 30 September, lawmakers in both chambers have opted for the earliest possible deadline.

An earlier draft passed by the House in May had envisaged a phased withdrawal by the end of 2026, while the Senate in mid-June proposed ending tax credits for new vehicles 180 days (around six months) after the law took effect – roughly at the turn of the year.

In fact, some optimistic estimates forecast that electric cars could make up 50% of all vehicle sales in the United States by 2030.

There are many factors contributing to this massive surge in popularity, but rapidly developing technology is certainly helping. One such mind-blowing innovation was just announced in the field of electric car batteries.

A United Kingdom-based company, RML Group, just unveiled its VarEVolt battery pack, according to Interesting Engineering. Incredibly, the battery pack touts the ability to be fully charged in just 18 seconds. In even better news, the quickly charging battery pack also allows the cars to drive long ranges at high speeds.

And this is only the latest incredible technological breakthrough in the field of electric vehicles and batteries. 24M Technologies recently unveiled a car battery that can provide 1,000 miles on a single charge. And researchers at the National University of Singapore are developing a battery that lasts 10 years longer than current ones.

These types of technological innovations help take away some of the fears of switching to electric cars. Quick-charging batteries with long ranges operate just as good as traditional gas guzzlers without the negative effects.

Electric vehicles are great for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, they save consumers money. Drivers don't have to spend their hard-earned cash on expensive gasoline. The maintenance requirements are much cheaper than traditional combustion engine vehicles.

The environmental benefits are also substantial. Traditional vehicles burn gasoline, which releases lots of pollution into the atmosphere. This leads to rising temperatures around the globe and health threats to all living things. But since electric vehicles don't burn gas, they help cut down on air pollution.

One way to reduce your environmental footprint is by charging your electric vehicles using solar power. This will also significantly reduce your charging costs. And it is now easier than ever to install solar panels thanks to EnergySage. Its free online tool provides quotes from vetted contractors so that consumers can make the best personal decision.

The VarEVolt battery is now being prepped for mass production. RML Group also plans to work on a conversion kit so that their batteries can be used in older vehicles.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VarEVoltimage-recpvkCqhJ38vYa1F.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 09:16:34.829709

It sounds like Florida is maybe ahead of other states in terms of clean-energy projects, particularly solar.
Do you believe that the state's clean-energy industry can survive the rollback of these tax credits?","The so-called ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" is now law, signed by President Donald Trump on Friday.

The measure pushes through an extension of Trump's first-term tax cuts and adds new tax breaks, some that overturn clean-energy components of former President Joe Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

So, how will the new law affect clean-energy projects in Florida?

The law does away with tax incentives that have paid for nearly a third of the cost of installing solar panels. Advocates are concerned this could threaten the viability of nine clean-energy factories and over 10,000 jobs in Florida. It could also raise the price of buying an electric vehicle.

WUSF's Steve Newborn talked about its implications with Maggie Shober and Stan Cross of the advocacy group Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

The interview was conducted before the bill was signed. It has been lightly edited for clarity.

WUSF: How would the rollback of these clean-energy credits affect Florida, and particularly solar panel providers, here in the state?

SHOBER: This so-called ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" is going to be big and bad for the solar industry. It is changing the calculus for electric utilities that have already planned solar, which most in Florida have solar projects in the works that now will cost more.

And in a situation like we have in Florida and other parts of the country, where electric utilities are experiencing low-growth solar – even without tax credits – it's going to be the best option to meet that load growth.

We just can't get gas turbines in time. Florida does not produce gas and has somewhat limited pipelines to get gas into the state. So the solar that needs to get built will cost more, and that will mean people's electric bills will go up.

When you say the cost of solar panels, for instance, will go up, can you give me a rough estimate of how much for the average house?

SHOBER: So the tax credits for homes that wanted to put solar on their roofs were for about 30 percent of the cost. So now households will pay, you know, 100 percent of those costs instead of that, about 70 or so percent.

Is there a timeline on this bill would take effect immediately upon passage?

SHOBER: There's a couple of different timelines for different resources. Some phase out at the end of this year. Some have provisions put into the Senate bill that they would need to start construction by the end of next year.

So there's a little bit of flexibility for some projects, nuclear and geothermal and sort of longer lead time, projects have all the way until 2033, but for solar and wind and storage, those are nearer-term deadlines.

So if you want to put solar panels on your roof, for instance, or put up a wind turbine, do it now, right?

SHOBER: Yes, absolutely. Get on it quickly. I think the lines are already pretty long.

There was a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association. It said that nine clean-energy factories in Florida are at risk of closing or never opening if this bill passes. Is that what you're seeing as well? Or do you have different numbers than that?

SHOBER: Yes, that is what we're seeing. So in addition to tax credits that encouraged both households and businesses and utilities to install solar, there are also tax credits to encourage clean energy to manufacture here in the U.S., and so those are going away as well.

I've read that there are also 10,000 jobs in Florida directly tied to clean energy. What kind of numbers can you give us?

SHOBER: It kind of depends on how you define clean energy, whether that includes, you know, energy efficiency, or electrification, electric vehicles, and all those things as well. But these are pretty broad and well-established sectors here in the Southeast. So that seems low to me for Florida. So I think it's probably much, much more than that.

How would this bill affect sales of electric vehicles?

CROSS: The bill will also impact electric vehicles by eliminating credits for purchasing new and used EVs. So you know that's big in Florida, because Florida is now No. 1 in the Southeast for EV sales and the second biggest state in the country for EV sales. So that market is thriving, and it's a shame to sort of try to take out some of that momentum. At the same time, the electric horse might have already left the barn in Florida.

There are so many EVs on the road, and drivers are so satisfied with those electric vehicles. There's also a hope that market momentum will persist, even despite the efforts of this bill to slow it down.

It sounds like Florida is maybe ahead of other states in terms of clean-energy projects, particularly solar. Do you believe that the inflation Reduction Act accomplished its mission of jump-starting the businesses, especially here in Florida, and maybe we don't need the tax credits so much anymore?

CROSS: The Inflation Reduction Act set market conditions in a favorable way for the clean-energy sector, and that clean-energy sector was just getting going.

And what this bill does is inject a whole lot of uncertainty into the market. And if there's one thing business does not like, it's uncertainty. So the impact of this bill – it's unknown at this point – but it could be catastrophic by removing those incentives just as the private sector was making good on their investments and job growth.

Do you believe that the state's clean-energy industry can survive the rollback of these tax credits?

SHOBER: I think that the economy can survive. I think there's some questions as to whether or not it will thrive. I think that one thing that we've seen, any sort of student of economics can talk about, is that certainty is really important when you are planning for your business, planning for your future, or when you know households are planning house projects or the like.

So I think that you know that, for better or worse, the solar industry, and renewable industry more broadly, has seen a history of tax credits come and go and shift and change. And unfortunately, you know, these are the policies that have been politically amenable, instead of what I see as really an ability to make the playing field more even.

We're giving these incentives to the clean-energy industry, but we're not taking away the inherent incentives of fossil fuels. And if we were to do that, then I think that the tax credits for clean energy would be less necessary.

This is the political world we live in, and this is the way that our federal government has decided to do clean- energy policy. And so I think that it is potentially catastrophic. I don't think solar companies will all disappear overnight, but I think that we as a country – and the Southeast and Florida in particular – will be set back because of these policies. There's absolutely no doubt about that.

Anything else that you would all like to mention?

CROSS: The clean-energy incentives that this bill seeks to roll back were put in place to create a level playing field in the energy economy. The fossil fuel industry is arguably one of the most subsidized industries in our entire economy, and these incentives, over time, have created a robust clean-energy economy that may be durable enough to withstand these changes, but that's the wrong question.

This is an economy that is creating jobs, that is creating a global competitive advantage for our country in an energy sector that is growing worldwide. For America to lose our global energy leadership is foolish. This is the biggest gift we could ever have given to China and other countries that are already outcompeting us in many global markets.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/59e66cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/650x341+0+12/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2F3b%2F69ce0a5146bd99f299be7db3421e%2Ftrenton-solar-2106-duke.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 06:06:51.475091

In the last 15 years, Woolf said 68 facilities have voluntarily surrendered their licenses, though most of them were small-scale operations.","Inside the Sault hydro-electric plant in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, 74 turbines are spinning and generating power for thousands of homes in the region.

This narrow plant is a quarter-mile long and its red sandstone bricks harken back to the Gilded Age when the plant first opened in 1902.

“It’s been running pretty much 24/7, 365 since then,” said Roger Line, a director of generation with the Cloverland Electric Cooperative, which owns the plant today.

The newest turbines are 113 years old and run smoothly, but Line said Cloverland considered shutting the plant down.

“If you were to buy the same amount of energy today, you could probably get it cheaper elsewhere,” he said.

Ultimately, the company kept the plant open. Line said it’s not too expensive to run and still generates a reliable flow of energy. Yet this back-and-forth on whether to keep hydro online isn’t uncommon.

A 2022 survey conducted by an engineering consulting firm found that about 36% of hydro operators in the U.S. were actively thinking about decommissioning their facilities.

Operators also noted they were “very concerned” about low energy prices, dam and public safety requirements that raise costs and the long, expensive process of renewing operating licenses.

Federal licensing

Unlike wind or solar projects, hydro facilities require a federal license that must be renewed every 30-50 years. Because water is a shared resource, plants often have to deal with dozens of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.

It can be a bureaucratic nightmare, according to Malcolm Woolf, the president of the National Hydropower Association. He said it takes eight years on average for a facility to relicense, and the process can sometimes drag on for more than a decade.

“Part of what makes the hydropower licensing so maddening, is that there’s no agency in control,” Woolf said. “If one of the dozens of agencies misses its statutory requirements, there’s nothing anyone else can do about it but wait.”

Woolf said licensing should be streamlined. He points out that there is no dispute resolution process if agencies impose different standards, causing projects to “languish.”

“And the requirements can be contradictory — have no more than 2 feet of water for this species. Have no less than 3 feet of water for this other species,” Woolf said. “It's like, well, we can't comply with both.”

The ""Big Beautiful Bill"" that recently passed Congress spared the hydro industry from losing out on tax credits, though a draft version in the U.S. House had initially put them on the chopping block.

In a written statement, Woolf described the legislation as a ""life-saver"" for the hydropower sector.

""The final version of the 'One Big, Beautiful Bill' preserves the full value of the (Inflation Reduction Act) tax credits for hydropower and other water power technologies that begin construction by the end of 2033,"" he said. ""It also maintains elective pay provisions, allowing public power and cooperatives to leverage these credits ... ""

Hydro over the years

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates hydroelectric operations, does not keep track of historical license data, so it’s difficult to know exactly how many hydroelectric facilities have gone offline. In the last 15 years, Woolf said 68 facilities have voluntarily surrendered their licenses, though most of them were small-scale operations.

Most facilities were built in the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, and today the average age is 64 years old.

Caitlin Grady, a civil engineer and associate professor of engineering with the George Washington University, said the overall footprint has generally been stable.

Hydropower still accounts for around 6% of the nation’s electricity generation and supports roughly 25 million Americans.

While the hydro industry may not have the same ambitions for growth like wind and solar, Grady said it’s essential to national energy production, especially if we want to cut down on emissions.

“Without major changes in nuclear or hydro, we will not have a sustainable grid with just solar and wind unless we're also building a ton of batteries,” Grady said, “and I mean, tons and tons and tons of batteries.”

Hydro holds the coveted black start capability that allows operators to quickly restore power in the event of a grid shutdown, which Grady compares to flipping a switch on a fuse box.

“In the event of something happening, whether it’s related to climate change, or terrorists or cyber-hacks, anything, you have to have a way to turn [the grid] back on quickly,” she said.

And no one, Grady said, is pitching new hydro developments that require damming up rivers.

“When we originally built a bunch of dams in the early 1900s, we didn't care a lot about the environment or the people we were harming,” Grady said. “It was an era of building lots of infrastructure without thinking through the consequences.”

Instead, Grady said grid reliability and energy output could be expanded by adding turbines to existing dams or investing in modern pumped storage that uses water and gravity as a battery.

Standing the test of time

People have been using water as a source of power for at least 2,000 years, when water mills would crush grain and break ore. And century-old hydroelectric plants continue to churn out power.

The Keokuk Renewable Center, which sits on the Mississippi River, near Iowa, Illinois and Missouri, has been business as usual since 1913. Brad Todd, with Ameren Missouri, said there’s no plan to decommission Keokuk, which supplies electricity to around 75,000 homes a year.

“It's great for the customers, it's safe, it's efficient and Ameren plans on keeping ours around basically forever if we can,” Todd said.

Todd said Ameren has spent the last decade upgrading its fleet with newer, more energy-efficient turbines.

The Cloverland plant in Michigan is looking to make that switch and eventually start phasing out its old equipment to get the most bang for their buck.

With some equipment dating back 128 years, operators can’t exactly order new parts online. Instead, a small team creates custom parts in a repair shop in the plant.

Line said everyone who works at the plant starts as a technician, to get a feel for the historic facility and its quirks.

""So, what is the impact to your agency?,"" Terlaje asked.
We could not function without those federal grants to support not only salaries, but operations,"" Lastimoza responded.
You're going to lose $3.89 million, your entire federal funding for Guam EPA?,"" Terlaje reconfirmed.
Meanwhile, local officials have said they are still weighing the impact to Guam of sweeping budget cuts under the new federal budget law.","In a huge financial blow to the Guam Environmental Protection Agency, the fiscal year 2026 federal budget law, or the One Big Beautiful Bill, that was signed last week by President Donald Trump, removed $3.89 million in grant funding from the Guam Environmental Protection Agency that covers 85% of its overall operational expenses.

GEPA Administrator Michelle Lastimoza acknowledged that the funding loss ""would literally eliminate our agency's operations and functions altogether.""

Lastimoza was testifying on Monday at a public hearing on a separate local bill, but disclosed the cuts under questioning by Sen. Therese Terlaje.

""So, what is the impact to your agency?,"" Terlaje asked.

""That would impact almost all of the agency. We could not function without those federal grants to support not only salaries, but operations,"" Lastimoza responded.

""So you're saying the $3.89 (million) is all you receive, there's no other funding that Guam EPA is getting?,"" Terlaje reiterated.

""That's our federal consolidated grant money, and then we get about $800,000 from the general fund,"" said Lastimoza.

""So no other federal grants are coming through? ... This is for sure now. You're going to lose $3.89 million, your entire federal funding for Guam EPA?,"" Terlaje reconfirmed.

""Correct,"" Lastimoza said.

""That's huge, and honestly, that's the first time I'm hearing that,"" Terlaje said.

Lastimoza said GEPA has money in its account under a five-year $45 million Emerging Contaminants, Small Disadvantaged Communities grant.

She said GEPA already received funding for three of the five years, so it has about $26 million left on account.

""We have talked to our federal granters about maybe redirecting those moneys if it becomes necessary, but we haven't crossed that bridge yet. That money is supposed to help build our new laboratory, but more importantly, provide laboratory services for emerging contaminants in our drinking water,"" Lastimoza said.

""We do have money in our account that will last us maybe a good three or four years,"" she said.

But Lastimoza acknowledged they haven't had any formal discussion about the FY26 budget impact, ""and whether or not we have approval or authorization to redirect any of that money towards salaries.""

Lastimoza said they have been in discussions with the U.S. EPA's Guam program manager as well as the deputy administrator for Region 9, which oversees Guam.

But Sen. Shawn Gumataotao said, ""Are they still in business? Because I heard all Region 9 is pretty much gone.""

""Well, in our regional office, I know of 16 people that were released. And again, those positions that I mentioned that we've had discussions with, they are still there today,"" Lastimoza said.

""That is a lot of mandates that needs their support or their visibility. ... I'm hoping that following the hearing you will engage immediately,"" Gumataotao said, ""and let the committee chair know that you've already had a formal meeting. And I would strongly suggest even getting him involved.""

Meanwhile, local officials have said they are still weighing the impact to Guam of sweeping budget cuts under the new federal budget law.

Guam Del. James Moylan's office is also reviewing the impacts and said last week that it is preparing a report for release to the public.

Lastimoza appeared at the Guam Congress Building on Monday to testify on Sen. Sabina Perez's Bill 132-38, which would modernize the Environmental Trust Fund ""by expanding authorized uses, removing caps to increase flexibility in the use of the fund, and by allowing GEPA to create a reserve fund for the purpose of emergency responses to environmental threats.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postguam.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/f3/7f34c83a-70f5-4416-bd01-94f5ef516a40/686b2e83a02af.image.jpg?crop=1500%2C788%2C0%2C106&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-07-07 06:07:18.817856

The bill quickly phases out tax incentives and investments for wind and solar power passed under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

Jim DesJardins, executive director of the Renewable Energy Industries Association of New Mexico, said both consumers and businesses in the solar industry have made huge investments due to the incentives.

""There's people who've got loans on their homes, and overnight this bill is going to pull the rug out from underneath them,"" DesJardins asserted. ""This will destroy thousands of businesses, will put tens of thousands of people out of work, for what? Why are we doing this?""

Since passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, a boom in renewable energy has led to more than $300 billion in spending. Another $500 billion dollars was allocated for clean energy projects but those could now be abandoned.

New Mexico is the second-largest crude oil producer in the U.S. and with more than 300 days of sunshine, it is considered among the top 10 states for potential solar development. Most experts are not predicting a collapse in the renewable energy industry but without federal subsidies and tax credits, solar and wind farms could become more expensive.

After signing a contract, DesJardins pointed out it can take years to get a solar project off the ground and Trump's new bill would let incentives expire before the end of 2027.

""There's just so much uncertainty for a large solar project you can't say, 'Oh, we're going to put it into operation on this day.' It just doesn't work like that,"" DesJardins stressed. ""We need to stop this herky-jerky way of doing policy whether it's for farmers, whether it's for renewable energy, it's just very counterproductive.""

Despite the setback to wind and solar, DesJardins believes renewable industries will persevere, one way or another.

After being debated for days, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, are among those who voted to advance the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" to push President Donald Trump's agenda forward.

Curtis was one of a handful of Republicans who wanted to preserve clean energy tax credits but the Senate made major cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar projects. Now, the bill does not allow for a project to get the tax credit if it does not begin producing electricity by 2028.

Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the change could reverse years of progress and innovation.

""It has really devastating impacts,"" Gallagher emphasized. ""Not just to the solar industry, but to American energy security and national security. Solar energy is putting more new power on the grid than every other fuel source combined in the last several years.""

Curtis was able to remove a provision that would've enacted a new tax on solar and wind projects and ended a ban on solar leasing. While Curtis expressed gratitude to Senate leaders for including his changes, Gallagher hopes the concessions do not hinder the industry's ability to meet demand. The budget bill now goes back to the U.S. House for what could be the final vote.

Projects started before the bill is enacted would be protected from penalties and setbacks. Current projects would also retain all of their tax-credit value through December 2027. Gallagher argued the tax credits, passed under the Inflation Reduction Act, are working.

""Every dollar spent on clean energy tax credits has a $2.67 return in the form of lower energy costs for consumers, and taxes paid by clean energy infrastructure projects, mostly property taxes,"" Gallagher pointed out.

The Trump administration has called for energy dominance and so far has focused on supporting more development of fossil fuels over renewable energy. And while wind and solar energy are still popular across the board, recent polling indicates some people, especially Republicans, are less supportive of renewable energy than in Trump's first term.

Groups representing workers in the renewable power sector are slamming the possible repeal of clean-energy tax credits in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" currently before the U.S. Senate.

The bill would repeal tax credits for solar and electric cars, part of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a national organization of business leaders who advocate for smart clean-energy policies, said the bill could crush the clean-energy economy and not just in blue states such as California.

""If we ever wanted a policy in this country that would kill jobs, reduce business investments and make us less competitive, while also reducing our electricity supplies in this country, we've got it,"" Keefe contended.

In the past three years, companies have announced more than $130 billion in clean energy projects. Trump campaigned against the tax credits and wants to put the savings toward an extension of his 2017 tax cuts. A new report from E2 showed since Trump took office in January, companies have canceled more than $15 billion worth of projects.

Keefe pointed out California has the most clean energy jobs in the country, so it has the most to lose.

""There are more than a half a million Californians who work in clean energy, solar, wind, energy efficiency, electric vehicles,"" Keefe reported. ""When you take away a 30% tax credit for building solar projects, sales are naturally going to decrease, projects are going to get canceled and jobs are going to be impacted.""

Data show more than 75,000 Californians work in the electric vehicle industry. The bill eliminates the $7,500 EV tax credit which makes EVs more affordable. If the bill passes it would have to be reconciled with the House version and reapproved before it reaches the President.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicles are helping drive clean transportation in the Lehigh Valley, but advocates warn they're at risk of being cut by the budget reconciliation bill being heard in Congress.

Supporters say the credits lower emissions, grow the economy, and save Pennsylvanians money.

Sarah DeGrendel, sustainability manager with the City of Bethlehem, urged Pennsylvania lawmakers to oppose any efforts to eliminate the EV and charging tax credits and vital EV manufacturing investments.

""Bethlehem has committed to reducing our overall transportation emissions by 30% by 2030, with an overall goal reduction of emissions by 33% by 2025 and 60% by 2030,"" said DeGrendel. ""This is a journey to route zero, and it is one we are pursuing with a purpose.""

The federal EV tax credit is worth up to $7,500 and is currently available through 2033. In Congress, senators are divided over whether to keep the Biden-era tax credits.

The budget bill passed in the House and is currently under consideration in the Senate.

Tony Bandiero, executive director of the Eastern Pennsylvania Alliance for Clean Transportation, said Pennsylvania has over 139,000 electric vehicles on the road.

He said he believes federal EV tax credits are helping to boost the economy.

""We have seen double digit growth of EV sales year over year in the US,"" said Bandiero, ""which is being driven by federal EV tax credits bolstering manufacturing sectors, and ensuring growing long term job stability for clean energy workers and suppliers.""

Andrea Wittchen, president of the Lehigh Valley Sustainability Network, stressed the importance of federal investments in electric vehicles for public health.

She noted that the transportation sector is the largest source of carbon pollution nationally, and the second largest in Pennsylvania.

""In 2024 for the second year in a row,"" said Wittchen, ""the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America identified Allentown as the number one worst place to live in the United States for people who suffer from asthma and allergies.""

Wittchen also pointed out that electric vehicles have zero tailpipe emissions, and they drastically reduce air pollution caused by tailpipe emissions from fossil fuel cars and trucks.

She noted that cleaner air and healthier communities result from zero tailpipe pollution.

,American Energy,2025-07-07 08:08:07+00:00,Canary Media,Is wind power finally coming to Maine's remote north? | Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/wind/maine-aroostook-clean-power-transmission,"For wind power advocates, these moves have sparked hope that a new source of renewable energy may finally be developed in the region.
However, as the Trump administration throws up roadblocks to offshore wind development, it becomes even more important to tap into land-based wind to keep progressing toward a cleaner energy future, supporters said.
John Baldacci (D) signed a law setting a goal of bringing 2,000 MW of wind power online by 2015 and 3,000 MW, including some offshore wind, by 2020.
Still, Pullaro said, history suggests that onshore wind development could survive the blow of losing federal support.
A wind development stands a much better chance of succeeding, he said, if another state commits to buying power from it, giving it a revenue stream it can count on.","Two years after the last attempt to build out wind farms in Maine’s northern reaches fizzled, the state is again gearing up to seek developers to build at least 1,200 megawatts of land-based wind capacity and a transmission line to carry the electricity produced to the central part of the state. At the same time, grid operator ISO New England is accepting proposals for new transmission infrastructure that will allow that power to flow to the rest of the region.

For wind power advocates, these moves have sparked hope that a new source of renewable energy may finally be developed in the region.

“After talking about this for the last 15 years, I feel like there’s a light at the end of the tunnel,” said Francis Pullaro, president of clean-energy industry association RENEW Northeast. ​“It’s definitely complicated and a big undertaking, but I think the state has realized what a great opportunity northern Maine wind provides.”

Maine and most of its neighboring states have ambitious emissions-reduction targets: Maine just adopted legislation calling for 100% clean energy by 2040, for example, and Massachusetts and Rhode Island both aim to be carbon-neutral by 2050. Offshore wind has been a major part of the states’ strategies for transitioning away from a system that now leans heavily on natural gas for electricity generation. However, as the Trump administration throws up roadblocks to offshore wind development, it becomes even more important to tap into land-based wind to keep progressing toward a cleaner energy future, supporters said.

“It’s a really important medium-term piece of the puzzle in how we reduce our dependence on gas as a region and for our state,” said Jack Shapiro, climate and clean energy director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, an environmental advocacy group. ​“It’s a pretty big deal.”

Plans to build onshore wind in northern Maine’s remote Aroostook County have come and gone several times over the past two decades. In 2008, then-Gov. John Baldacci (D) signed a law setting a goal of bringing 2,000 MW of wind power online by 2015 and 3,000 MW, including some offshore wind, by 2020. As of this year, the state has 1,139 MW of onshore wind operational and no offshore turbines.

Aroostook County — with its strong winds and low population density — has long been considered a prime area for building turbines, but its promise has not been realized. One of the major obstacles has been the lack of transmission lines to carry power from the forests of northern Maine to the lightbulbs and dishwashers of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Most of Aroostook County is served by an electrical system connected only to Canada, with no direct links to any U.S. power grid. Building the needed lines is a complex, costly undertaking that has repeatedly stymied efforts to get wind generation up and spinning.

“For the southern New England states where all the load is, [northern Maine] always was a fairly distant resource,” Pullaro said. ​“The lack of transmission has always been the barrier.”

In 2013, Connecticut selected a planned wind development in Aroostook County — EDP Renewables’ Number Nine Wind Farm — to provide 250 MW of power to the state. By the end of 2016, the project had been cancelled, with EDP citing the lack of transmission capacity to get the electricity to customers farther south.

In the final days of 2022, Massachusetts agreed to buy 40% of the power generated by the proposed King Pine wind farm in Aroostook County, a deal that seemed to give the 1,000-MW project the financial security it needed to proceed. By the end of 2023, however, a separate agreement with LS Power to build a transmission line connecting the development to the rest of New England fell through over pricing disagreements, undermining the prospect of wind development.

“The contract negotiations were not successful, and the project stalled,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Maine Governor’s Energy Office.

Now the state has gone back to the drawing board. This time around, however, the plans are getting an unprecedented boost from ISO New England. The regional grid operator in late March issued a request for proposals for the development of a transmission project connecting the Maine town of Pittsfield to points farther south in New England, shortening the distance the power lines from future Aroostook County wind farms will have to travel. A plan could be chosen as soon as September 2026.

Meanwhile Maine utilities regulators released a request for information to collect feedback from developers, industry members, and other stakeholders to help plan and schedule its next procurement. There has been a robust response to the request, though most comments were filed confidentially, said Susan Faloon, spokesperson for the Maine Public Utilities Commission. The tentative plan is to open up for proposals by the end of the year, she said.

Whether the next attempt will be successful hinges on a few factors, starting with its ability to financially weather Republicans’ scaleback of federal clean-energy tax credits and the administration’s continued, evolving hostility to renewable energy projects. Trump halted federal permitting and leasing for wind projects on his first day in office, and although 99% of onshore wind farms are built on private property, they still could need environmental permits from the administration.

“The economics of any specific project is really uncertain right now because we don’t know what will happen,” Shapiro said.

Still, Pullaro said, history suggests that onshore wind development could survive the blow of losing federal support. The grid needs more energy, and land-based wind is one of the least expensive power sources to build, even without incentives, while the cost of new natural gas generation is going up, according to a recent report from investment bank Lazard.

“From the industry point of view and for consumers, wind is still a good deal no matter where the tax situation is,” Pullaro said.

Tweaks to the state’s timeline for issuing a request for proposals and choosing a project could also increase the likelihood of success, Pullaro said. A wind development stands a much better chance of succeeding, he said, if another state commits to buying power from it, giving it a revenue stream it can count on. Getting Massachusetts on board could be even more crucial than federal support, he said.

Massachusetts is still authorized to enter into another such agreement until the end of the year, and Gov. Maura Healey (D) included in a supplemental budget bill a provision that would extend this authorization to 2027, but the legislation is still pending. In the meantime, if Maine waits until the end of 2025 or into 2026 to launch a new solicitation, the eventual development could lose its chance to secure a deal with Massachusetts. Pullaro, therefore, would like to see Maine issue a request for proposals by September.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Maine-wind-turbines.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=cdaa20c2bb84626bde6eacfc1146186f,N,,2025-07-07 07:09:03.559769

Solon has decided to compete in these dire circumstances by essentially building the entire menu of items needed for a modern solar, battery, or microgrid project, and designing all the pieces to fit together seamlessly. His new firm, Create Energy, will sell developers solar modules, trackers, batteries, inverters, power stations, and other auxiliary equipment. The goal is to save customers time and effort compared to buying separately from a tracker vendor, a module vendor, an inverter vendor, and so on, and then assembling all those components with separate crews.

It’s an ominous time to start a new solar manufacturing business in America, to say the least. After a booming few years following the implementation of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and its various, generous clean-energy manufacturing incentives, firms now find themselves squeezed between fluctuating tariffs and the detonation of those same incentives, following President Donald Trump’s signing of the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act last week.

What better moment to check in with one of the most singular voices in the solar industry, who has survived and thrived through the solarcoaster of the last two decades without wavering in his commitment to American manufacturing?

U.S. factories can work, but tariffs are complicating the buildout

Solon’s previous company Shoals originally made automotive parts for Bosch back in the ​‘90s. But after the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect, lifting most tariffs between Canada, the U.S., and Mexico, Bosch wanted to relocate its suppliers to the latter nation, and Solon refused to move his operation out of Tennessee, he recalled.

Around that same time, he got an inbound request from a budding solar enterprise that needed some manufactured junction boxes and cable assemblies; that upstart turned out to be First Solar, pretty much the only U.S. panel manufacturer that has excelled over the last few decades (and whose stock has been on a tear as Congress prepared to revoke tax credits for solar projects that use Chinese-made materials).

Once he made the jump into solar equipment in the early 2000s, Solon kept manufacturing in America, even as installers and developers embraced cheaper Chinese products and U.S. cell and module manufacturing collapsed.

“Solar makes sense, with or without incentives; Buying American-made products, even better,” Solon said. ​“Listen, I fly the American flag like crazy. I grew up in the ​‘70s working on American cars. I’m a gearhead my whole life. I love American-made products, and I’m gonna push it.”

That ethos continues in the new venture. The strategy is to build high-quality equipment and find customers who understand its value, because they’re investing with a longer-term mindset.

“We’re not looking for every Tom, Dick, and Harry that’s trying to flip a project to build it as cheap as possible with garbage,” he said. ​“I’m looking for the [independent power producers], the big power companies, who want to buy systems that are going to last for decades.”

In theory, a company with this attitude would welcome tariffs, which raise the cost of cheaply produced competition from Chinese factories. The last few months have seen new tariffs aplenty, though Trump has waived some within days or weeks of announcing them. But while tariffs are often billed as helpful to domestic manufacturers, President Trump’s tariffs are also causing complications for the American factory buildout.

For starters, Trump’s blanket tariffs on all Chinese goods impact manufacturing equipment produced in that country. Not only does China make most of the world’s solar panels — it also makes many of the machines required to manufacture solar.

“To be clear on this point, there’s no better-built machines for solar than Chinese equipment, end of story,” Solon said. ​“That’s how good it is. It’s heads and tails better than anywhere else you could get machinery.”

“It was easy to order machinery, but then once the tariffs hit, there’s a lot of machinery just sitting in ports in China that hasn’t left,” he added.

Even if Solon could get his hands on that equipment without exorbitant price hikes, the U.S. lacks enough production of solar cells — the component that actually converts sunlight into electricity — to meet the demand for domestic module assembly. Factories that can’t obtain the limited domestic cells need to import them, but the so-called reciprocal tariffs Trump has announced on much of the world, and then delayed, have scrambled the economics for cells from outside the U.S.

Create is making other products at its Portland, Tennessee, factory, but the timeline for making solar modules in-house has been pushed back due to the macroeconomic headwinds.

To enter the solar market today, deliver big savings

A decade ago, solar module costs started to plunge, and the price of solar-generated power fell along with it. That has propelled solar to the front of the pack for new power plant construction. But lately the slope of cost declines has leveled off, and incremental module improvements do less and less to push the cost of solar power lower.

Solon is stepping into that mature marketplace, so he has to bring something new to the table to stand out. After years of making the electrical connectors needed to hook up solar panels into a functioning power plant, he realized he could eliminate several steps for installers with clever design hacks.

Today’s standard solar-plant construction process creates inefficiencies. ​“Everyone is this separate crew working on the same rows over and over and over ​‘til they do it in the next location,” Solon said.

A singular project might have different crews clear the earth, pound the posts, add torque tubes, bolt the modules in place, check the torque on the bolts, handle the electrical work, and then clean up the site, he said.

The new products from Create come with electrical connections pre-wired into the modules and the torque tubes of the trackers. Installers can easily snap everything together, at which point, Solon insists, the systems won’t need any more maintenance.

Solon’s goal was to make installation so easy that it would be doable for an avatar of the modern man that he refers to as ​“Mr. Hot-Pocket Muncher,” who is ​“happy living in mommy’s basement eating Hot Pockets and playing 12 hours of Xbox.”

“Take my module, and grab Mr. Hot-Pocket Muncher,” Solon envisioned, after showing me an AI rendering of the character, which his colleague on hand advised him against making available for publication. ​“He picks it up. He clicks it on the torque tube. Did I hear it click? Yes, I’m done. Grab the next one. Click, yes. All the wiring is done. All the mechanical connections are done, and they’re non-serviceable. There’s nothing for an [operations and maintenance] crew to ever do again.”

That vision would threaten a number of specialized jobs in the solar installation and maintenance business. But it would also deliver more efficient construction, so the same workforce could theoretically deliver more clean power in the same amount of time. If Solon can pull it off, that kind of benefit could be valuable as the industry stares down the loss of its decades-long tax-credit regime.

The solar industry is in for a period of pain, so stability matters

Solon doesn’t deny that the solar industry writ large is heading for a contraction, but he rejects the more apocalyptic outlooks some fear for the sector. Instead, he thinks it’ll be a reset for the industry after the bounty of Biden-era policy supercharged the pace of activity.

“Right now, the solar business is a drunk pirate that partied like a rock star all last night,” Solon mused. ​“We woke up, we’re hung over as hell, and we’re reaching for our wallet and our keys, and we can’t find either one of them. And we wonder what the hell happened? I think we’re gonna be hung over for about six months to a year.”

“If you’re in a consolidated market [and] people are going out of business, who are you going to run to to get your products and services?” chimed in Create’s chief of staff, Joe Fahrney, who was sitting next to Solon at the Midwest Solar Expo. ​“So people are lining up to buy from Dean Solon, because they know Dean and Create will be in business over the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Solar-Farm-dean-solon.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=b8d34bf2a734db69b96d3bebef215cdd,N,,2025-07-07 05:02:57.949504

The FUSE Executive Fellow will contribute to the development of these resources and advance implementation by facilitating stakeholder engagement, closing skills gaps, and sharing best practices so a broad range of communities in the Southwest can participate in this transformation, laying the groundwork for enhancing solar capacity and other renewable energy sources. As a result of this work, Southwestern communities will have safe, resilient homes and workplaces that are both climate-adapted and renewable energy-ready, even as the climate changes.

Fellowship Dates: October 27, 2025 – October 23, 2026

Salary: Executive Fellows are FUSE employees and receive an annual base salary of $80,000. Fellows can also access various health, dental, and vision insurance benefits. Compensation for this year of public service is not intended to represent market-rate compensation for the experienced professionals in our program.

ABOUT THE FUSE EXECUTIVE FELLOWSHIP

FUSE is a national nonprofit dedicated to increasing the capacity of local governments to work more effectively for communities. We embed private sector executives in city and county agencies to lead projects that improve public services and accelerate systems change. Since 2012, FUSE has led over 400 projects in 58 governments across 26 states, impacting a total population equivalent to 1 in 10 Americans.

When designing each fellowship project, FUSE works closely with government partners and community stakeholders to define a scope of work that will achieve substantive progress toward high-priority local needs. Projects address today’s most pressing challenges and opportunities, including affordable housing, economic mobility, climate resilience, public safety, infrastructure, technology, and more.

FUSE conducts a full executive search for each individual project to ensure that the selected candidate has at least 15 years of professional experience, the required competencies for the role, and deep connections to the community being served.

Executive Fellows are embedded in government agencies working with senior leaders for at least one year of full-time work. Prospective responsibilities may include thorough data analytics and research, developing enhanced operations and financial models, building change management and strategic planning processes, and/or building broad coalitions to support project implementation efforts. Executive Fellows are data-driven and results-oriented and able to effectively manage complex projects. They build strong relationships with a broad array of stakeholders, foster alignment within and across various layers of government, and build partnerships between governments and communities.

Throughout the fellowships, Executive Fellows receive training, coaching, and professional support to help achieve their project goals.

PROJECT CONTEXT

Arizona is one of the fastest growing states in the country. Between 2000 and 2023, the state’s population grew by 44%. New Mexico is not far behind, with 16.1% growth. This has increased demand on the housing market and caused a residential and commercial construction boom. As Southwestern communities continue to expand, builders must account for climate change. Pima County, for example, has a high climate change risk, especially for drought, wildfires, and heat. Updating building codes to promote climate adaptation and resilience would save Arizona residents $23 billion in energy costs and reduce emissions by 253 million metric tons over the next 30 years. In addition, more climate-resilient buildings could save lives, as the number of indoor heat deaths doubled between 2022 and 2023.

New building codes would be especially transformative for BIPOC residents. Black and Indigenous residents in Maricopa County, for example, were disproportionately represented in 2023 heat-related deaths. This disparity is due to a number of factors, but more climate-resilient, energy-efficient housing and commercial buildings would make it safer and more comfortable for all Arizonans and New Mexicans to live and work inside as temperatures rise. This initiative not only aims to create resilient structures but also fosters a regulatory environment that supports sustainable energy practices, ultimately making Tucson more sustainable through the method of building.

As a home rule state, every Arizona municipality is responsible for setting its own building code. Facilitating the adoption of this code will require extensive local engagement, education, and workforce development. To achieve this, the City of Tucson joined a coalition of Arizona and New Mexico communities working to develop and implement a climate-resilient set of building codes that are tailored to the southwestern United States. The Resilient Southwest Building Code Collaborative is a multi-sectoral, interstate partnership that will facilitate code development, conduct public engagement to encourage understanding and uptake of the code, and grow the workforce skills to help municipalities and companies implement the code. This collaborative is funded by two federal grants that aim to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy efficiency while promoting equity and inclusion of marginalized communities.

The City of Tucson will partner with FUSE Corps to promote and facilitate adoption of the new Southwest-specific building code by assessing existing code adoption resources and barriers, developing supporting materials to build community awareness of building code impacts on resilience, and improving workforce development messaging, particularly among underserved and marginalized communities. The Executive Fellow will research training and skill-building resources that meet communities’ and industry’s needs; craft community outreach materials that maintain technical integrity while engaging historically marginalized communities; and facilitate knowledge sharing between local governments, the building industry, and education partners to improve implementation of resilience and energy codes. As a result, Southwest residents will have safe shelter and workplaces, even in the face of climate change.

PROJECT SUMMARY

Starting in November 2025, the FUSE Executive Fellow will develop deep relationships with a broad range of stakeholders, including Collaborative City partners (e.g., participating municipalities in Arizona and New Mexico, with an emphasis on building departments), policy and research partners (e.g., University of Arizona), technical partners (e.g., New Buildings Institute, International Code Council, Southwest Energy Efficiency Project), training partners (e.g., community college network) and industry stakeholders. The Executive Fellow will seek to understand the challenges, opportunities, and aspirations these partners have for adopting a climate-resilient building code. In addition, the Executive Fellow will identify supporting resources that could facilitate adoption of resilience and energy codes and messaging strategies to increase participation in building construction careers. The Fellow will use these conversations and inventory of supporting resources to assist in drafting a visionary Net Zero Roadmap for the Collaborative. Finally, the Executive Fellow will work with their Executive Sponsor and Project Supervisor to develop a project management plan and approve specific project goals and deliverables. While these goals and deliverables will likely include the ones listed below, they may differ based on situational changes.

Next, the Executive Fellow will work extensively with education partners to analyze the needs and skills gaps identified by municipal building departments and the building industry. Armed with this analysis, they will assist local community colleges in developing implementation plans to fill those gaps. These implementation plans will focus on how the colleges enhance or create technical programs that would train students to become energy specialists and place graduates in municipal governments and private sector firms. The analysis and findings will feed into several deliverables to the United States Department of Energy in support of fulfilling the Collaborative’s grant commitments.

At the same time, the Executive Fellow will utilize the Collaborative’s robust community engagement process to develop resources that ensure that historically marginalized communities understand the importance of the new code and benefit from its rollout. These materials will be part of a project website, which will encourage the uptake of the new code by municipalities and builders across the region and build community support for resilience and energy code adoption. Developing these resources will require intensive engagement with both technical and equity partners to ensure that materials are accurate and accessible to a wide audience. These resources should also help people from historically marginalized communities learn about the new training programs so that they can gain certification and both benefit from and contribute to this transition. As workers are empowered with the skills to build according to updated codes, the City will simultaneously create opportunities for increased adoption of solar energy and other renewables, positioning Tucson as a leader in sustainable development.

By the end of the year, the Executive Fellow should equip the Resilient Southwest Building Code Collaborative with resources to promote uptake of the new code. For example, by September 2026, the Collaborative should have a draft plan to train and certify 200 energy specialists in the State of Arizona by the end of the grant. In addition, the municipalities should have tangible resources to facilitate adoption of resilience and energy codes. To ensure the sustainability of this work, the Executive Fellow should facilitate handover of any information and ongoing responsibilities to the appropriate stakeholders prior to the end of the Fellowship.

BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- In a waste incineration plant in Xinxiang, central China's Henan Province, towering steel claws move gracefully, transferring mountains of municipal waste into the fermentation chamber.

Once sufficiently broken down, the waste is fed into the incinerator, where the intense heat transforms water into steam to power turbines to generate electricity.

""The facility converts 1,800 tonnes of waste daily into electricity and serves as an energy hub for the city,"" said Wang Limin, in charge of the facility.

This waste-to-energy facility stands among many advanced waste-to-energy plants across China that convert garbage into energy through advanced technology, providing clean electricity to households and reducing carbon emissions.

In the past, China used landfills as a primary method for garbage disposal, which posed risks to land, groundwater and air quality. Fueled by an intensifying environmental consciousness, China has transformed its waste management paradigm over the past two decades by promoting cleaner and more efficient waste incineration technology.

Today, over 1,000 large-scale incineration plants operate across China, processing more than 1.1 million tonnes of waste daily -- equivalent to filling 440 standard Olympic-sized swimming pools (each holding 2,500 tonnes of water).

Technological maturation has been equally striking. Breakthroughs in combustion control systems, flue gas treatment solutions, and real-time emissions monitoring have propelled China to a global leadership position.

China's national emission standards for waste-to-energy plants align with the latest EU benchmarks, positioning them among the world's most stringent. Some regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, have implemented even stricter local regulations that surpass EU thresholds.

""By adopting domestically engineered grate-furnace technology with proprietary intellectual rights, we've achieved 40 percent greater thermal efficiency than a decade ago,"" said Ma Kejun, deputy general manager of a waste-to-energy plant in the Xixian New Area of Shaanxi Province.

""At nearly 1,000 degrees Celsius, the waste is fully combusted, and our monitoring reports show dioxin emissions are only one-tenth of the EU limit,"" he added.

This technical prowess now fuels international expansion. By May 2025, Chinese companies had participated in or secured contracts for 79 overseas waste incineration projects spanning Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America and North America.

""China's waste-incineration industry has evolved from 'harmless disposal' to 'high-efficiency resource utilization',"" said Xie Yuhong, vice chairman and secretary-general of the All-China Environment Federation, urging international collaboration to tackle global waste crises.

The increasing sophistication of incineration technology doesn't mean free rein to create waste.

""Incineration is an end-of-pipe fix -- its financial and ecological costs dwarfing source reduction,"" said environmental advocate Zhang Jingning.

Ma Wenchao, a professor from Tianjin University's School of Environmental Science and Engineering, notes that the rapid growth of e-commerce, food delivery, and courier services has led to a surge in single-use plastic packaging waste.

Since plastic production relies on fossil fuels, its entire lifecycle -- from manufacturing to incineration -- generates massive carbon emissions that accelerate climate change. ""In the end, this harms not only ourselves but also future generations,"" Ma said, urging stronger efforts to cut waste at the source and improve waste sorting.

Globally, the 3R's approach -- Reduce (using fewer products), Reuse (extending product life), and Recycle (recovering materials for new production) -- guides sustainable waste management. China enshrined this same principle in the Circular Economy Promotion Law in 2008, becoming the world's third nation to enact dedicated circular economy legislation.

By doubling down on the 3Rs, China can reduce waste at its source and enhance waste-sorting systems to accelerate its progress toward a circular economy, according to experts. ■",,N,,2025-07-07 07:09:31.755370

Wolfspeed, and in its former guise Cree, has been at the very forefront of our industry for decades. Building on its initial expertise in SiC, this spin-out of North Carolina State University that founded in the late 1980s has been a trailblazer of SiC substrates, along with high-brightness LEDs and power and RF electronics.

In recent times, driven by the vision of Wolfspeed’s former CEO, Gregg Lowe, the company has streamlined its business, first carving out its LED division and then selling its RF business to Macom in December 2023.

While these moves that have shifted the focus to SiC substrates, epiwafers and power devices make much sense, given that the current portfolio is aligned with an electric vehicle market that is sure to climb over the coming years, it’s not prevented Wolfspeed from finding itself trapped in a particularly ferocious perfect storm. Peril has resulted from borrowing big to try and fully exploit growth in softening SiC markets, while facing increasingly stiff competition from Chinese makers of SiC substrates that are slashing prices to win sales in a sector suffering from overcapacity.

Now Wolfspeed is trying to extricate itself from this precarious position by starting to convert billion-dollar cash injections from BorgWarner, ZF and Renesas into shares, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late June, and trimming its wage bill by laying of a 20 percent of its workforce.

The total cost of ownership of a heavy-duty electric truck used in long-haul transport, in the estimation of the IEA, has already reached parity with diesel trucks in China, with savings on fuel offsetting shigher price for electric trucks.
The operating cost of electric trucks can be lowered by charging batteries during the rest periods required for commercial drivers.
In the US, on the other hand, the Trump administration is tearing down the regulatory supports for zero-emission vehicles, including electric trucks.
Finally, the statement noted, eliminating California’s emission control and electric vehicle promotion policies would amount to “Giving the keys to China” – the keys to the global market for electric vehicles outside the US.","China is extending its dominance of electric vehicles from passenger cars to heavy trucks as President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill eliminates federal subsidies at a time when European support for the industry remains weaker than it once was.

Production and consumption of gasoline and diesel are declining in China, reducing demand for imported oil and resulting in less road noise, cleaner air and better health for urban residents.

In addition to the environmental benefits, the US and Europe are missing out on another clean-energy market opportunity. Economic research organization Mordor Intelligence expects the global electric truck market to more than double in size to $89 billion in 2025 and grow at a CAGR of 26% to $227 billion by 2029.

The medium-duty commercial truck segment is projected to grow most rapidly (39% CAGR over the same period), but the heavy-duty segment is the largest, having accounted for 87% of the market in 2024.

Zero-emission targets are the main demand driver, but a well-developed charging infrastructure is essential. Improvements in battery performance (longer range), the expansion of battery manufacturing capacity and the development of new and more efficient vehicles equipped with driver assistance systems facilitate and enhance the growth. China has it all.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global sales of bettery-powered electric trucks increased by nearly 80% in 2024, led by a 2X increase in China, which accounted for more than 80% of the total.

Starting from a very low base and propelled by government incentives, the number of electric trucks sold in China rose to about 75,000 vehicles. Sales in Europe and the US, the second and third largest markets, were roughly flat.

The total cost of ownership of a heavy-duty electric truck used in long-haul transport, in the estimation of the IEA, has already reached parity with diesel trucks in China, with savings on fuel offsetting shigher price for electric trucks. In Europe and the US, the IEA expects parity to be reached by 2030. The operating cost of electric trucks can be lowered by charging batteries during the rest periods required for commercial drivers.

Chinese Truck Review reports that sales in China of new energy vehicle (NEV) heavy-duty trucks, including hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell-powered vehicles, amounted to 82,773 vehicles last year. That works out to a market penetration rate of 13%, compared with about 2% in Europe and 1% in the US.

The world’s top makers of electric trucks include

BYD, Dongfeng Motor, SANY Heavy Industry XCMG and Sinotruk in China;

AB Volvo (Volvo Trucks) and Daimler Truck in Europe; and

Paccar and Tesla in the US.

AB Volvo is separate from Volvo Cars, which is 78.6%-owned by Chinese automaker Geely. Geely is AB Volvo’s largest shareholder, but has only 15.7% of the voting rights.

Europe and the US, therefore, have the ability to build up their electric truck industries over time.

Like China, the EU is promoting their introduction with zero emission targets, market incentives and the build-out of battery charging infrastructure. But its electricity grid is not yet ready to handle the power requirements.

According to Chief Commercial Vehicles Officer Thomas Fabian of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA): “A fit-for-purpose charging network for heavy-duty vehicles is essential to decarbonize road transport. But without a future-ready grid, this transition simply will not happen.”

As an ACEA position paper on the matter explains that, by 2030, “for operators of charging infrastructure, there is a need for further political measures.” It lists these:

reduced bureaucracy,

acceleration, standardization, digitalization of grid connections and building permits,

transparent and non-discriminatory access to public sites, and

support for a strong ramp-up of zero-emission vehicles.

In the US, on the other hand, the Trump administration is tearing down the regulatory supports for zero-emission vehicles, including electric trucks. On June 12, the president signed Congressional Review Act resolutions revoking California’s Clean Air Act waivers, which allow the state to set its own strict vehicle emission standards, including those for heavy trucks, and would have phased out sales of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035.

The statement from the White House reads: “These bipartisan measures prevent California’s attempt to impose a nationwide electric vehicle mandate and to regulate national fuel economy by regulating carbon emissions.”

That comment reflects the size of California’s economy, which gives it great influence over the decisions of automakers. It also influences the policies of other states, more than a dozen of which follow California’s emissions standards.

Trump himself stated that “We officially rescue the US auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all.”

But California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta immediately filed a lawsuit challenging the resolutions signed by Trump with a statement reading:

Last month, the Republican-controlled House and Senate illegally used the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to attempt to revoke California’s Clean Air Act waivers, which authorize California’s clean cars and trucks program. This defies decades of precedent of these waivers not being subject to the CRA, and contradicts the non-partisan Government Accountability Office and Senate parliamentarian, who both ruled that the CRA’s short-circuited process does not apply to the waivers.

Governor Newsom was quoted as saying, “Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process. We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

The statement then pointed out that “The state’s efforts to clean its air ramped up under then-Governor Ronald Reagan when he established the California Air Resources Board. California’s Clean Air Act waivers date back to the Nixon Administration – allowing the state to set standards necessary for cleaning up some of the worst air pollution in the country.”

Those standards were approved by conservative politicians and they are meant to be business friendly. The statement continuesd:

Since the Clean Air Act was adopted in 1970, the U.S. EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] has granted California more than 100 waivers for its clean air and climate efforts. California has consistently demonstrated that its standards are feasible, and that manufacturers have enough lead time to develop the technology to meet them. It has done so for every waiver it has submitted.

Waivers do not expire, and there is no process for revoking a waiver. This is important because governments and industry rely on market certainty that waivers provide for years after they are granted to deliver clean vehicles and develop clean air plans.

California’s clean air regulations are also intended to protect and improve public health, something the White House did not mention but the California statement did:

Air pollution is a silent killer that causes heart and lung diseases, and cancer. Over the last 50 years, the state’s clean air efforts have saved $250 billion in health costs through reduced illness including reducing diesel-related cancer risk nearly 80%.

If upheld, President Trump’s illegal rollback of these regulations would cost Californian taxpayers an estimated $45 billion in health care costs.

Finally, the statement noted, eliminating California’s emission control and electric vehicle promotion policies would amount to “Giving the keys to China” – the keys to the global market for electric vehicles outside the US.

Johnson, who ceremoniously handed Trump the gavel after the president signed his signature tax cuts and spending package into law Friday, teased two future bills to be passed within the next year.
Johnson expects a second reconciliation bill by fall and a third by spring before the end of the current Congress.
Johnson stressed that the bill permanently extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which the speaker claims targeted lower- and middle-income Americans.
“And that’s going to help the economy, it’s going be jet fuel.","House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s megabill will be “jet fuel” for the economy despite Democrats’ criticisms.

Johnson, who ceremoniously handed Trump the gavel after the president signed his signature tax cuts and spending package into law Friday, teased two future bills to be passed within the next year. In an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” he said the “big, beautiful bill,” which is “a huge leap forward for our priorities,” is the first step in a three-tier strategy. Johnson expects a second reconciliation bill by fall and a third by spring before the end of the current Congress.

“I think we can do that, and so you’ll see more of us advancing these common-sense principles to deliver that American First agenda for the people,” Johnson said. “That’s what they elected us to do, and this was hugely forward.”

Johnson pushed back on a reported Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) memo claiming Republicans will lose the majority in 2026 as a result of the “big, beautiful bill.”

TRUMP SIGNS ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL’ BILL IN SWEEPING VICTORY FOR SECOND TERM AGENDA, OVERCOMING DEMS AND GOP REBELS

“Our Republicans are going to be out across the country telling the simple truth, and guess what? It will be demonstrated,” Johnson said. “Everyone will have more take-home pay, they’ll have more jobs and opportunity. The economy will be doing better, and we’ll be able to point to that as the obvious result of what we did. So don’t buy into those false talking points.”

The speaker dismissed criticisms from Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and DNC Chair Ken Martin in particular as “old, tired talking points” that are typically used against any Republican tax legislation.

Johnson stressed that the bill permanently extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which the speaker claims targeted lower- and middle-income Americans. He said the bottom 20% of earners witnessed their lowest federal tax rates in 40 years because of those original cuts and said that the new megabill expands on that by cutting taxes on tips, overtime pay, and seniors – benefits that he says will help Republicans during the 2026 midterm elections.

“We’re giving everybody a tax cut,” Johnson told “Fox News Sunday” host Shannon Bream. “And that’s going to help the economy, it’s going be jet fuel. Small business owners, entrepreneurs, risk-takers, the people that provide the jobs, manufacturers, farmers get assistance here, and that will lift the economy.”

Citing the Council of Joint Economic Advisers, Johnson said the megabill will spur 3% economic growth, create 4 million jobs and increase the average household’s take-home pay by $13,000.

“This is a great thing for people who go to work every day,” Johnson said. “They’re going to feel that. And we’re excited about the upcoming election cycle in ’26. Because people will be riding an economic high, just as we did after the first two years of the first Trump administration. This time it’s on steroids.”

ZELENSKYY TOUTS ‘FRUITFUL’ TRUMP CALL AFTER US PRESIDENT WAS ‘DISAPPOINTED’ BY PUTIN TALK

Johnson also responded to criticism from Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., who argued that the megabill makes tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans permanent, while those for the working class “are time sensitive” and “expire in a couple of years.”

“Now, I don’t think he read the bill, it’s 940 pages, so I would give some grace on that,” Johnson said in response to Ivey’s claims.

Bream noted that Ivey was listening while the bill text was read on the Senate floor last Sunday.

“Yeah, you’re right, for 19 hours or whatever it took,” Johnson said. “If you make between $30,000 and $80,000 a year, you can have a 15% less federal tax rate. You’re going to save more money, you’re going to keep more of your hard-earned money, and that’s not going away. So by making all these tax cuts permanent, it’s the largest tax bill, the most important, most consequential tax bill that Congress has ever passed because of what it does for people who go out and work hard every day.”

Johnson said the bill pushes “pro-growth policies” and constitutes the “largest savings for the taxpayers in U.S. history.”

India is at the forefront of the global electric mobility revolution, poised to become one of the largest consumers of electric vehicles (EVs). The change is visible on every city street, where electric scooters and auto rickshaws, these workhorse vehicles for millions of people in urban and semi-urban neighbourhoods, are steadily claiming larger sales shares. This can be attributed to friendly policies such as the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles India scheme. Batteries, of course, sit at the centre of this story.

The current scenario

Today’s mass-market of EVs still lean on lithium-ion batteries that carry a noteworthy ecological footprint. Refining lithium, cobalt, and nickel ores leave a heavy mark on the environment: these steps utilise huge amounts of water, wreck local habitats, and spread toxic waste over the land, problems that hurt especially hard in India’s dry states. Due to this environmental damage, producers, whether Indian or not, are now under pressure to demonstrate that they source their minerals responsibly.

The next stage – making the battery cells – is also hungry for energy. As of early 2025, most of India’s power comes from coal, so every battery made on home turf burns coal before the EV even starts its motor. Rough estimates suggest that building one EV battery pack pumps out roughly four tonnes of carbon dioxide. That figure changes when you factor in today’s grid mix. On top of everything, standard methods release N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone, a solvent that adds yet another layer of pollution. The story doesn’t end with production; the fate of a spent battery is equally frightening. India is set to welcome millions of electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers in the near future, which means the country will soon face the giant task of collecting and recycling those old cells.

At present, formal recycling systems for lithium-ion batteries in India are still in their infancy. With much of the work falling to the informal market, valuable metals are lost, and toxic materials can poison people and land alike. These issues are crucial for the long-term growth of India’s EV sector, particularly its large two-wheeler and three-wheeler markets, which contribute significantly to the economy.

Aiming for a sustainable future

Fast-paced innovations are emerging in India to tackle these obstacles more sustainably, especially in cleaner battery manufacturing. One clear trend is the ongoing shift toward new battery chemistries. Lithium Iron Phosphate packs are gaining ground in India because they are cheaper, safer, and last longer, qualities that match the surging demand from two-wheeler and three-wheeler riders; their share of the market is climbing sharply. Sodium-ion cells, however, may prove even more useful for the country since they rely on locally available sodium and sidestep imported lithium or cobalt. Although energy density is still improving, Indian researchers are developing prototypes for grid storage and low-cost short-range vehicles, which aligns neatly with the Make in India vision and enhances national energy security. Solid-state designs, promising higher performance and safety, remain several years from mass production. Meanwhile, battery factories are adopting cleaner, less wasteful methods, strengthening both supply chains and the environment.

Dry-electrode coating technology, which cuts energy use by roughly 30 per cent and avoids toxic solvents, is under global development and could deliver major cost and environmental gains to Indian gigafactories. At the same time, an increasing number of battery makers are committing to renewable power for production. This shift plays an important role in curbing the carbon footprint tied to India’s coal-heavy grid. Modern factories are also adding closed-loop water systems and robust scrap-reclaim programmes, making water savings and waste management core to their strategies.

In addition, repurposing used EV batteries as backup power or grid storage – the long-term stopgap before final recycling – creates sizable economic and environmental value. Digital battery Passports promise to simplify this reuse and recycling by tracking each cell from manufacture through every second of life.

Tackling the challenge

Even with bright prospects, India still faces hurdles on the road to sustainable battery design and manufacturing. Scaling pilot projects such as sodium-ion chemistry or dry-coating lines to full-volume plants remains costly because it demands modern buildings, dependable power, and months of skilled training. Although government production-linked incentive programmes aim to boost local manufacturing, it remains vital that new factories learn about and implement world-class practices from day one.

India must still build a countrywide, efficient framework for collecting and recycling batteries, and that task is far from simple. Formal routes able to manage the flood of spent batteries from two- and three-wheelers – not yet fully scaled – operational or administrative – must merge with informal workers already in the sector, creating tricky logistical and social challenges. At the same time, clear guidelines on supply-chain fairness and the ethical sourcing of imported minerals remain demanding for Indian manufacturers.

Building low-carbon batteries in India remains difficult because the country’s power grid still relies on fossil fuels and only gradually becomes cleaner as new renewable plants come online. Meaningful sustainable manufacturing will follow only after stronger policies reshape the grid. Investors need coherent rules and systematic backing of the existing battery waste management framework if they are to trust the nation with their clean-tech dollars.

All in all, electro mobility is already racing ahead, especially in the two- and three-wheeler segment. Yet that momentum rests on the batteries’ long-term sustainability. Meeting lofty targets requires working recycling networks, a greener grid, ethical supply chains, and bold technological leaps. Positive signs are visible. Thanks to India’s inventive spirit, supportive government direction, and rising passion among makers, progress is unfolding in new battery chemistries, cleaner production routes, and circular-economy models. However, it is imperative to implement a comprehensive battery strategy from birth to death. The sector must pump in capital, elevate research, frame clear policy, build robust infrastructure, and inform consumers.

By working together, India as a nation can link fresh ideas with practical action, tackle tough challenges, cut pollution and carbon emissions, save vital resources, and move toward a self-sufficient, cleaner future that benefits everyone.",https://149356857.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/RW-Trends-8.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 06:06:59.024525

Buying solar panels, private generators or other means of producing their own energy has been out of reach for most of the population.","DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Abdulrazak al-Jenan swept the dust off his solar panel on his apartment roof overlooking Damascus. Syria's largest city was mostly pitch-black, the few speckles of light coming from the other households able to afford solar panels, batteries, or private generators.

Al-Jenan went thousands of dollars in debt to buy his solar panel in 2019. It was an expensive coping mechanism at the time, but without it, he couldn't charge his phone and run the refrigerator.

Syria has not had more than four hours of state electricity per day for years, as a result of the nearly 14-year civil war that ended with the ouster of former President Bashar Assad in December.

Syria's new leaders are hoping renewable energy will now become more than a patchwork solution. Investment is beginning to return to the country with the lifting of U.S. sanctions, and major energy projects are planned, including an industrial-scale solar farm that would secure about a tenth of the country's energy needs.

“The solution to the problem isn’t putting solar panels on roofs,” Syria’s interim Energy Minister Mohammad al-Bashir told The Associated Press. “It’s securing enough power for the families through our networks in Syria. This is what we’re trying to do.”

Some of the efforts focus on simply repairing infrastructure destroyed in the war. The World Bank recently announced a $146 million grant to help Syria repair damaged transmission lines and transformer substations. Al-Bashir said Syria's infrastructure that has been repaired can provide 5,000 megawatts, about half the country's needs, but fuel and gas shortages have hampered generation. With the sanctions lifted, that supply could come in soon.

More significantly, Syria recently signed a $7 billion energy deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and American companies. The program over the next three and a half years would develop four combined-cycle gas turbines with a total generating capacity estimated at approximately 4,000 megawatts and a 1,000-megawatt solar farm. This would “broadly secure the needs” of Syrians, said Al-Bashir.

While Syria is initially focusing on fixing its existing fossil fuel infrastructure to improve quality of life, help make businesses functional again, and entice investors, the U.N. Development Program said in May that a renewable energy plan will be developed in the next year for the country.

The plan will look at Syria’s projected energy demand and determine how much of it can come from renewable sources.

“Given the critical role of energy in Syria’s recovery, we have to rapidly address energy poverty and progressively accelerate the access to renewable energy,” Sudipto Mukerjee, UNDP’s resident representative in Syria, said in a statement announcing the plan.

While the war caused significant damage to Syria's infrastructure, crippling Washington-led sanctions imposed during the Assad dynasty's decades of draconian rule made it impossible for Syria to secure fuel and spare parts to generate power.

“Many companies over the past period would tell us the sanctions impact matters like imports, implementing projects, transferring funds and so on,” al-Bashir said.

During a visit to Turkey in May, the minister said Syria could only secure about 1700 megawatts, a little less than 20%, of its energy needs.

A series of executive orders by U.S. President Donald Trump lifted many sanctions on Syria, aiming to end the country’s isolation from the global banking system so that it can become viable again and rebuild itself.

The United Nations estimates the civil war caused hundreds of billions of dollars in damages and economic losses across the country. Some 90% of Syrians live in poverty. Buying solar panels, private generators or other means of producing their own energy has been out of reach for most of the population.

“Any kind of economic recovery needs a functional energy sector,” said Joseph Daher, Syrian-Swiss economist and researcher, who said that stop-gap measures like solar panels and private generators were luxuries only available to a few who could afford it. “There is also a need to diminish the cost of electricity in Syria, which is one of the most expensive in the region.”

Prices for electricity in recent years surged as the country under its former rulers struggled with currency inflation and rolling back on subsidies. The new officials who inherited the situation say that lifting sanctions will help them rectify the country's financial and economic woes, and provide sufficient and affordable electricity as soon as they can.

“The executive order lifts most of the obstacles for political and economic investment with Syria,"" said Qutaiba Idlibi, who leads the Americas section of the Foreign Ministry.

Syria has been under Washington-led sanctions for decades, but designations intensified during the war that started in 2011. Even with some waivers for humanitarian programs, it was difficult to bring in resources and materials to fix Syria’s critical infrastructure — especially electricity — further compounding the woes of the vast majority of Syrians, who live in poverty.

The removal of sanctions signals to U.S. businesses that Trump is serious in his support for Syria's recovery, Idlibi said.

“Right now, we have a partnership with the United States as any normal country would do,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Al-Jenan is able to turn on both his fans on a hot summer day while he watches the afternoon news on TV, as the temperature rises to 35 degrees Celsius (95 F). He doesn’t want to let go of his solar panel but hopes the lifting of sanctions will eventually bring sustainable state electricity across the country.

“We can at least know what’s going on in the country and watch on TV,” he said. “We really were cut off from the entire world.”

FEOC Restrictions: From the enactment date of the Act, restricted foreign entities and foreign-influenced enterprises will be ineligible for the 45Y/48E/45X tax credits.","On the afternoon of July 4, US President Trump signed the ""Big and Beautiful"" tax and spending bill, marking the official enactment of this controversial legislation.

The bill narrowly passed in the US House of Representatives on July 3, and Trump successfully incorporated the signing ceremony into the celebration of America's ""Independence Day.""

For the wind and solar power industries, the final version of the bill brings short-term relief, as the proposed tax on wind and solar power projects in previous versions has been removed.

Final Version of the Bill Removes Additional Taxation on ""Restricted Foreign Entities""

According to ROTH analysts, the final version passed by the Senate deleted the new excise tax provision targeting projects involving ""Restricted Foreign Entities"" (FEOC). This tax, which was suddenly proposed in the bill version released last week, aimed to tax wind and PV projects that received any assistance from FEOC, sparking strong opposition from the industry.

Additionally, the plan to prematurely terminate the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind and PV projects has been eased. Although December 31, 2027, is still set as the ""commercial operation deadline"" to qualify for the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit under Section 45Y and the Investment Tax Credit under Section 48E of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), exemptions have been preserved for newly commenced projects.

Christian Roselund from Clean Energy Associates posted on LinkedIn, noting that projects can receive ITC/PTC support under current policies as long as they commence within 12 months after the bill's enactment.

Philip Shen, a senior analyst at ROTH, also confirmed, ""If the final version becomes law, projects can commence before mid-2026 and enjoy a four-year construction window with 100% ITC/PTC. This will prevent a massive cliff in project volume in 2028.""

Bill Adjustment Details Clarified: ITC/PTC Timeline Set, 45X Encourages Integrated Manufacturing

Abigail Ross Hopper, President and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), shared a detailed interpretation of the bill on LinkedIn, including: Solar Excise Tax Provision: No new excise taxes will be imposed on solar projects.

25D Provision: The residential solar tax credit will no longer be applicable after December 31, 2025.

45Y/48E Provision: PV facilities that commence construction more than 12 months after the enactment of the Act must be operational by December 31, 2027, to qualify for the tax credit. This provision does not apply to ESS projects.

Domestic Content Incentive: Corrects the drafting error in the IRA regarding the domestic content bonus credit under Section 48E. Projects that commence construction on or after June 16, 2025, must meet a 45% domestic content requirement, which will increase annually.

45X Provision Update: Integrated production of modules must be completed in the same factory, and the final product must be sold to an unrelated third party. At least 65% of the material costs must originate from the US. The definition of ""battery module"" has been redefined. Key mineral incentives will be phased out starting in 2031.

FEOC Restrictions: From the enactment date of the Act, restricted foreign entities and foreign-influenced enterprises will be ineligible for the 45Y/48E/45X tax credits.

Renewable Energy Stocks Rebound, Manufacturers Respond Positively to New Regulations

According to media reports, with the removal of tax concerns, the stock prices of several renewable energy companies have risen. T1 Energy stated that its manufacturing and operational model will align smoothly with the final version of the Act, preserving the transferability and stackability of the 45X provision, which is crucial for domestic PV manufacturers.

T1 Energy said, ""If integrated battery and module manufacturing projects in the US can stack the 45X credit, it will make a substantial contribution to the company's EBITDA.""

“The solution to the problem isn’t putting solar panels on roofs,” Syria’s interim Energy Minister Mohammad al-Bashir told The Associated Press.
Al-Bashir said Syria's infrastructure that has been repaired can provide 5,000 megawatts, about half the country's needs, but fuel and gas shortages have hampered generation.
More significantly, Syria recently signed a $7 billion energy deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and American companies.
Buying solar panels, private generators or other means of producing their own energy has been out of reach for most of the population.","DAMASCUS, Syria -- Abdulrazak al-Jenan swept the dust off his solar panel on his apartment roof overlooking Damascus. Syria's largest city was mostly pitch-black, the few speckles of light coming from the other households able to afford solar panels, batteries, or private generators.

Al-Jenan went thousands of dollars in debt to buy his solar panel in 2019. It was an expensive coping mechanism at the time, but without it, he couldn't charge his phone and run the refrigerator.

Syria has not had more than four hours of state electricity per day for years, as a result of the nearly 14-year civil war that ended with the ouster of former President Bashar Assad in December.

Syria's new leaders are hoping renewable energy will now become more than a patchwork solution. Investment is beginning to return to the country with the lifting of U.S. sanctions, and major energy projects are planned, including an industrial-scale solar farm that would secure about a tenth of the country's energy needs.

“The solution to the problem isn’t putting solar panels on roofs,” Syria’s interim Energy Minister Mohammad al-Bashir told The Associated Press. “It’s securing enough power for the families through our networks in Syria. This is what we’re trying to do.”

Some of the efforts focus on simply repairing infrastructure destroyed in the war. The World Bank recently announced a $146 million grant to help Syria repair damaged transmission lines and transformer substations. Al-Bashir said Syria's infrastructure that has been repaired can provide 5,000 megawatts, about half the country's needs, but fuel and gas shortages have hampered generation. With the sanctions lifted, that supply could come in soon.

More significantly, Syria recently signed a $7 billion energy deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and American companies. The program over the next three and a half years would develop four combined-cycle gas turbines with a total generating capacity estimated at approximately 4,000 megawatts and a 1,000-megawatt solar farm. This would “broadly secure the needs” of Syrians, said Al-Bashir.

While Syria is initially focusing on fixing its existing fossil fuel infrastructure to improve quality of life, help make businesses functional again, and entice investors, the U.N. Development Program said in May that a renewable energy plan will be developed in the next year for the country.

The plan will look at Syria’s projected energy demand and determine how much of it can come from renewable sources.

“Given the critical role of energy in Syria’s recovery, we have to rapidly address energy poverty and progressively accelerate the access to renewable energy,” Sudipto Mukerjee, UNDP’s resident representative in Syria, said in a statement announcing the plan.

While the war caused significant damage to Syria's infrastructure, crippling Washington-led sanctions imposed during the Assad dynasty's decades of draconian rule made it impossible for Syria to secure fuel and spare parts to generate power.

“Many companies over the past period would tell us the sanctions impact matters like imports, implementing projects, transferring funds and so on,” al-Bashir said.

During a visit to Turkey in May, the minister said Syria could only secure about 1700 megawatts, a little less than 20%, of its energy needs.

A series of executive orders by U.S. President Donald Trump lifted many sanctions on Syria, aiming to end the country’s isolation from the global banking system so that it can become viable again and rebuild itself.

The United Nations estimates the civil war caused hundreds of billions of dollars in damages and economic losses across the country. Some 90% of Syrians live in poverty. Buying solar panels, private generators or other means of producing their own energy has been out of reach for most of the population.

“Any kind of economic recovery needs a functional energy sector,” said Joseph Daher, Syrian-Swiss economist and researcher, who said that stop-gap measures like solar panels and private generators were luxuries only available to a few who could afford it. “There is also a need to diminish the cost of electricity in Syria, which is one of the most expensive in the region.”

Prices for electricity in recent years surged as the country under its former rulers struggled with currency inflation and rolling back on subsidies. The new officials who inherited the situation say that lifting sanctions will help them rectify the country's financial and economic woes, and provide sufficient and affordable electricity as soon as they can.

“The executive order lifts most of the obstacles for political and economic investment with Syria,"" said Qutaiba Idlibi, who leads the Americas section of the Foreign Ministry.

Syria has been under Washington-led sanctions for decades, but designations intensified during the war that started in 2011. Even with some waivers for humanitarian programs, it was difficult to bring in resources and materials to fix Syria’s critical infrastructure — especially electricity — further compounding the woes of the vast majority of Syrians, who live in poverty.

The removal of sanctions signals to U.S. businesses that Trump is serious in his support for Syria's recovery, Idlibi said.

“Right now, we have a partnership with the United States as any normal country would do,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Al-Jenan is able to turn on both his fans on a hot summer day while he watches the afternoon news on TV, as the temperature rises to 35 degrees Celsius (95 F). He doesn’t want to let go of his solar panel but hopes the lifting of sanctions will eventually bring sustainable state electricity across the country.

“We can at least know what’s going on in the country and watch on TV,” he said. “We really were cut off from the entire world.”

This figure marks the first time in six quarters that LG Energy Solution has recorded a profit when not including financial benefits from the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit outlined in the US Inflation Reduction Act.
The company posted an AMPC-excluded profit of 1.4 billion won in the second quarter.
LG Energy Solution signed an agreement with the US-based Delta Electronics to supply 4 gigawatt-hour battery cells for ESS applications, enough to power 400,000 US households for a day.
“We are aware of the increased external volatility from major US policy changes, which makes it challenging to predict market demand,” stated LG Energy Solution in a press release.","LG Energy Solution said Monday that it posted a profit in the second quarter of this year, primarily driven by its stellar performance in electric vehicle and energy storage systems in the North American market.

According to the company’s preliminary earnings, from April to June, its operating profit skyrocketed 152 percent to 492.2 billion won ($360.5 million), while sales revenue slipped 9.7 percent to 5.56 trillion won from the previous year.

This figure marks the first time in six quarters that LG Energy Solution has recorded a profit when not including financial benefits from the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit outlined in the US Inflation Reduction Act. The company posted an AMPC-excluded profit of 1.4 billion won in the second quarter.

“Several key factors have contributed to the increase in profit, including rising demand for highly profitable battery products from North American clients, local ESS production in North America and ongoing cost-saving efforts,” said an industry source familiar with the matter, on condition of anonymity.

LG Energy Solution signed an agreement with the US-based Delta Electronics to supply 4 gigawatt-hour battery cells for ESS applications, enough to power 400,000 US households for a day. The company began mass production of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) pouch cells at its Michigan plant last month, marking the first instance of a global battery manufacturer starting large-scale LFP battery production for ESS within the US.

However, the source noted that sales declined during the same period, partly due to conservative inventory management by European automakers and a drop in production volume in China. This adjustment was a strategic move to minimize exposure to US tariffs on Chinese-manufactured ESS products.

As part of its cost-reduction strategies, the battery maker decided to suspend the planned ESS investment in Arizona and instead utilize the Michigan plant earlier in the year. In response to a downturn in the global EV industry, the company also acquired a third joint venture plant with General Motors in Michigan to address the EV battery demand initially intended for LG’s Michigan facility.

“We are aware of the increased external volatility from major US policy changes, which makes it challenging to predict market demand,” stated LG Energy Solution in a press release. “However, we consider the initiation of mass production for new battery chemistry products targeting European EVs and the full-scale ESS production in North America as key opportunities to improve our earnings in the latter half of this year.”

Industry insiders suggest that the recent passage of Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” is expected to have a limited impact on Korean battery companies such as LG Energy Solution. This is because the AMPC is set to conclude at the end of 2031, only a year earlier than originally planned. On the other hand, the $7,500 consumer tax credit for new EV purchases under the IRA has been accelerated to this September from the end of 2032.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is placing staffers who signed a letter of dissent against the Trump administration’s actions and policies on leave.

The EPA says it has placed 144 staffers on administrative leave as it investigates the letter. It’s not entirely clear whether they will face further punishment after the probe.

“The Environmental Protection Agency has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a written statement.

In a letter made public on Monday, current and former EPA staffers said that the administration’s policies “undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

They expressed concerns about five issues in particular, saying that the administration is undermining public trust, ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters, reversing EPA’s progress in America’s most vulnerable communities, dismantling the Office of Research and Development and promoting a culture of fear.

“Your decisions and actions will reverberate for generations to come. EPA under your leadership will not protect communities from hazardous chemicals and unsafe drinking water, but instead will increase risks to public health and safety,” the staffers wrote to Administrator Lee Zeldin.

In response, the EPA said Monday that it would “continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Nicole Cantello, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 704, which represents EPA employees in the Midwest, told The Hill that putting staffers on administrative leave was ” blatant retaliation by the Trump administration.”

“We don’t swear an oath to the Trump administration, we swear an oath to the Constitution and so we don’t feel like we violated that oath or that we did anything wrong by signing this letter,” she said, adding that some of the staffers who were placed on leave are actually “crucial players in trying to implement Trump’s policies at EPA.”

Zeldin told reporters in January that staff who are “not committed” to President Trump’s directives should not be there.

“I don’t believe that anyone should be here at EPA who is not committed to the agency mission and the lawful directives coming from the duly elected president of the United States,” he said at the time.

The EPA previously fired staff who worked on issues related to environmental justice and tackling pollution in underserved communities, arguing that it did not align with the administration’s position on diversity, equity and inclusion.

BBC News, East Midlands

A project to develop a pipeline to capture carbon emitted by cement and lime factories in the Peak District and bury it below the Irish Sea will create hundreds of jobs, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said.

The pipeline will be created to transfer carbon dioxide (CO2) from Derbyshire, Staffordshire and the North West to be stored in the depleted gas fields off the coast of Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.

Reeves said the £59.6m project would modernise the cement and lime industry, create jobs and deliver ""vital carbon capture infrastructure"".

The government said the Peak Cluster project was the world's largest cement decarbonisation project, and would create about 300 jobs.

A further 1,200 temporary roles will be created during construction of the pipeline, the government said, while more than 2,000 jobs in cement and lime production will be ""supported"" by the plan.

In total, the Peak Cluster and Morecambe Net Zero carbon storage projects ""could create and secure 13,000 jobs"".

Carbon capture and storage is where CO2 produced from power stations and industrial processes is captured at source, rather than escaping into the atmosphere and adding to global warming.

Peak Cluster is backed by £28.6m from the government's National Wealth Fund (NWF), and £31m from private partners including Holcim, Tarmac, Breedon, SigmaRoc, Summit Energy Evolution and Progressive Energy.

She said: ""We're modernising the cement and lime industry, delivering vital carbon capture infrastructure and creating jobs across Derbyshire, Staffordshire and the North West to put more money into working people's pockets.""

Cement is the modern world's most common construction material.

But the cement and lime industries are two of the hardest industrial sectors to decarbonise due to the high levels of CO2 emissions generated in the manufacturing process.

Last year, BBC climate editor Justin Rowlatt said if cement was a country, it would be the third biggest source of emissions after China and the US, responsible for 7.5% of human-made CO2.

The Peak Cluster project will prevent more than three million tonnes of CO2 entering the atmosphere each year, the government said.

'Clean energy transition'

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: ""This landmark investment will catalyse our carbon capture sector to deliver thousands of highly skilled jobs and growth across our industrial heartlands, as part of our plan for change.

""Workers in the North Sea and Britain's manufacturing heartlands will drive forward the country's industrial renewal, positioning them at the forefront of the UK's clean energy transition.""

The NWF said it would commit at least £5.8bn by 2030 in hydrogen, carbon capture, ports and supply chains, gigafactories and EV [electric vehicle] supply chains, and steel.

John Flint, NWF CEO, said: ""Substantial private investment, deployed at risk, will be needed to develop and deliver carbon capture projects across the UK.

""Through its investments, the NWF is well placed to support this, especially in hard to abate sectors such as cement and lime, to ensure a pipeline of projects is ready for deployment and the UK is able to meet its ambitious carbon capture targets.""

John Egan, chief executive of Peak Cluster Ltd, said the plan would help to secure ""a sustainable future for the cement and lime industry"", and ""benefit communities across the Midlands and North West of England"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1a98/live/15a85900-5a60-11f0-bb7d-5f9bf28de527.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 03:04:16.973734

I have to admit, when I first moved to Cheyenne, Wyo., I was surprised at the numbers of wind turbines and solar panels that I saw. But knowing how sunny and windy it is in Wyoming it makes sense.

The latest project proposed for Wyoming is a 450-megawatt wind and solar installation covering more than 53,000 acres in Goshen and Platte counties.

Although project organizers and proponents are boasting about the creation of 300 jobs and $150 million in tax revenue, and $250 in revenue for landowners, the locals aren’t so sure the benefits outweigh the potential pitfalls.

In fact, the mayor of Torrington, Herb Doby, told Cowboy State Daily that he would prefer to gas or coal-fired power plants to solar arrays and wind turbines.

Another project that was covered by The Fence Post Assistant Editor Rachel Gabel is called the Sidewinder H2 wind farm and would be located 10 miles west of Lusk, Wyo., on 120,110 acres of land, some of it state land. Also included in that article is the Pronghorn H2 project that would erect 45 turbines east of Casper over 46,000 acres, with 30 percent of that acreage on state-owned land. You can read about these projects on our website at https://www.thefencepost.com/news/wyoming-wind-projects-causing-rifts-in-communities/.

Again, the locals are putting up a fight against these projects, including one rancher whose land borders the Pronghorn H2 project, who has filed a lawsuit against the Office of State Lands and Investment board accusing the board of not following proper procedures when it approved the lease.

There are many reasons to be against these proposals as far as I’m concern mainly because they use up prime farm and pastureland. Who wants these monstrosities in their backyard or to have them obscuring their mountain or pastoral views? What happens when turbines or panels are damaged? What if the company that owns them goes broke?

I believe I mentioned in an earlier editor’s note — after a trip to North Dakota and driving around in the boondocks — about coming across several areas where damaged wind turbines were piled up in fields.

I have no doubt these wind turbines can be recycled, but at what cost and who pays that cost?

There just seems to be too many unknowns at this time so I don’t blame landowners for being skeptical even though they are told they will be paid. But going back to my earlier question, what happens if they company that owns them goes broke?

I’m sure that there are also residents who would prefer renewable energy projects to coal and natural gas projects and I get it. But I hope that everyone, especially those who live in the areas where these projects are being built, get to have their say before construction begins.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/12/2023/01/17220413/Johnson.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 02:01:58.045555

Just last week (week of June 16, 2025), PSE operated under red flag warnings, confronting potential brownouts as high winds and wildfire threats swept through the region, impacting the transmission infrastructure both east and west of the Cascade crest. These events illustrate the growing strain our grid is under from climate-driven natural hazards and rapid load growth.

On June 23, I joined tribal, utility and community leaders at a workshop in Bellingham hosted by researchers from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and the Washington State Department of Commerce. We focused on the 40101(d) Grid Resilience program, an important effort to help Washington utilities fund common-sense infrastructure upgrades that improve reliability, resilience and community well-being.

Our electric grid is one of the largest, most complex, and fragile machines humanity has ever built … and it is now undergoing historic load growth, driven by the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, the electrification of industrial, commercial and building loads, and an explosion in data center demand.

While these transitions, particularly those that displace fossil fuels, are essential for cutting the emissions that worsen climate change, we must upgrade our transmission and distribution systems in parallel to ensure reliability. Hazards like wildfire, smoke, high winds, landslides and cyber threats are only compounding this urgency.

As the Cascadia Daily News highlighted in its article about the Glacier Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) project (CDN, June 17, 2025), this isn’t hypothetical. Built in 2016, the project has been offline for the past two years, a frustrating reality given the current state of the industry. BESS represents precisely the kind of infrastructure we will increasingly need in the years to come.

The good news? The technology has improved dramatically since 2016 to be safer, far more affordable and exponentially more flexible. These systems, when combined with microgrid controls and integrated into a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) or Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) platform, can dramatically reduce outage impacts, restore power faster and increase our grid’s ability to handle variable demand and supply.

To their credit, PSE has been a leader here. They were the first utility in the state to invest in a VPP, and they continue to pursue the right strategies through their Integrated Resource Plan and emerging Integrated System Plan. Through our engagement in the Resource Planning Advisory Group, we’ve seen that PSE is asking the right questions and pursuing innovative solutions. But they can’t do it alone.

Utilities need public support, political alignment, and sustained investment. We must move beyond NIMBY resistance and acknowledge that nearly everything in our economy is powered by electricity (a fulcrum equating to about 3–5% of GDP). Grid resilience is not optional; it’s foundational.

Federal policy must stay the course. As Doug Lewin wrote this week, dismantling the Inflation Reduction Act and its clean energy incentives, as proposed in Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” would drive up costs, slow innovation and undermine reliability.

“Electricity is the new eggs,” he warned. The data is clear: clean energy is the cheapest, fastest-growing power source, and it is crucial to keeping rates low and lights on. As Saul Griffith pitched in his book Electrify: We can have all of the American dream with half the demand for energy if we electrify! This is as much a national security issue as it is an economic and climate issue.

Let’s stop managing decline and start building abundance. I urge state leaders, utilities and communities to double down on the grid resilience solutions already within reach. With the right policies, partnerships and public backing, we can build a power system that’s clean, affordable, reliable and ready for the future.

The investments we make today in our electrical system will directly impact our ability to decarbonize while continuing to grow our economy. These are generational improvements that we are making for our children and grandchildren.

—

At least 78 people have died and dozens remain missing after catastrophic floods wrecked havoc in Texas on Independence Day.

28 of the victims were children, Larry Leitha, sheriff of Kerr County in Texas Hill Country – the epicenter of the flooding – confirmed on Sunday.

The disaster unfolded rapidly on Friday, as torrential rain across central Texas increased the water level of the Guadalupe River by 26 feet (8 meters) within 45 minutes, bursting its banks and destroying everything in its path.

As search-and-rescue operations – some of the largest efforts in recent Texas history – continue, questions have surfaced regarding local authorities’ preparedness and the effectiveness of the warning systems in place.

Some Texas elected officials have blamed the National Weather Service (NWS) for issuing inadequate forecasts and warnings ahead of the storm. But meteorologists and former Weather Service officials have defended the forecasts, saying they were as good and accurate as they could be given the storm’s abrupt escalation, the New York Times reported.

Rapidly intensifying rainfall events like this one are inherently difficult to predict, and forecasters often cannot pinpoint exactly where and when high-intensity and heavily localized rainfall will occur, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain explained. Flash floods, as the name suggests, are also very hard to predict due to their rapid and often sudden onset.

Criticism over the Trump administration’s recent cuts to emergency response and weather forecasting agencies have also mounted over the weekend. Experts have repeatedly warned that these cuts have diminished forecasters’ abilities to predict disasters and provide accurate advance warning.

Meteorologist John Morales said on Saturday there was no evidence that cuts to weather agencies affected weather warnings ahead of the floods, though he added that these cuts “will eventually bite us with unneeded loss of life.” On Sunday, however, Morales pointed out at current vacancies at local NWS offices in key roles such as Meteorologist in Charge and Warning Coordination Meteorologist.

Some experts have warned that these staff shortages, which have doubled since Donald Trump took office in January, might have complicated forecasters’ ability to coordinate responses with local emergency management officials, the New York Times reported.

Trump was quick to reject the claims, while the White House said in a statement to media outlets that claims that NWS cuts were related to the tragedy were “shameful and disgusting.”

Climate Link

There is consensus among climate experts that events like this are becoming stronger and more frequent in a rapidly warming world.

A warmer atmosphere, heated by fossil fuel emissions, can hold more moisture, resulting in heavier downpours. For every 1C that Earth’s atmospheric temperature rises, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can increase by about 7%.

According to Climate Central, the low-level moisture fueling the weather system over Texas came from a warmer-than-average Gulf of Mexico. Sea temperatures here are currently 1-2F above average for this time of year owing to climate change.

“This kind of record-shattering rain (caused by slow-moving torrential thunderstorms) event is *precisely* that which is increasing the fastest in a warming climate,” said Swain. “So it’s not a question of whether climate change played a role–it’s only a question of how much.”

In a statement published Friday, Clean Energy Canada gave three recommendations to the federal government to help deliver affordable EVs to Canadians for less than $40,000.
The group, based out of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said Ottawa should retool its EV mandate by revisiting its near-term targets to help the auto sector “weather this temporary storm” of slumping EV sales.
Starting next year, the mandate would require 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada to be zero-emission vehicles.
The government launched the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program in 2019, which gave car buyers up to $5,000 toward the cost of an electric vehicle.","OTTAWA — An environmental think tank is warning the federal government against repealing its electric vehicle mandate, instead suggesting that politicians should be helping to put more EVs on the road.

In a statement published Friday, Clean Energy Canada gave three recommendations to the federal government to help deliver affordable EVs to Canadians for less than $40,000.

The group, based out of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said Ottawa should retool its EV mandate by revisiting its near-term targets to help the auto sector “weather this temporary storm” of slumping EV sales.

“Any additional flexibility added in the regulation should be designed to achieve other EV-related goals, such as delivering more affordable EVs and building out Canada’s charging network,” says the statement by executive director Rachel Doran and director of public affairs Joanna Kyriazis.

The plea comes on the heels of auto manufacturing leaders meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney last week, in which the CEOs repeated their calls for the mandate to be repealed.

Starting next year, the mandate would require 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada to be zero-emission vehicles. Those also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The target rises annually to 100 per cent by 2035.

Recent data from Statistics Canada suggests EVs accounted for 7.53 per cent of all new vehicles sold in April.

Following the meeting, the head of an organization representing Ford Canada, GM Canada and Stellantis said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" the government would take action on the mandate.

Clean Energy Canada also called on Ottawa to re-fund the EV incentive program, but to be clearer as to when the program will be phased out.

The government launched the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program in 2019, which gave car buyers up to $5,000 toward the cost of an electric vehicle. The program was abruptly suspended back in January when its funding ran out.

It has left many dealerships on the hook for the rebate if they hadn't already sent in their claim before the program ended. The federal government put nearly $3 billion into the program during its lifespan.

""The rebate should start at $5,000 and decline by $1,000 each year, providing consumers and automakers with a well-communicated phaseout that avoids periods of artificially lowered EV sales as buyers await the return of rebates or at least clarity,"" Clean Energy Canada says.

A similar policy is in place in Quebec.

Federal ministers have said in recent months that the government was working toward bringing back consumer incentives on EVs.

Those promises faced criticism from automakers themselves because, without implementing a rebate, EV sales are slumping further, as buyers wait for the rebates to come back.

Clean Energy Canada also called on the federal government to reconsider its approach to cheaper EVs from China, which are subject to a 100 per cent tariff which took effect in October. Ottawa is scheduled to review the measure later this year.

""Allowing in a limited quota of these affordable vehicles while also recognizing EU-approved vehicles … would open Canada’s vehicle market to fill important market gaps, drive innovation and ultimately make our auto sector more competitive,"" the group says.

Located in the Light Industry & Science Park in Calamba, Laguna, Asaba’s facility now runs entirely on clean energy drawn from the Pantabangan and Casecnan hydroelectric plants in Nueva Ecija.

The transition follows a power supply agreement signed in November 2024 with First Gen, marking another milestone in Engtek’s ambitious goal to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 45 percent by 2030.

Reducing carbon emission

“This shift allows us to significantly lower our environmental impact while improving operational cost efficiency,” said Motohiro Asaba, president of Engtek Philippines. “By replacing coal-fired electricity with renewable hydro power, we expect a meaningful reduction in our carbon emissions. In 2024 alone, Asaba Manufacturing recorded 3.64 tCO₂e (tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions.”

The agreement was made possible through the Retail Competition and Open Access provision of the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001, which empowers contestable customers to choose their electricity suppliers.

Sustainability blueprint

The partnership between Engtek and First Gen began in 2022 with the conversion of its first Philippine facility, Engtek Precision Philippines Inc., to geothermal power. The site added on-site solar capabilities in 2023. These multi-source energy strategies reflect Engtek’s broader sustainability blueprint, integrating clean energy adoption, operational efficiency, and environmentally responsible manufacturing.

Carlo Vega, chief engagement officer of First Gen, welcomed the development. “We are pleased to support Engtek in its sustainability journey. First Gen’s goal is to enable our partners to decarbonize without sacrificing operational reliability or efficiency.”

Recognition

A ceremonial Renewable Energy Plaque was presented by First Gen to Engtek Group on June 20, 2025, marking the official renewable energy transition.

Founded in 1995 and acquired by Engtek in 2024, Asaba manufactures precision aluminum and zinc die-cast components for the automotive sector.

First Gen is among the Philippines’ most diversified RE producers with nearly 300 megawatts (MW) of hydroelectric capacity from three facilities. It also runs 25 other RE facilities spanning geothermal, solar, and wind sources, contributing 1,352 MW. It also manages 2,017 MW of natural gas capacity. —Ed: Corrie S.

EV sales are growing, but targets remain out of reach

Approximately one in five – 19.6 per cent - of new cars sold in the UK last year had an electric powertrain, which represents a strong improvement on the previous year. Even though EV sales are growing strongly and outperforming other key European markets, such as Germany, it seems unlikely that the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate of 28 per cent market share in 2025 will be met.

Model proliferation highlights ecosystem pressures

Responding to the growth in domestic demand, there has been a rapid increase in the number of EV models available. At a recent annual test day hosted by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), it was revealed that there are currently 130 electric cars available in the UK, up from 102 in the previous year. As well as bringing cost challenges for manufacturers, this increased competition has underlined the need to support the development of an efficient and effective EV ecosystem.

Discounting is not a long-term solution

The SMMT has recently warned that ‘significant discounting’ of new EVs is not sustainable, and whilst it could boost sales in the short term, ultimately it could undermine the industry’s development. In addition to discounting, advanced technological features, such as ADAS, are now standard across many Chinese imports, which is forcing UK-based makers to keep prices low.

Production timelines shift amid slower-than-expected growth

In a market that is changing rapidly, but not necessarily expanding overall, slower growth than expected in BEV sales has forced some players to delay production timetables in order to focus on making more hybrid or ICE vehicles. For example, Jaguar Land Rover recently decided to delay the launch of its all-electric Range Rover to later this year, and Volvo has stepped back from its plan to focus exclusively on all-electric production by 2030.

Strategic partnerships could accelerate market entry

Some UK-based EV makers may need to modernise their approach when it comes to pursuing a share of the domestic market. For example, instead of trying to out-innovate direct competitors such as BYD, Xpeng, Imodo and Jaecoo, which are already at least 10 years ahead, they should be aiming to forge strategic partnerships. Partnering could accelerate the route to market for new, value-added BEVs that have the advanced technological features that British consumers expect to see as standard.

UK players must leverage domestic advantages

The UK’s fast-developing EV market is much sought after, at a time when other overseas markets are maturing rapidly, and in some ways, this gives domestic manufacturers a competitive edge. Despite lacking a technological advantage, their deep customer knowledge and established sales channels could be vital to adapt Chinese futures to the local market. There could also be an opportunity to innovate collaboratively with Chinese players and build technological capability as they go.

Infrastructure and second-hand market need attention

Greater industry support is also needed to ensure the UK’s EV ecosystem develops at a rate that is commensurate with the growth in sales of BEVs. For example, the availability of charging infrastructure is still patchy in some areas of the country and more investment could help to bolster the used car market, where prices have plummeted. Over time, as the main EV market matures and there is greater liquidity, consumers will become more confident about buying a used EV and prices should begin to stabilise. Increasing battery manufacturing capacity is also critical to producing new EV ranges domestically at a competitive price.

Financing, standards and skills investment are key

There is room for improvement when it comes to financing too. In China, for example, suppliers and investors are used to dealing with startups, but there can be more scepticism in the UK, and this is holding back the pace of change. A clear plan for the sector’s industrialisation could also help to define industry standards in areas such as aftersales and charging infrastructure, allowing manufacturers to focus their investment in the right areas. More focused investment planning could also enable manufacturers to increase their training budgets so then can spend more on upskilling and building industry capability across the value chain.

Partnerships, not price cuts, will secure the future

The cost crunch is impacting the pace of the EV transition, but the UK’s fast-developing EV industry can’t afford to keep discounting. Instead, UK-based makers must focus on partnering to accelerate advancements and invest in a sustainable future.",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/varimk34/ev-charging_adobestock_324584551.jpeg?width=1002&height=564&v=1dbec0ef6ca1e20,N,,2025-07-07 06:07:04.340751

“The connection between the energy sector and vehicle sector is key to electrification and it needs to be driven by software.","As the mining industry moves towards net-zero targets, Vector is providing reliable software that cuts emissions and simplifies operations.

With a legacy that began in the late-1980s, Vector has long been a quiet powerhouse behind the communication systems embedded in modern vehicles.

Vector’s traditional business lies in automotive software development, continuously working closely with global car manufacturers to ensure seamless communication within and between vehicles.

Nowadays, the German-based software specialist is leveraging its longstanding experience and knowledge to bring cutting-edge electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure to heavy industry and the mining sector.

“In 2018, we started to enter the electric charging infrastructure space,” Vector charging infrastructure business development lead Peter Guse told Australian Mining.

“That includes not only road vehicles, but also off-road and off-highway applications. It’s one of our youngest teams but also one of our fastest growing.”

Guse estimates that Vector currently supports around 90,000 global customers, with automotive clients still generating the bulk of annual revenue.

Market leader in high-stakes software

Vector provides mission-critical software and hardware solutions across various domains, including vehicle communication systems, charging infrastructure and charge station management.

The company supplies software stacks to vehicle and EV manufacturers around the world, quickly becoming a market leader in automotive communications.

On the infrastructure side, Vector develops control units for charging stations, vSECC, and software that allows operators to manage multiple charging stations through a centralised system known as vCharM.

Test and simulation tools allow engineers to verify and troubleshoot their systems pre-deployment – a critical step in maintaining reliability. Guse said this high standard of testing is what sets Vector apart.

“We are best suited for mission-critical operations,” he said. “You don’t want your car to stop on a motorway.

“Likewise, our mining clients can’t afford downtime. We bring them the same level of reliable, high-quality software that we’ve refined over decades in the automotive space.”

Vector understands mining

Vector’s entry into the mining sector is well underway. The company secured its first Australian mining contract last year, supplying charging management systems already operating on site.

The company is now working on the development of high-power charging equipment beyond 3000 kilowatts with 1500 volts and 3000 amps, supporting integration from design through to deployment.

“Mining operations are project-based and highly customised,” Guse said. “That means every site is different. We provide hands-on support throughout implementation and offer 24–7 monitoring once the system is live.”

Vector has also played an important role in standardising electric charging since 2009. The company’s experience, combined with first-hand access to evolving standards, has positioned it at the forefront of megawatt charging solutions – a game-changer for large-scale equipment.

“For heavy machinery that requires large batteries and minimal downtime, our systems deliver extremely short charging times with very high charging power,” Guse said. “We will take this a step further with our new controller for Megawatt Charging System, which is already available on the market.”

As the mining industry increasingly adopts decarbonisation, the sector’s unique challenges and demands necessitate Vector’s capabilities and drive for sustainability.

“It was impressive for us to learn how committed the Australian mining sector is to decarbonisation,” Guse said.

“These companies have a high level of technical expertise and are very motivated to drive electrification. That makes them ideal partners.

“Mining customers are highly competent and have very specific requirements. Having a partner who understands both the technology and the industry is key. We’re excited to be part of that.”

Powering the road to net-zero

Though Vector’s specialty remains in software, its roadmap is broadening. The company continues to strengthen its hardware offerings, particularly where software-enabled solutions demand robust integration.

The company’s long-term vision is clear: enable customers to operate more simply, reliably and sustainably.

“Our mission is to simplify the complexity for our customers,” Guse said. “We want to deliver solutions that just work.

“The connection between the energy sector and vehicle sector is key to electrification and it needs to be driven by software. We’re proud to be driving that transition in Australia and beyond.”

It, like the US and some other countries, is searching for a breakthrough in fusion, the Shangri-la of cheap, clean, limitless energy.
Energy dark age For now, the US does retain “energy dominance” in oil and gas.
The US perceived, rightly, that energy dominance is a path to economic and then political dominance.
Outside the Washington bubble, Beijing’s clean energy superiority is neither a bad or good thing, but simply a fact, to which individual, corporate and national manufacturers, and users of energy must adapt.","“We are putting up wind. It does not work. Being very weak and expensive, all made in China. I have never seen a wind farm in China. Why is that?”

It is not hard to guess the speaker. Of course, while US President Donald Trump might not himself have seen a wind farm in China, the country is by far the biggest generator of wind power globally. The White House’s longed-for energy dominance has arrived – but with clean energy it is in Beijing, not Washington.

Wherever you look in the universe of low-carbon energy, you see two worlds: China, and everyone else. In manufacturing, in domestic demand, in deployment, in exports, in investments, increasingly in science and clean-tech innovation, China outstrips the remainder of the planet.

China’s state grid expects 380 gigawatts of solar power and 140 gigawatts of wind to be installed this year. For context, that is almost as much wind capacity, and twice as much solar, as the second-largest user, the US, has – in total.

Costs for renewable energy continue to fall. Batteries, required to back up intermittent wind and solar generation, have also become radically cheaper: lithium-ion batteries costing $137 per kilowatt-hour in 2020 can now be obtained in China for less than $60.

Meanwhile, though US natural gas remains pretty cheap, its price is not far off double that of a year ago. More concerning, long backlogs in gas turbines mean that the favoured option for meeting new electricity demand is going to be slow and costly.

More than half of Chinese motorists now buy an electric car. BYD, NIO, Xiaomi and rivals make inexpensive, increasingly stylish and technically sophisticated EVs, with battery breakthroughs in prospect that would dramatically expand range and cut charging times. They are about to leave the American and European car industries as road kill, unless Detroit and Munich can manage a rapid U-turn.

Rare earth minerals

The Chinese grip over rare earth minerals, used in powerful magnets for electric car motors and wind turbines, receives much press. Less mentioned is China’s dominance of graphite for batteries and elements such as gallium for semiconductors, germanium in electronics, or antimony, used in armaments and making the hard plastic PET. Even in oil, where US technology is generally dominant, China is the leading source of tungsten and industrial diamonds, used for ultra-hard drill bits.

Chinese companies have spent decades building vertically integrated supply chains, that make them robust to volatility in often opaque markets, and able to wage price wars against would-be competitors. They have developed extensive overseas operations for minerals that aren’t common at home, such as cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo and nickel in Indonesia, both important battery components.

China also has a decisive lead in processing technology for rare earths, nickel and other major minerals. Even as rival nations look for mineral deposits elsewhere, China’s near monopoly in processing is likely to prove more durable than its majority share of mining.

Second only to the US in nuclear power generation, it is constructing almost 34 gigawatts of nuclear reactors, far outstripping the 6 gigawatts of the second-largest builder, India. It, like the US and some other countries, is searching for a breakthrough in fusion, the Shangri-la of cheap, clean, limitless energy.

It is also the main producer and leading innovator in a whole range of other key energy technology: for example, electrolysers to produce hydrogen, and ultra-high voltage cables to transmit electricity over intercontinental distances.

The surge in Chinese renewable and nuclear generation, backed up by the still-growing coal fleet, means electricity should be ample and cheap, and it is getting cleaner. Contrast that with the US or Europe, where new electricity is likely to be slow, costly or both, and it provides a potential big advantage for the intensely contested AI terrain.

China is even shooting ahead in space; its Heavenly Questions (Tianwen) programme should make it the first nation to bring rocks back from Mars to Earth for study by 2031, perhaps revealing the first solid evidence of extra-terrestrial life. Meanwhile, the US is dismantling the agency that outshone the Soviet space effort, Nasa, whose own Mars sample return mission is in danger of cancellation.

China invested more than $800 billion in the energy transition last year. This was more than the US, EU and UK put together.

Energy dark age

For now, the US does retain “energy dominance” in oil and gas. That is probably a wasting asset, as US oil output levels out, electric cars and renewables erode demand for hydrocarbons, and China advances its own oil and gas abilities.

The dragon’s rise has been aided by an almost unbelievable series of blunders by its rivals. This story of shame mostly attaches to Washington. The closure of the US Bureau of Mines in 1996, the fake scandal over government loans to solar company Solyndra in 2009, the latest gutting of funding for almost every new energy technology, are milestones in an almost deliberate policy to surrender leadership to Beijing.

The US is now on track to a new dark age where superstition and political ideology replace the quest for scientific truth. It still has unique advantages of risk-seeking capital and tech-savvy entrepreneurs, but their roots of academia, government laboratories and skilled immigration will wither.

The story in Europe is not nearly as bad, but excessive bureaucracy, ideology, fragmentation across national borders, miserly funding for top researchers, an anaemic venture capital scene, painfully slow and expensive construction of big new infrastructure, and the lost decade of the 2010s when clean energy spending stagnated, are all to blame.

The US perceived, rightly, that energy dominance is a path to economic and then political dominance. It was wrong about the dominant forms and country of that energy. Outside the Washington bubble, Beijing’s clean energy superiority is neither a bad or good thing, but simply a fact, to which individual, corporate and national manufacturers, and users of energy must adapt.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/2OWTONTYVOKPDNZQZFM7XNJOJU.jpg?smart=true&auth=067da695fe22d9464cf02f008a608b8da4626b95bc181c56f0e2e8957e5dc951&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-07-07 02:02:01.771189

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and machine learning is driving unprecedented demand for electricity.

This trend is only set to accelerate as the UK seeks to establish itself as a global leader in AI. The UK government has rightly committed to being an ‘AI maker, not taker’. But that ambition comes with consequences.

According to the National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios 2024, data centers could become one of the UK’s fastest-growing sources of demand by the 2030s. AI data centers are used to train the most advanced AI, including frontier models such as ChatGPT, and require vast amounts of energy due to their continuous utilization.

We cannot meet this surge in demand simply by layering data center load on top of an already stretched energy system.

Coordination will be critical

Last month, a report from Aurora Energy Research highlighted that an uncoordinated approach to power sourcing could see power sector emissions increasing by 14 percent, which would directly undermine the UK’s decarbonization goals and drive up wholesale electricity prices.

Instead, we need a coordinated way to unlock the potential of the AI sector. The current approach, where most data centers cluster around areas like London and the Thames Valley, driven by proximity to demand, is unsustainable. These regions are often far from large-scale sources of generation and already face grid constraints such as network connection bottlenecks. Different thinking is viable for data centers geared toward AI workloads, which are less sensitive to latency — the delay of data transfer — and therefore do not need to be sited close to major cities. Without change, we risk slowing down both the deployment of AI infrastructure and our energy transition.

To help mitigate this risk, we should align our energy and digital strategies more closely. That starts with a national framework to strategically site new data centers in areas with available grid capacity, preferably close to power generation sources. Drax Power Station could be one of those locations.

Co-locating data centres and power generation

In 2024 Drax Power Station was the UK’s single largest source of renewable power by output. Our site in Selby, North Yorkshire, provides approximately 2.6 GW of dispatchable power capacity, enough power for five million homes. Unlike intermittent renewables, Drax generates power whether or not the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.

But the site’s potential reaches beyond what it delivers today. We already benefit from planning consents, which — alongside the right policy support and regulatory framework — could allow us to transform Drax into the world’s largest engineered carbon removals facility by installing bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) on two of our generating units. BECCS is unique. It is the only technology that can simultaneously generate renewable power and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. And, significantly, co-locating a data center with the power station could help enable the delivery of this world leading technology.

Large power stations like Drax Power Station were designed to support industrial-scale generation. They have substantial grid connections, large surrounding estates and access to cooling water. These attributes make Drax Power Station uniquely suited for the possibility of hosting a hyperscale data center.

Building data centers next to power stations brings multiple advantages. It enhances system resilience and reduces the risk of plant curtailment. It minimizes energy lost in transmission, something that becomes more pronounced the further electricity has to travel. It also supports the connection of new energy capacity by relieving congestion on the grid queue.

Unlocking this potential, however, will require a rethink of current regulations.

Seizing the opportunity

At present, power stations are restricted from supplying electricity simultaneously to both the grid and a private off-taker such as a data center. These rules were written for a different era, one that did not anticipate intense energy consumers such as AI clusters emerging as a major player in the energy ecosystem.

By unpicking these constraints, we can free up untapped capacity, provide flexible solutions for energy security and support the digital infrastructure needed to drive economic growth.

The government’s recent announcement of AI Growth Zones is a welcome step. If designed properly, this initiative could be the catalyst for a strategic rollout of AI infrastructure across the UK. Rather than clustering growth in already congested urban areas, Growth Zones can enable us to locate data centers where power is plentiful, where local communities stand to benefit from investment and where the grid can accommodate growth.

This is about more than just plugging in servers. It’s about creating a coherent and forward-looking strategy that links where we generate power to where we use it — and recognizes that AI and energy are now inextricably linked.

Subject to clear government policy support and milestones, combining BECCS with a large-scale data center at Drax Power Station could align with this industrial strategy. Together, these developments could create the option for a globally unique proposition: a carbon negative data center — delivering world-leading innovation for the UK and directly countering the perspective that AI growth will mean more carbon emissions.

These projects could protect and create thousands of high-quality jobs in a region that has historically powered the UK but that now faces the risk of deindustrialization as a result of declining heavy industry. A joined-up plan for energy and digital growth can offer lasting economic resilience to communities that need it the most.

At Drax, we are ready to be part of that future. We are already a leading renewable energy generator in the UK and we have the infrastructure and ambition to implement a cutting-edge data center solution at Drax Power Station, helping the country secure its place as a digital leader while keeping the lights on.

It’s time to think smarter about how we build, power and place the critical infrastructure of the 21st century. We must ensure new data capacity is integrated in ways that enhance grid stability without compromising the transition to clean energy or negatively affecting the needs and rights of local communities.

With the right strategy, the UK doesn’t have to choose between energy security and digital growth. We can achieve both.","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/04/AdobeStock_159911861-scaled.jpeg",N,,2025-07-07 00:02:59.718396

With heavy rains still battering Texas on Sunday, politicians are raising questions over whether federal, state and local officials were adequately prepared.
The weather service has been under scrutiny since President Donald Trump took office, with staffing cuts and retirements hitting the agencies.
Many residents in the area said they didn’t receive weather service warnings to their phones before 7 a.m.
From 1980 through 2024, Texas has logged 190 weather disasters costing $1 billion or more, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information .","Before dawn Friday morning, Dalton Rice went for a jog along the Guadalupe River in Kerrville, Texas . Rice, the city manager, finished his run around 4 a.m. as a light rain set in. An hour later, he began receiving emergency calls: the river had flooded out of control.

Torrential rains dumped into the Guadalupe, and in just 45 minutes, it surged about 26 feet (8 meters), according to state officials. Walls of water swept into camps and RV parks that were busy with holiday visitors. At least 70 people have died and dozens of children are still missing in the wake of the catastrophic flooding, which swept through an all-girls summer camp. With heavy rains still battering Texas on Sunday, politicians are raising questions over whether federal, state and local officials were adequately prepared.

Texas has been at the epicenter of extreme weather events in recent years — just in 2024, the state saw Hurricane Beryl knock out power to millions, a powerful windstorm that punched windows out of Houston skyscrapers and a massive wildfire that blazed across the Panhandle. The onslaught of disasters have come as warmer ocean waters and moister air — two results of global warming — provide added fuel to storms. At the same time, climate change has made it harder to predict the speed at which disasters can spin out of control, like in the Maui wildfires that killed dozens in 2023 and the “rapid intensification” that accelerated Hurricane Milton in Florida last year.

In Texas , the loss of life is so astounding that on Sunday search crews had to break down efforts into a grid pattern to recover bodies, Rice said during a press conference.

“We have increased our number of personnel that are navigating the really challenging shores along the bank line,” Rice said. “Our biggest focus is to making sure that we get families reunited with their loved ones.”

In the wake of the tragedy, some politicians are raising questions over the accuracy of weather forecasts issued before the disaster.

“The amount of rain that fell in this specific location was never in any of the forecasts,” Nim Kidd , chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management , said in a briefing in which he also said the National Weather Service underestimated the severity of the storms.

The weather service, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under the Commerce Department , said that emergency management officials were briefed Thursday morning, flood watch was posted in the afternoon and, by 6:22 p.m. local time, forecasters were warning of flash floods and saying rain could fall at rates of more than 3 inches per hour.

There should be inquiries made into whether staffing cuts at the National Weather Service played a contributing role, Representative Joaquin Castro , a Texas Democrat whose district covers parts of San Antonio , said Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union. The weather service has been under scrutiny since President Donald Trump took office, with staffing cuts and retirements hitting the agencies.

Still, Castro emphasized that there’s no clear evidence to show conclusively that the staff cuts impacted the outcome of forecasts.

At least 20.3 inches of rain fell in Streeter, Texas , about 100 miles northwest of Austin and 18 in nearby Hext . In some areas, flooding started around midnight on Friday morning.

Many residents in the area said they didn’t receive weather service warnings to their phones before 7 a.m. But reports are mixed. Andy Brown , a Travis County judge, said during a press conference that he met with survivors in one flooded area who told him they had received alerts from the National Weather Service at noon, before the event began, and then during the night.

Federal officials will look into whether more warnings could have been provided, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a briefing. At the same event, she also said there were federal resources “here on the ground since the beginning of this crisis started, since this weather event did start and even before it came, we were alerted.”

Climate change has driven more extreme rainfall around the world. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water, upping the odds of deluges like the one that struck Texas .

Scientists haven’t yet examined these floods for the fingerprints of climate change. A rapid analysis by Colorado State University climatologist Russ Schumacher shows the six-hour rainfall totals made this a 1,000-year event — that is, it had less than a 0.1% chance of occurring in any given year.

Storms are getting so devastating that insurers are struggling to keep pace with natural-catastrophe claims.

For Texas , this portends outsized consequences — the state alone accounts for roughly a third of all damages caused by extreme weather in the U.S. during the last 10 years.

The state is being walloped by extreme weather again and again. The onslaught illustrates a phenomenon that’s on the rise because of climate change: “compound events,” when the weather goes haywire in back-to-back or overlapping spells. Compound events can be instances of the same kind of dangerous weather — one hurricane on the heels of another, say — or of different types, such as a heat wave coinciding with a drought.

From 1980 through 2024, Texas has logged 190 weather disasters costing $1 billion or more, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information . That’s the highest tally in the country. The U.S. stopped collecting data on these disasters after Trump started his second term.

Friday’s floods likely got a boost from the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, which came ashore in Mexico last week and then sent moisture into Texas . Since 1913, 20 tropical storms, hurricanes or their remnants have caused 15 inches of rain or more across central Texas , the U.S. Weather Prediction Center said.

There more flood warnings and watches across the heart of Texas on Sunday, with heavy rain continuing to fall through the day, said Allison Santorelli , a forecaster at the U.S. Weather Prediction Center. The weather may start to clear by Monday.

Fighter jets whooshed by and a stealth bomber streaked through the air during Friday’s annual White House Fourth of July picnic.

The display of might outside was unmistakable, as was the soft power inside the building.

President Trump signed into law his nearly 900-page “Big Beautiful Bill” of tax breaks and spending cuts, affecting millions of Medicaid recipients while growing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency by thousands of workers.

The Senate passed the bill earlier in the week, while the Republican-controlled House voted 218-214 in favor of it on Thursday evening, with all Democrats and two Republicans opposed.

Now that the bill is in effect, it’s a good time to review what’s actually inside.

Times and Associated Press reporters broke down what the passage of the bill means for the country.

Tax cuts take center stage

The BBB contains roughly $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, according to the Associated Press, and solidified the ones from Trump’s first term.

On the teeter-totter of benefits, the wealthiest families will enjoy an average of $12,000 in tax savings, while the poorest people will have to pay an additional $1,600 a year, on average, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid.

That analysis of the House version of the bill is is according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

While temporarily adding new tax deductions on tips, overtime and auto loans, the bill also adds a $6,000 deduction for older adults making less than $75,000 a year.

The child tax credit is bumped from $2,000 to $2,200, though millions of lower income families will still be unable to get the full credit.

Caps for state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, will quadruple to $40,000 for five years, offering some benefits to residents of higher-taxed states like California.

Businesses will get a break because they will immediately be able to write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research, which some experts say will boost economic growth.

Deportations, a border wall and missile defense

Another $350 billion is being allocated for border and national security, which includes spending on the U.S.-Mexico border and 100,000 migrant detention beds.

ICE will receive funding to offer $10,000 signing bonuses to new employees, with the aim of hiring 10,000 officers and agents.

Immigrants will fund some of these projects by paying new or increased fees, including when they apply for asylum.

In total, the Department of Defense will receive roughly $1 billion in new funding for border security.

Another $25 billion is being set aside for the U.S. to develop its own Israel-type of Iron Dome missile defense system, called the “Golden Dome.”

Clean energy gets pummeled

Previous tax breaks meant to create incentives for wind and solar energy are being hacked dramatically.

One incentive that will soon disappear is the electric vehicle tax break of $7,500 for new vehicles and $4,000 for used ones.

That was supposed to initially expire in 2032. Instead, the credit sunsets on Sept. 30.

How is this being paid for?

Republicans are cutting back on Medicaid and food assistance programs for those below the poverty line.

Many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including those up to age 65, will now have to fulfill an 80-hour-a-month work requirement.

Medicaid patients will also have a new $35 co-payment to contend with.

About 71 million Americans use Medicaid, and 40 million benefit from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly known as food stamps.

The CBO estimates that 11.8 million Americans will become uninsured by 2034, and 3 million more will not qualify for SNAP due to the changes.

For now, American motorists making the switch from gas-powered vehicles to EV can look forward to a $7,500 federal tax credit on new US-made electric cars.

Alongside that, up to $4,000 was available for used EVs.

However, a newly passed federal bill has ended tax incentives for electric vehicles from October.

EVs will become more expensive when tax incentives are dropped

Electric vehicles tend to cost more than their gas-powered counterparts, although they usually work out cheaper in the long run.

In an attempt to offset some of the initial price increase, the United States introduced an attractive tax credit of $7,500 for eligible vehicles.

Some EV owners even managed to boost this further and make even bigger savings.

However, a new bill that was passed by Congress on Thursday (July 3) has scrapped all federal tax credits for electric vehicles.

The tax incentives will end on September 30, meaning if you’ve been eyeing up an electric vehicle, then now might be the time to act before they become more expensive.

Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America told AP that without the incentives, EVs could become unaffordable to lower and middle-income US motorists.

“That’s really disappointing because… they’re just a really great way to reduce transportation energy cost burden,” she told the outlet.

However, she did stress that while the initial cost of EVs will become more expensive, electric car owners will pay less in fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of the vehicle.

Following the introduction of the bill – dubbed the Big Beautiful Bill by President Donald Trump – Jeff Bezos-backed EV startup Slate Autos removed the ‘under $20,000’ expected price tag for its upcoming electric pickup.

The company’s website said the EV was set to cost ‘under $20,000’ but that has since been removed and the FAQ page states the truck is ‘expected to be priced in the mid-twenties’.

What will this mean for EVs in the US?

While none of us can predict the future, it’s thought there might be a bit of a surge in EV sales as motorists hope to make the most of tax credits while they’re on offer.

However, when EVs become more expensive for customers, we may see a slump from carmakers, known as Original Equipment Manufacturers or OEMS, when it comes to EV production in the US.

“To mitigate the financial impact and potential inventory problems, we think OEMs may decide to reduce EV production in the US starting as early as Q325,” UBS analysts told Fortune.

“Longer term, we think OEMs will focus on ICE models in the US market amid the relaxation of emissions rules and lack of EV incentives,” they added.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/ev_sales.png,N,,2025-07-07 01:01:12.581828

Flexible engine power plants provide a reliable and scalable support for balancing renewables – while consuming 20-30% less fuel than traditional gas power stations.
The speed and responsiveness of flexible engine power plants also helps to reduce renewable curtailments when there is too much renewable energy.
Facilitating the lowest cost energy system for businesses and consumers Achieving the lowest cost energy system for consumers requires the overall power system to have the optimal mix of energy sources.","Australia's energy future will be under constant discussion as we get closer to 2030 and we approach key milestones associated with hitting the nation's emissions reduction targets.

One thing is certain, additional capacity will be required to meet demand as Australia looks to retire its coal power stations. While more renewables are coming online, something else is also needed to support the transition – flexibility and balancing capabilities. We need to look no further than South Australia for a successful transition blueprint. In fact, the state has become a global exemplar for renewable energy adoption.

A key part of South Australia's success is flexible engine power plants, alongside renewables and battery energy storage. Currently, the flexible engine power plants run on gas, and help balance the power system during renewable droughts and peak demand periods.

Ultimately, there are three important reasons why flexible engine power plants are the ideal power generation technology to support Australia's transition to renewables:

Providing fast and flexible power support for renewables to facilitate the retirement of coal power stations

Retiring coal power stations is a significant and vital milestone for Australia's 2030 emissions targets and the transition to net zero. As more and more renewables come online, there needs to be sufficient generation capacity in the power system to cover renewable energy droughts, which may last days or weeks. Gas engine-based power plants are perfect for this duty.

Flexible engine power plants provide a reliable and scalable support for balancing renewables – while consuming 20-30% less fuel than traditional gas power stations. The flexible characteristics of these engines, such as the short start-up time, fast ramp-up rate, and shut-down capabilities makes engine-based power plants the best generation technology to follow and support unpredictable and intermittent renewable generation. They are ideal for both minute-level balancing and longer-term balancing by substituting renewable generation during non-renewable periods. Flexible engine power plants can effectively replace renewable generation partially or totally during longer renewable drought periods, providing the confidence and capacity to retire Australia's fleet of coal power station.

The speed and responsiveness of flexible engine power plants also helps to reduce renewable curtailments when there is too much renewable energy. Flexible engines can quickly reduce and adjust their output to match the power demand and variability of renewable sources. This means that engines can ensure that all renewable energy is utilized effectively while still enhancing the grid stability and allowing higher integration of renewables into the system.

Facilitating the lowest cost energy system for businesses and consumers

Achieving the lowest cost energy system for consumers requires the overall power system to have the optimal mix of energy sources. This needs to take into account the different costs and utilisation rates, and constraints of each energy source or technology across the entire power system. A suboptimal mix of energy will result in more curtailment and a more expensive way to meet energy needs during scarcity periods, which raise costs to end-users.

Flexible engines are a proven technology that support balancing renewables. As they are complementary to renewables, they run only when needed - usually during critical balancing periods, such as high demand or renewable droughts. Having engines as part of the system, alongside renewables and energy storage provides the lowest cost energy system for businesses and consumers.

Creating a pathway to zero emissions with future-ready design

Engine power plants are future-proof, because they are essentially fuel agnostic. At the moment, natural gas is the most common fuel in thermal balancing applications, but in the future, it is expected that new renewable, carbon-free fuels will become available for power generation. Recently in AEMO's integrated system modelling plans, natural gas has been highlighted as an integral part of the cost-optimal solution for Australia's energy mix.

However, once the time is right, the flexible engine power plants can transition to sustainable fuels, such as hydrogen, ammonia, ethanol and methanol to help reach the final milestone of a net zero power system. The longevity of the technology and new fuel possibilities are attractive to investors as they will not be stuck with a stranded asset as Australia transitions to a net zero system.

Final thoughts

As 2030 approaches it's important to remember that Australia has a proven blueprint for significant emissions reduction from its energy system. In the state of South Australia, the (not so) secret to its success is renewables, energy storage and flexible engine power plants operating on gas, playing a vital role balancing capacity during times of droughts and peak demand.",https://itbrief.com.au/uploads/story/2025/07/07/compatible_realistic-modern-engine-power-plant-australian-landscape-wind-solar.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 23:03:38.102590

Mike Braun.

The report outlines ten initial proposals to cut red tape, including streamlining certain permits and reducing requirements for emissions reduction plans.

“We need to unleash the productive side of our economy, while protecting and preserving our state’s natural resources,” Braun said in a statement. “Federal laws like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act establish baseline national standards for environmental protection, and states implement those standards within their borders.”

Braun directed IDEM to find ways to lessen regulation to encourage development, following an executive order in March stating Indiana will not exceed federal regulations unless required by state law or deemed necessary by the governor’s office.

David Van Gilder, senior policy and legal director for Hoosier Environmental Council, worries it’s a step in the wrong direction.

“The very premise of the governor’s executive order on this and some others is wrong,” Gilder said. “Many states who have much more protective environmental regulations than Indiana are booming economically, and they are booming because they are protective of their people from environmental harms.”

Today, industry accounts for about a third of global emissions1, with Asia’s share more than doubling in the past two decades.2

To remain competitive in a low-carbon world, industrialisation must now evolve. Governments and businesses are turning to low-carbon industrial parks — practical, scalable platforms to decarbonise operations and future-proof growth.

Sembcorp, a leading renewables player and established industrial and urban solutions provider, is enabling this shift by developing industrial parks where sustainability is embedded from the start. From green master planning and low-carbon construction to clean energy and shared utilities such as water recycling and treatment and circular industrial design, these parks are built to meet the demands of tomorrow’s economy.

Why Low-carbon Industrial Parks Matter

Industrial decarbonisation has become a strategic priority for governments, manufacturers, and investors. Net-zero targets across Asia are accelerating pressure to reduce emissions across operations and supply chains. At the same time, consumers are also demanding sustainable products, and manufacturing is expanding in emerging hubs like Vietnam and Indonesia, driven by reshoring, digitalisation, and growing domestic markets.

Low-carbon industrial parks offer a ready-made platform to meet these demands. With reliable clean energy and shared infrastructure, low-carbon industrial parks help businesses reduce carbon exposure, strengthen supply chain resilience, and sharpen competitive advantage. These parks also support data-driven compliance with ESG standards — increasingly critical for global trade and investment.

Beyond emissions, these industrial ecosystems promote responsible land use, inclusive employment and resource resilience — reducing strain on local grids and water systems while enhancing long-term viability.

Retrofitting the Past, Building for the Future

Many existing industrial parks in Asia were built for speed, not sustainability. These legacy sites still depend heavily on fossil fuels and lack the infrastructure needed for low-carbon operations.

Retrofitting them requires targeted investment in renewables, energy storage and digital utilities. While the long-term gains are clear, upfront capital costs remain a barrier — especially for small and mid-sized manufacturers. Innovative financing and public-private partnerships are essential to overcoming these barriers.

Equally vital is long-term regulatory clarity. Harmonised emissions standards, stable incentives, and cross-border policy alignment are essential to unlock capital and accelerate action. Without these, industrial decarbonisation will stall.

Success depends on collaboration. Developers, tenants, energy providers, and governments must work together. Integrated developers like Sembcorp are uniquely positioned to deliver the shared infrastructure and turnkey solutions that make low-carbon transitions cost effective and achievable at scale.

Sembcorp’s Approach: Scaling Low-carbon Industrial Parks across Asia

With over 35 years of experience, Sembcorp has built a track record across Asia’s fastest growing markets — from Vietnam and Indonesia to China.

We have developed 24 industrial parks across 14,800 hectares, hosting over 1,000 tenants and drawing nearly US$58 billion in investment.3 By 2028, we aim to expand to 18,000 hectares and grow our leasable industrial space to 1.5 million square metres — supporting the next wave of sustainable manufacturing.

President Donald J. Trump on July 4 signed into law H.R. 1, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The bill was passed by the House on July 3 by vote of 218 to 214. The bill was passed by the Senate on July 1 by a vote of 51 to 50, with the tie-breaking vote of Vice President JD Vance.

H.R. 1 contains significant tax law changes with various effective dates affecting individual and business taxpayers, including some provisions with effective dates tied to the bill’s July 4 date of enactment.

Key tax provisions featured in H.R. 1 include:

Permanent extension, with modifications, of individual, business, and international tax provisions enacted as part of the 2017 TCJA that were set to change at the end of 2025.

Modified versions of individual and business tax relief proposals advanced by President Trump, and other new tax relief measures, including a temporary increase in the cap on individual itemized deductions for state and local taxes to $40,000 for tax years 2025 through 2029.

New or modified incentives for business investment and certain Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean energy tax credits with various effective dates, including some provisions with begin-construction date and placed-in-service date requirements.

Various limits on business and individual tax deductions, which are intended to offset part of the cost of the legislation.

In addition to significant tax law changes, the bill approved by Congress includes increased funding for immigration control and national defense, and spending reductions affecting Medicaid and other federal programs. The bill also includes a provision to increase the federal government’s current $36.1 trillion statutory debt limit by $5 trillion.

The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has projected that the tax provisions of H.R. 1 will reduce net federal revenues by $4.475 trillion between 2025 and 2034 under the current-law baseline used by the House. JCT staff tax estimates that the same tax provisions would reduce net federal revenues by $715.2 billion over 10 years under a current-policy baseline used by the Senate, which assumes no revenue effect for maintaining expiring TCJA provisions.

Taking into account overall changes to federal revenue and spending, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected that H.R. 1 will increase annual federal deficits by $3.4 trillion between 2025 and 2034. CBO staff projects that H.R. 1 would reduce federal deficits by $0.4 trillion under a current-policy baseline.

Business leaders and individuals will need to evaluate the potential effect of H.R. 1 as passed by the Congress on the US economy, business operations and investments, and household finances.

And as uncommon as such an exhibition might be, it’s even more rare to have the CEOs of each company—GROB Group CEO German Wankmiller and Dürr AG CEO Jochen Weyrauch—on hand to help explain what you’re seeing. That’s what happened this year.

The collaboration, which began in 2022, brought together complementary expertise to create a comprehensive battery production solution. “With our expanded portfolio of machines and systems, we jointly cover almost the entire value chain for battery cell production with our own technologies,” noted GROB CEO Wankmiller.

Attendees who visited the joint Dürr and GROB booth at the Stuttgart Exhibition Center were able to examine a physical 3D model of the concept factory alongside complimentary battery production technologies from both companies.

Innovative technologies bring dramatic efficiency improvements

At the heart of their concept factory was an innovative Activated Dry Electrode process, which represented a departure from conventional manufacturing methods. Instead of using traditional slurry, this approach utilizes a dry-mixed active material pressed into a free-standing film using calender machines, which was then laminated onto collector foil.

Dürr’s Weyrauch highlighted the transformative nature of this approach: “Our concept factory, and particularly the dry coating process, represents the next generation of battery cell production.”

The elimination of the drying process and solvent treatment delivers substantial benefits beyond just space and energy savings. The free-standing film improves material efficiency by allowing excess film to be completely recycled before lamination. Additionally, the process enables direct measurement of coat weight after calendering, providing better control of coating thickness. The lamination process requires less force than wet coating, preventing foil deformation and improving downstream processing.

GROB's contribution to the partnership includes their next-generation Z-folders with integrated notching processes. This technology achieves higher performance in a smaller footprint while maintaining high reliability. The separator is guided over minimal deflection rollers with consistent, low web tension, while a high-quality magazine buffer system for electrodes helps the system achieve 95% availability.

Dürr's novel approach to electrolyte filling allows battery cells to be filled in a single step without residual gas. Unlike conventional methods, their process injects electrolyte directly into cells at pressures up to 30 bar—two to three times higher than industry standards. This design enabled precise dosing while shortening both the filling process and subsequent electrolyte penetration into the active material.

Digital integration and conventional process improvements round out the offering

The hardware innovations were complemented by comprehensive digital solutions spanning the entire production process. Even before manufacturing begins, a digital twin enables simulation of the entire factory, accelerating on-site implementation. This simulation data feeds into MES/MOM software from Dürr's subsidiary iTAC, which controls and plans all production steps while providing critical traceability and quality analysis functions to prevent manufacturing errors.

While the dry coating process represents their most radical innovation, Dürr also showcased significant improvements to conventional wet coating technology. These included automated coating stations and slot dies forming a closed control loop for layer thickness, resulting in faster production start-up and reduced scrap rates.

Their laser dryers achieve 50% faster web speeds with improved energy efficiency. After drying, electrode coatings are densified using calendering machines from Dürr's subsidiary Ingecal, featuring “Dynamic Gap Control” that measures roller distances with 0.5 μm accuracy for uniform layer thickness. These calenders are versatile enough for both wet and dry coating applications.

Both Dürr’s Weyrauch and GROB’s Wankmiller acknowledge the current ascendancy of China-based battery makers such as CATL and BYD—companies that lead the world in production of high-quality, low-price point batteries. However, both asserted that the way for European companies to successfully compete is with groundbreaking, integrated production technology that saves space, energy, and costs—as exemplified by their shared factory concept.

The U.S. Congress recently approved comprehensive tax and budget legislation that brings significant changes to various sectors, particularly the electric vehicle industry. Understanding these changes is crucial for investors monitoring commodities like tin that are integral to advanced manufacturing and energy transition minerals.

Electric Vehicle Tax Credit Expiration

The most notable provision for commodity markets is the expiration of the Electric Vehicle (EV) tax credit on September 30, 2025. This impending deadline creates substantial ripple effects throughout the new energy vehicle (NEV) supply chain.

Current incentives have been instrumental in accelerating EV adoption across the United States. With their removal, industry analysts project a potential rush in purchases before the deadline, followed by a likely slowdown in demand. This pattern could significantly impact tin consumption, as EVs require approximately 1.8-2.5 kg of tin per vehicle, primarily in soldering applications for circuit boards and electrical systems.

""The EV tax credit expiration represents a critical inflection point for materials demand in the automotive sector. Manufacturers are preparing for potential market volatility by adjusting production schedules and raw material procurement strategies."" — Industry analysis from Shanghai Metal Market (SMM), July 2025

For investors and market participants, this timeline creates a clear marker for potential demand shifts in critical minerals, including tin, which is essential for the electronics components that power electric vehicles.

Comprehensive Budget Reforms

Beyond the EV tax credits, the legislation contains broader fiscal measures that may indirectly affect commodity markets:

Revised industrial development incentives with emphasis on domestic manufacturing

Modified tax treatment for mining operations and resource extraction

Adjusted depreciation schedules for heavy industrial equipment

According to the SMM report, the U.S. Treasury Secretary has indicated that ""trade agreements would be signed intensively before July 9, 2025,"" suggesting concentrated diplomatic efforts that could reshape international supply chains for critical minerals.

These trade policy shifts introduce new uncertainties to global commodity markets, particularly for materials like tin that move through complex international supply networks. The potential for new tariffs, quotas, or preferential trade terms could significantly alter established pricing dynamics. Recent tariff impact analysis suggests commodity markets are especially sensitive to such policy changes.

How Is the Global Tin Supply Chain Currently Positioned?

The current tin supply landscape reflects a complex interplay of regional production challenges, inventory management, and strategic positioning by major market participants.

Supply Constraints in Key Production Regions

China's Yunnan province, a critical tin production hub, continues experiencing tightening ore availability. This constraint comes at a particularly sensitive time for global markets already navigating complex supply dynamics.

Multiple factors contribute to this tightness:

Environmental compliance measures limiting extraction volumes

Labor shortages affecting consistent production output

Processing bottlenecks at key refinement facilities

Adding to these challenges, several major smelters have announced maintenance shutdowns or production reductions. These scheduled disruptions, while typically planned, compound existing supply pressures and create potential for spot market volatility.

Myanmar's production outlook remains one of the market's most significant variables. As the world's third-largest tin producer, contributing approximately 40,000-50,000 tonnes annually in recent years, any resumption timeline shifts can dramatically impact global availability.

Inventory Dynamics

Current market intelligence indicates social inventory levels have shown a slight buildup in recent weeks. This modest accumulation represents a shift from the extreme tightness observed in previous quarters but doesn't yet signal market oversupply.

Industry analysts project that inventory accumulation pressure is likely to persist in the short term, influenced by:

Seasonal demand softening in electronics sectors

Cautious purchasing behaviors from end-users

Strategic positioning ahead of anticipated trade policy shifts

Most downstream buyers have implemented just-in-time procurement strategies, minimizing their exposure to price volatility while maintaining operational continuity. This approach—characterized by smaller, more frequent purchases—has become increasingly common as market participants navigate uncertain supply conditions.

""The current inventory buildup should be viewed within context—it represents normalization rather than oversupply. Strategic stocks remain tight by historical standards, creating potential for rapid price movements should any additional supply disruptions occur."" — SMM Analysis, July 2025

What Factors Are Influencing Current Tin Demand?

Understanding the complex demand environment for tin requires examining both seasonal patterns and sector-specific dynamics that collectively shape market conditions.

Seasonal Industry Patterns

The photovoltaic (PV) sector has recently completed its installation rush period, resulting in a predictable decline in order volumes. This pattern follows typical solar industry cycles, where installation activity peaks during specific seasonal windows and then moderates.

For tin markets, this cyclicality is significant because solar panel manufacturing requires substantial amounts of tin for soldering connections and component assembly. Modern solar cells utilize approximately 7-11 grams of tin per panel, primarily in the form of specialized solders designed for high-temperature resilience.

Simultaneously, the electronics industry—historically tin's largest consumption sector—has entered its traditional off-season. This predictable lull occurs as manufacturers complete inventory buildups for later-year consumer product launches and holiday season demand.

This dual seasonal softening creates a temporary demand plateau that influences current market sentiment and pricing dynamics.

Sector-Specific Demand Analysis

While electronics and solar applications show seasonal moderation, other sectors present a more stable demand profile:

Tinplate manufacturing maintains consistent consumption patterns, supported by steady food packaging requirements

Chemical applications continue showing resilience, particularly in PVC stabilizers and catalysts

Specialized solders for industrial applications demonstrate ongoing demand strength

The spot market currently exhibits sluggish transaction volumes as downstream enterprises adopt increasingly cautious purchasing strategies. This hesitancy reflects both price sensitivity at current levels and strategic inventory management in anticipation of potential supply chain shifts.

End-users display strong wait-and-see sentiment, minimizing purchases beyond immediate operational requirements. This behavior pattern, while logical from individual company perspectives, collectively contributes to market inertia and complicates price discovery mechanisms.

""Current demand patterns reflect rational actor behavior in an uncertain policy environment. Procurement managers are balancing operational continuity against price risk, resulting in compressed transaction volumes despite fundamentally unchanged consumption."" — SMM Market Analysis, July 2025

What Is the Price Outlook for Tin in the Coming Weeks?

The tin market currently sits at a critical juncture where multiple technical and fundamental factors suggest continued price stability despite underlying supply constraints.

Market Positioning Factors

Prices are expected to continue trading sideways at elevated levels in the near term. Technical indicators suggest resistance at current price points, with SMM analysis pointing to limited downside pressure despite seasonal demand softening.

This price stability reflects several counterbalancing forces:

Upward pressure from persistent supply constraints in key producing regions

Downward pressure from seasonal demand moderation in electronics and PV sectors

Stabilizing influence from strategic inventory management by major market participants

Historical patterns indicate potential for continued price resilience even as the market navigates current supply challenges. Previous episodes of production disruption in major tin-producing regions have typically been absorbed without extreme price volatility, particularly when inventory levels provide adequate buffers.

Risk Assessment for Investors

For market participants, several key monitoring points demand particular attention:

Myanmar production developments represent perhaps the single most significant supply variable in the current market. Any concrete timeline for output resumption could trigger immediate price responses.

Seasonal demand recovery patterns across end-use sectors will determine how quickly current inventory buildups might be absorbed. Electronics industry purchasing typically begins accelerating in late summer as production ramps for year-end consumer product launches.

Macroeconomic policy shifts, particularly from U.S. fiscal and monetary authorities, could alter market sentiment and investment flows into industrial metals more broadly.

Current risk-reward profiles suggest maintaining strategic positioning rather than aggressive directional bets. The combination of reasonable inventory levels and balanced near-term fundamentals creates an environment where extreme price movements appear less likely than continued rangebound trading.

""The technical picture suggests consolidation rather than correction. Support levels remain intact despite recent softening, indicating market participants view current valuations as reasonable given the underlying supply-demand balance."" — SMM Technical Analysis, July 2025

How Might US Trade Policy Impact Global Tin Markets?

The potential for significant trade policy shifts introduces a critical variable for tin market participants to monitor, with implications extending throughout global supply chains. The US-China trade war impacts continue to create ripple effects throughout commodity markets.

Potential Trade Agreement Implications

The Treasury Secretary's announcement regarding intensive trade agreement signings before July 9, 2025, creates a defined timeline for potential market disruption. These diplomatic initiatives could introduce new frameworks governing critical mineral flows between major economies.

Possible outcomes include:

Introduction of new tariffs or trade barriers affecting mineral supply chains

Preferential terms for strategic partners in critical mineral procurement

Enhanced traceability requirements for conflict minerals and environmentally sensitive materials

Historical precedent suggests that major trade policy shifts often trigger temporary price volatility as market participants recalibrate expectations and adjust supply chain strategies. The tin market, with its globally distributed production base and manufacturing applications, remains particularly sensitive to such policy changes.

Global Market Uncertainty Factors

Beyond immediate price effects, trade policy shifts may necessitate supply chain reconfiguration as market participants adjust to new regulatory frameworks. These adaptations could include:

Geographic diversification of procurement strategies

Investment in alternative sourcing regions

Development of recycling and recovery technologies to reduce import dependencies

The potential for regional price disparities depending on trade agreement specifics creates both challenges and opportunities for market participants with global operations. Companies with flexible sourcing capabilities may gain competitive advantages during transition periods.

For investors, monitoring diplomatic signals and early drafts of trade agreements becomes essential for anticipating market impacts. The concentrated timeline announced for agreement signings suggests an accelerated implementation schedule that could compress adjustment periods.

""Trade policy changes historically create both winners and losers in metals markets. The key differential factor is often not the policy itself but how quickly market participants can adapt their operational models to the new reality."" — SMM Policy Analysis, July 2025

What Are the Current Supply-Demand Fundamentals for Tin?

A comprehensive assessment of tin's market position requires detailed examination of both production constraints and consumption patterns across diverse end-use sectors.

Production Constraints Analysis

The ongoing supply tightness in major producing regions represents one of the market's defining characteristics. Yunnan province continues experiencing restricted ore availability, creating persistent challenges for smelters dependent on local feedstock.

Maintenance shutdowns at key smelting facilities compound these constraints. While routine maintenance represents a normal operational practice, the timing of current shutdowns—coinciding with already tight supply conditions—magnifies their market impact.

Several significant market participants have implemented production cuts in response to these challenging conditions. These reductions, while individually modest, collectively contribute to a restricted supply environment that provides fundamental support for current price levels.

The industry appears to be navigating a complex balance between operational sustainability and market responsiveness. Extended production at maximum capacity during tight ore availability periods can deplete strategic reserves and create longer-term operational vulnerabilities.

Demand Sector Breakdown

The electronics industry, currently in its seasonal downturn, continues to represent tin's largest consumption category. This sector accounts for approximately 47-52% of global tin usage, primarily in soldering applications for consumer electronics, telecommunications equipment, and automotive systems.

The photovoltaic sector, having completed its installation rush period, now shows declining order volumes. This pattern follows established seasonal trends but occurs against a backdrop of secular growth in renewable energy deployment globally.

Tinplate and chemical applications maintain more stable demand profiles, providing baseline consumption that helps offset volatility in other sectors. These traditional applications represent approximately 14% and 17% of global tin usage respectively, offering consistent demand cushions during cyclical downturns in electronics.

Emerging applications represent potential growth areas that could reshape demand dynamics in coming years:

Energy storage systems utilizing advanced tin-based anode materials

Semiconductor manufacturing requiring high-purity tin compounds

Medical applications leveraging tin's antimicrobial properties

These developing market segments, while currently representing small portions of total demand, offer diversification potential that could reduce tin's historical dependence on electronics cycles.

How Should Investors Approach the Tin Market Under Current Conditions?

Strategic positioning in the current tin market requires balancing short-term tactical considerations against longer-term fundamental outlooks.

Risk Management Strategies

Market participants should maintain a cautious operational approach given current price levels and mixed signals from fundamental indicators. This conservative stance doesn't necessarily imply bearish positioning, but rather suggests calibrated exposure and defined risk parameters.

Key supply indicators demand particular attention, with Myanmar production resumption timelines representing perhaps the single most significant variable capable of shifting market balance. Any concrete developments regarding output restoration would warrant immediate reassessment of positioning.

Seasonal demand recovery patterns across major end-use sectors provide critical inflection points for price trajectories. Electronics industry purchasing typically begins accelerating in late summer as manufacturers prepare for year-end consumer product launches. Early indicators of this cyclical upturn could signal appropriate entry points for position building.

Macroeconomic policy developments, especially U.S. trade initiatives, create an additional layer of market uncertainty requiring active monitoring. The critical minerals order and the concentrated timeline for trade agreement signings before July 9 presents a defined horizon for potential disruption that should factor into position timing and risk exposure calculations.

Investment Timing Considerations

Current price levels suggest limited immediate upside potential absent new supply disruptions or unexpected demand surges. Technical indicators point toward consolidation rather than continuation, creating an environment where patience likely represents the optimal near-term approach.

Supply constraints provide fundamental support against significant price declines, creating an asymmetric risk profile that favors maintaining strategic long exposure while avoiding aggressive new commitments at current levels.

Potential entry points may emerge following clarity on Myanmar production or seasonal demand improvements. These catalysts could create defined risk-reward scenarios more favorable than current conditions, which feature elevated uncertainty across multiple fundamental variables.

For investors with longer time horizons, current market conditions offer investment opportunities insights at reasonable valuations relative to production costs and historical price ranges. Incremental position building during periods of technical weakness represents a disciplined approach to building strategic exposure.

""The current market environment rewards patient capital with defined risk parameters. Strategic positioning now creates optionality for more aggressive tactical adjustments when fundamental catalysts materialize in coming months."" — SMM Investment Analysis, July 2025

FAQ: Understanding Tin Market Dynamics

How does the US EV tax credit expiration affect tin demand?

The September 30, 2025 expiration of EV tax credits will likely create a near-term demand surge followed by potential moderation in electric vehicle purchases. This pattern matters for tin markets because each electric vehicle contains approximately 1.8-2.5 kg of tin in various electronic components and solder applications.

While the direct impact on overall tin consumption remains modest—EVs currently represent roughly 3-4% of global tin demand—the growth trajectory of this segment makes it increasingly significant for long-term market projections. The tax credit expiration creates a defined timeline that could alter adoption curves and manufacturing schedules.

What regions are experiencing the most significant tin supply constraints?

Yunnan province in China and Myanmar are currently facing the most notable supply constraints. These regions collectively account for approximately 30-35% of global tin production, making their output challenges particularly significant for overall market balance.

In Yunnan, environmental compliance measures and ore grade challenges have created persistent production headwinds. Myanmar's situation involves more complex political and operational factors that have disrupted established export patterns, creating substantial uncertainty regarding resumption timelines.

Why are downstream buyers maintaining a wait-and-see approach?

Buyers are exhibiting caution due to a confluence of factors:

Elevated price levels relative to historical averages

Uncertain demand outlook in key sectors like electronics and photovoltaics

Potential market impacts from upcoming U.S. trade policy changes

Seasonal consumption patterns suggesting limited immediate requirements

This cautious approach manifests as just-in-time procurement strategies, minimized inventory holdings, and reduced spot market participation. While individually rational, these behaviors collectively contribute to market inertia and compressed transaction volumes.

What factors could trigger a significant price movement in the tin market?

Several potential catalysts could break the current consolidation pattern:

Production resumption in Myanmar would likely create immediate downward pressure if volumes returned to historical levels

Unexpected changes in Chinese environmental regulations affecting smelters could rapidly tighten already constrained supply

Significant shifts in electronics industry demand, particularly earlier-than-expected purchasing for year-end product cycles

Major trade policy developments affecting critical minerals could create both opportunities and challenges depending on specific provisions

These trigger events all feature definable probabilities but uncertain timing, creating the complex risk assessment environment that currently characterizes the tin market.

How do seasonal factors influence tin demand patterns?

The electronics industry, which consumes approximately 47-52% of global tin production, typically experiences reduced activity during summer months before accelerating in late Q3 for year-end product launches. This cyclicality creates predictable demand softness during the current period.

Similarly, the solar installation sector has seasonal peaks and valleys that directly impact tin solder demand. Installation activity typically concentrates during favorable weather periods, creating surge demand followed by moderation as projects complete.

Understanding these cyclical patterns provides essential context for interpreting current market signals and distinguishing between seasonal fluctuations and more fundamental shifts in consumption trends.

The WA government has set a 2030 deadline for the wind-down of coal-fired power generation, and has backed onshore wind as a key part of the state's new electricity mix.

Projects planned for southern WA include wind farms around West Arthur, Narrogin, Williams, Boddington and Scott River.

However, many are yet to begin construction and a developer says the 2030 deadline may need to be extended to keep the lights on.

In Boddington, about 130 kilometres south of Perth, the companies behind the Marradong Wind Farm are yet to make a final investment decision.

The 45-turbine, 300-megawatt project is a collaboration between developers Wind with Purpose and Quenda Wind Power.

The latter is a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation, which partially owns the struggling Bluewaters Power Station in Collie.

Quenda business development head Daniel Kurz said meeting the state government's 2030 ""line in the sand"" would be challenging.

Wind with Purpose chief executive Chris Kearney said while the project was currently on track to be operational by 2029, there was not much wiggle room.

""If we don't hit our targets for getting this project online, and likewise if Western Power don't have the infrastructure to connect these projects, then the reality is coal-fired power plants may have to stay online a few years longer than planned,"" he said.

Extra transmission needed

The Marradong Wind Farm would use existing power infrastructure in the area.

But 100km down the road, RES Australia's wind farm — more than twice the size of the Marradong project with 110 turbines — would rely on transmission infrastructure being upgraded.

Once operational, the project in Dardadine, 197km south-east of Perth, would generate enough electricity to power up to 450,000 homes.

It is also yet to progress beyond the consultation and assessment stage.

Development director Greg Wilkinson said construction should start by 2028, with a view to being fully operational by the end of 2031.

But he said if the project went ahead and the power infrastructure was ready, he was willing to bring it forward.

""We're working with Western Power and Powering WA to ensure that we can get this project up and powering WA homes as soon as we can,"" Mr Wilkinson said.

The Clean Energy Council's Chris O'Keefe said a lack of transmission lines was a sticking point for the industry.

""The WA government needs to build 250 kilometres of new transmission lines,"" he said.

""[Otherwise] we might have a situation where we're generating two or three gigawatts of onshore wind, yet there's not enough transmission to get it to the places where it needs to get to.""

Government promises expansion

The Cook government's latest budget included $584.3 million to be spent on network upgrades and the expansion of the Clean Energy Link.

It has also promised to set up transmission manufacturing hubs in Perth and the South West.

The WA government said it was not relying on a controversial, federally backed offshore wind project to be ready by 2030.

But Energy Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said onshore wind would be ""critical"" heading into 2030.

""We do support a sensible mix of renewable energy and big battery storage … [and] we will still continue to need gas as a firming fuel as we exit coal,"" she said.

Ms Sanderson said she would work with proponents on what was needed.

However, Mr O'Keefe said he was worried work was not happening quickly enough.

""They need to crack on with that if that 2030 target is to be met.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d3832d45e67fcc6d0caa750992d3a05e?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1080&cropW=1920&xPos=0&yPos=181&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-07-06 22:03:58.801364

The law also targets “foreign-influenced” entities, disqualifying those with ≥25% foreign ownership, ≥15% debt exposure, or foreign control over governance or operations. Treasury is authorized to determine whether an entity is under “effective control” based on contracts or licensing agreements that grant decision-making power over production, output, or site access.

Critical minerals provisions were also amended. The legislation newly designates metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, as a critical mineral eligible for the Section 45X production credit, at a rate of 2.5% of production costs through December 31, 2029. At the same time, the bill establishes a phaseout for other critical minerals beginning in 2031, with the credit expiring after 2033.

Producers of critical minerals or eligible components face additional compliance hurdles. The law imposes FEOC restrictions that deny credits to taxpayers determined to be foreign-influenced, or whose components are made under “effective control” or with inputs that exceed specified thresholds from prohibited foreign entities. “Facilities using prohibited foreign inputs beyond threshold cost ratios will forfeit credit eligibility,” the White & Case team notes.

These FEOC restrictions are retroactive for ownership-related disqualifications beginning in the year of enactment and prospective for material assistance, taking effect for construction beginning after December 31, 2025. The law also prohibits the transfer of tax credits to foreign-controlled entities and introduces penalties for false certifications regarding domestic content.

They refuse to acknowledge that mining, cropland and habitat destruction, toxic wastes and other adverse effects make these electricity sources anything but clean, renewable or sustainable — or that wind and sunshine cannot provide raw materials for 6,000-plus essential products that come from petrochemicals: paints, plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, clothing and much more.

Their claim that wind and solar power are cheaper than coal, gas or nuclear power ignores that these electricity generators are weather-dependent and intermittent — and must be backed up by coal, gas and nuclear power, or by massive fire-prone battery installations.

Those multi-billion-dollar backup generators double or triple electricity costs, helping explain why British and German families pay three times what typical American families do.

Despite enormous subsidies, wind and solar companies and installations frequently fail. Sunnova Energy is the latest solar company to file for bankruptcy. California’s Ivanpah solar plant is also going belly-up. Ivanpah’s $2.2 billion “concentrated solar thermal power plant” uses 347,000 75-square-foot mirrors on 3,500 acres to generate electricity when the sun shines. The state’s Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant generates 20 times more electricity 24/7/365 from one-fifth the acreage.

Power outages are an equally serious problem.

A basic energy rule states that the more a state or country relies on unreliable wind and solar power, the more often it will experience blackouts. A corollary: the more voters elect politicians who focus on rare fish and climate cataclysms, the more they will be affected by blackouts.

On April 16, Spain briefly generated 100 percent of its electricity from wind, solar and hydropower. Twelve days later, a massive blackout sent Spain, Portugal and parts of France and Belgium into chaos. Airports canceled flights; lights, computers, televisions, refrigerators, cell phones, traffic lights, trains, subways and elevators stopped working.

All it took was a sudden midday loss of 60 percent of Spain’s electricity needs caused by problems in large solar installations. It triggered “a cascading failure across the entire grid.” Other generating units automatically shut down for safety or to protect the grid and other infrastructure. If nuclear-powered France hadn’t closed its connection to Spain, most of Europe could have shut down.

A week later, another blackout hit Spain’s Canary Islands.

In the United States, a sudden power outage disrupted Memorial Day weekend celebrations for families across southeastern Louisiana as power demand surged during the hottest part of the day. The blackout resulted from a “load shed” order from the regional grid reliability authority, which told utility companies to cut off electricity to customers “to prevent a more extensive, prolonged power outage that could severely affect the reliability of the power grid.”

As the corollary rule suggests, the load shed was needed — and will likely be necessary many times — because Pelican State politicians pay more attention to fashionable issues than to vital, life-or-death matters.

They provide subsidies, loan guarantees, tax breaks and fast-track permits for wind, solar and battery installations, while shutting down reliable power plants and refusing to build additional ones. Meanwhile, they force families and businesses to convert vehicles, heating systems, stoves, water heaters and lawnmowers from gasoline and natural gas to electricity. They drive up demand while reducing electricity generation and reliability, especially during peak demand periods driven by extreme heat and cold.

Repeated, prolonged and rolling blackouts are the inevitable result.

This is happening nationwide, particularly in states with the most wind and solar electricity. California leads all states in generating solar electricity and is also a significant producer of wind energy. Texas is by far the top wind electricity generator and a major solar electricity producer. Florida is number three for solar but generates no wind power.

In 2022, California also accounted for 24 percent of all U.S. power outages, Texas for 14 percent. Over the last 20 years, Florida has had the most people per capita affected by power outages, primarily due to hurricanes, but lags well behind California, Texas, New York and Michigan in the number of blackouts.

New York’s obsession with climate change has left it open to a self-inflicted blackout disaster. The fundamental problems? Insufficient surplus (margin-of-safety) generation to account for equipment failures, human errors and rising electricity demand for data centers, artificial intelligence and mandated conversions to electricity, plus aging grid infrastructure that cannot cope with sudden surges and plunges in generation by large wind and solar installations and rooftop photovoltaic solar feeding into the grid.

Hacking and terrorism also pose major dangers. One attack on a strategically chosen power plant or transformer could shut down an entire region. And America’s heavy reliance on China for wind turbines and transformers, with backdoor entry ports for “maintenance” and “software updates,” makes the country vulnerable to blackouts lasting days, weeks or months.

Politicians and voters need to get a grip on the grid and on other critical quality-of-life issues and stop obsessing over fashionable, politicized mini-matters.

Solar remains the cheapest and fastest source of electricity for US grids, even as artificial intelligence drives an unexpected surge in power demand, according to an analysis by Lazard Inc.

Deploying utility-scale solar costs around $38 to $78 a megawatt-hour, versus $107 for the most efficient type of natural gas plant, said George Bilicic, global head of power, energy and infrastructure at Lazard. What’s more: solar’s lower price tag excludes tax incentives.

Lazard’s findings come as the Trump Administration renews its assault on renewables in a bid to prop up fossil fuels. Washington is vying to gut clean energy tax subsidies, the Energy Department is rolling back funding for renewable projects and US Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently called intermittent power sources “a parasite on the grid!” Yet the administration’s vow to win the AI race has created an urgent need for low-cost electricity supplies.

Lazard’s analysis shows that adding batteries or even back-up gas generation to solar is still cheaper than building gas peaker plants.

“Renewables have a big part to play,” especially as gas prices and construction costs for fossil-fuel plants climb on the back of market volatility and higher exports, Bilicic said in interview. And although renewables are cheaper than gas without subsidies, cutting those tax credits will nevertheless mean consumer power prices will rise, he added.

He also vowed to phase out Indonesia’s coal plants by 2040.","South-east Asia is rapidly growing as a critical link in global supply chains as manufacturers rush to shift production from China amid an escalating trade war. It is also fast emerging as a focal point for new data centres as demand for AI surges.

Yet, as the economies attract billions of dollars in investments from the energy-consuming industries that are also increasingly demanding greener power, investment into renewables is sorely lacking.

South-east Asia accounts for only 2 per cent of global clean energy spending even though it accounts for 5 per cent of global energy demand, according to the International Energy Agency. For every dollar invested in fossil fuels in the region, about 80 cents go to clean energy — far lower than the global ratio of nearly 2:1 in favour of clean energy, the IEA says.

Indonesia, Vietnam and other countries in the region have set out ambitious climate targets — most want to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 — but there remains a massive investment gap. The region generates nearly three-quarters of its power from fossil fuels, and is still building new coal plants.

The IEA estimates south-east Asia will need to spend $190bn annually by 2030 to meet its climate goals — five times the current level.

The US withdrawal in March from a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), a multilateral climate financing programme that promised $45bn for three countries, has come as a much-needed reminder to south-east Asian countries that they cannot just rely on external financing. Indonesia and Vietnam are major recipients, along with South Africa.

“[JETP and other multilateral programmes] cannot be solely relied upon . . . which is why governments should focus on finding solutions that can catalyse private investments,” says Amy Kong, a researcher at Zero Carbon Analytics. She says multilateral financing, which has played a big role in climate financing in the region, is slowing as President Trump retreats from climate goals and reduces US aid globally, but bilateral public finance could help.

While the JETP and other multilateral agreements remain a viable source of funding, they offer a fraction of the investment needed. Experts say south-east Asian countries should undertake extensive policy reforms to create a conducive environment for investment in renewables.

“The private sector will be the main source of finance. However, they will not go in alone,” says Grant Hauber, strategic energy finance adviser for Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “What they need support for is the government policies and the fiscal environment that is created around those policies.”

Hauber says there is a mismatch between countries’ climate goals and policy frameworks that make renewable investments unviable.

Indonesia, the region’s biggest economy, is a good example. Last November, President Prabowo Subianto said Indonesia would achieve net zero emissions by 2050 — bringing forward an earlier target by 10 years. He also vowed to phase out Indonesia’s coal plants by 2040. The country is one of the world’s largest carbon emitters.

But Indonesia continues to allow new coal plants to be built. It also continues to impose a price ceiling on coal sold to power plants, essentially subsidising the fossil fuel and making it far cheaper than alternatives.

As a result, Indonesia has been one of the laggards in clean energy adoption. Government data shows investment in Indonesia’s renewable energy sector totalled $1.5bn in 2023, and it has stayed around the same level for the past six years.

“Indonesia is not competitive enough compared to the other countries based on the renewables capacity installed and policy developments,” says Shabrina Nadhila, Asia energy analyst at think-tank Ember. “The government needs to level the playing field for gas, coal and renewables.”

Indonesia’s energy minister Bahlil Lahadalia recently said Jakarta would retire coal plants early if it could get below-market loans from donors.

Other developing countries have also called for more concessional finance to speed energy transition. And, in fact, that has been one of the sticking points of the JETP programme.

JETP has been criticised by recipient countries for not offering enough grants or concessional loans, and relying too much on loans at market rates. Only a fraction of the promised funds has been disbursed so far.

However, despite the US withdrawal from the programme, other partner countries have promised to make it work. Germany stepped in immediately as the co-lead in the Indonesian JETP plan — the largest of the three at $20bn.

IEEFA’s Hauber said the US withdrawal could actually help JETP progress as US climate policies have recently prioritised oil and gas drilling, and increasing LNG exports. Its continued involvement may have led to delays, he says. “So if anything, a stumbling block has been removed with the US decision to leave.”

But south-east Asian governments still have to remove policy ambiguity and help the private sector.

Ember’s Shabrina says governments could offer guarantees, de-risking instruments or co-finance early stage projects for newer technologies to help draw private companies. “The bottom line is policy consistency and effective governance are key to building investor confidence,” she says.",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7c20a615-83f4-4421-bfc5-f44d12cf5219.jpg?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1,N,,2025-07-06 20:04:39.445578

Despite recent setbacks in U.S. policy, the global shift towards electric mobility continues to accelerate, promising a significant reduction in oil demand.

While the U.S. government delivered a perceived victory to the fossil fuel industry by dismantling clean energy incentives, the long-term impact on the EV market remains optimistic. According to BloombergNEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook 2025, EVs are already displacing millions of barrels of oil daily, and this trend is projected to intensify.

Even with a potential slowdown in U.S. EV sales due to policy changes, the global transition towards cleaner energy is unstoppable. Europe and China are leading the charge in EV adoption, leaving the U.S. to play catch-up.

The Numbers Speak Volumes

The impact of EVs on oil consumption is already substantial. In 2018, early EV adoption displaced one million barrels of road fuel per day. By 2024, that figure doubled to two million barrels – equivalent to the daily oil consumption of South Korea.

Projections indicate that by the end of the decade, EVs will displace over five million barrels of road fuel per day. This decline in oil demand has major oil producers strategizing for a future dominated by electric vehicles.

Big Oil’s EV Pivot

Recognizing the inevitable shift, major oil companies are making significant investments in the EV sector. Chevron is acquiring land for lithium extraction, a critical component in EV batteries. BP is investing heavily in charging infrastructure, partnering with companies like Tesla and Alpitronic. Shell Recharge is expanding its global network of charging stations, including a massive facility in Shenzhen with 258 fast-charging stalls.

The message is clear: Big Oil is preparing for a future where EVs play a central role. Even without U.S. leadership, the global momentum towards electric vehicles is set to continue, disrupting the petroleum industry and paving the way for a cleaner, more sustainable transportation landscape.

Here's what you should know.

Solar & Clean Energy Credits Analysis

The biggest takeaway from this sector is the sooner-than-expected sunsetting of solar and clean energy tax credits. A full breakdown of our analysis can be found here, but a quick synopsis is below.

Solar and Wind Projects Face a Tighter Timeline: To qualify for tax credits, construction must start within a year of the bill’s passage and projects must be operational by the end of 2027—a major shift from prior deadlines.

Watch Out for Foreign Ties: Using equipment or funding linked to certain foreign entities could disqualify your project from receiving tax credits. The guidelines are still evolving, so careful sourcing and documentation are essential.

You Can Still Transfer Credits—With Caveats: The ability to sell or transfer tax credits remains intact, but transfers to prohibited foreign entities are off the table.

Home and EV Tax Breaks Ending Sooner: The popular residential solar and electric vehicle credits will also sunset earlier than expected—by late 2025—so planning ahead is key.

Compliance Just Got More Complicated: With longer audit windows and stricter penalties, it’s more important than ever to review documentation and update contracts to reflect the new legal landscape.

Business Taxation Analysis

From expanded incentives for community development and housing to new limitations on executive compensation and increased IRS enforcement, the bill touches nearly every corner of the business world. Below are some of the most impactful provisions, and you can read our full analysis here.

Opportunity Zones and Community Investment Incentives Expanded: The OBBB makes Opportunity Zones and New Markets Tax Credits permanent, in addition to enhanced benefits for rural areas—offering long-term tax planning opportunities for investors and developers in underserved communities.

Stronger Support for Housing and Construction Projects: Low-Income Housing Tax Credit limits are raised, and more residential construction projects qualify for favorable tax treatment—encouraging developers to revisit financing strategies.

Business Deductions Made Permanent and More Generous: The bill restores 100% bonus depreciation, makes the 20% Qualified Business Income deduction permanent, and reinstates more favorable interest deduction rules—providing valuable relief for both large and small businesses.

Greater Scrutiny for Executive Compensation and Nonprofits: New rules tighten deductions for executive pay over $1 million and expand excise taxes on nonprofit compensation and university endowments—requiring careful review of high-compensation arrangements and endowment funding.

Increased Compliance Burdens and IRS Enforcement Powers: With tighter limits on charitable deductions, permanent excess business loss rules, and expanded enforcement of COVID-relief penalties, businesses should expect greater IRS scrutiny and take steps now to manage compliance risk.

Estate Planning and Medicare Analysis

Changes in estate tax law, Medicaid policy, and long-term care funding make it critical to revisit and revise trusts, gifting strategies, and business succession plans. Here’s more of what you should know.

Estate and Gift Tax Exemption Increased: Beginning in 2026, the estate and gift tax exemption rises to $15 million for individuals and $30 million for married couples, permanently extending the higher thresholds first set by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Clients are encouraged to act quickly to take advantage of the exemption increases before potential future rollbacks by Congress.

Medicaid and Long-Term Care Eligibility Tightened: The OBBB imposes stricter scrutiny, new home equity limits, and more frequent eligibility checks—adding compliance burdens for those relying on public benefits.

Elimination of Reimbursements for Nonresidents: States will no longer receive federal reimbursements for providing medical assistance to nonresidents or individuals not lawfully in the U.S. after September 30, 2025.

Conclusion

The One Big Beautiful Bill represents a seismic shift in federal tax and entitlement policy, with far-reaching consequences for individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations.

“Today, Donald Trump signed into law the worst job-killing bill in American history.
Upon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as “very popular,” though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed his package of tax breaks and spending cuts into law Friday in front of Fourth of July picnickers after his cajoling produced almost unanimous Republican support in Congress for the domestic priority that could cement his second-term legacy.

Flanked by Republican legislators and members of his Cabinet, Trump signed the multitrillion-dollar legislation at a desk on the White House driveway, then banged down a gavel gifted to him by House Speaker Mike Johnson that was used during the bill’s final passage Thursday.

Against odds that at times seemed improbable, Trump achieved his goal of celebrating a historic — and divisive — legislative victory in time for the nation’s birthday, which also was his self-imposed deadline for Congress to send the legislation to his desk. Fighter jets and stealth bombers streaked through the sky over the annual White House Fourth of July picnic.

“America’s winning, winning, winning like never before,” Trump said, noting last month’s bombing campaign against Iran’s nuclear program, which he said the flyover was meant to honor. “Promises made, promises kept, and we’ve kept them.”

The White House was hung with red, white and blue bunting for the Independence Day festivities. The U.S. Marine Band played patriotic marches — and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. There were three separate flyovers.

Trump spoke for a relatively brief 22 minutes before signing the bill, but was clearly energized as the legislation’s passage topped a recent winning streak for his administration. That included the Iran campaign and a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulingshe’s fought for.

After dark, chants of “USA, USA” rose from the picnic crowd on the South Lawn when Trump and the first lady, Melania, appeared on the Truman Balcony to watch the fireworks. They danced to “Y.M.C.A.” and waved goodbye to the crowd before they left for their home in New Jersey.

The budget legislation is the president’s highest-profile win yet. It includes key campaign pledges like no tax on tips or Social Security income. Trump, who spent an unusual amount of time thanking individual Republican lawmakers who shepherded the measure through Congress, contended “our country is going to be a rocket ship, economically,” because of the legislation.

Big cuts to Medicaid and food stamps

Critics assailed the package as a giveaway to the rich that will rob millions more lower-income people of their health insurance, food assistance and financial stability.

“Today, Donald Trump signed into law the worst job-killing bill in American history. It will rip health care from 17 million workers to pay for massive tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations, amounting to the country’s largest money grab from the working class to the ultra-rich,” AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement. “Every member of Congress who voted for this devastating bill picked the pockets of working people to hand billionaires a $5 trillion gift.”

The legislation extends Trump’s 2017 multitrillion-dollar tax cuts and cuts Medicaid and food stamps by $1.2 trillion. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement. Congress’ nonpartisan scorekeeper projects that nearly 12 million more people will lose health insurance under the law.

The legislation passed the House on a largely party-line vote Thursday, culminating a monthslong push by the GOP to cram most of its legislative priorities into a single budget bill that could be enacted without Senate Democrats being able to block it indefinitely by filibustering.

It passed by a single vote in the Senate, where North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis announced he would not run for reelection after incurring Trump’s wrath in opposing it. Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote.

In the House, where two Republicans voted against it, one, conservative maverick Tom Massie of Kentucky, has also become a target of Trump’s well-funded political operation. No Democrats voted for the bill.

The legislation amounts to a repudiation of the agendas of the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, in rolling back Obama’s Medicaid expansion under his signature health law and Biden’s tax credits for renewable energy.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.

Democrats vow to make bill a midterm issue

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin on Friday called the bill “devastating” and said in a statement that Trump’s signature on the legislation “sealed the fate of the Republican Party, cementing them as the party for billionaires and special interests — not working families.”

He predicted Republicans would lose their majority in Congress over it. “This was a full betrayal of the American people,” Martin said.

Trump complained Friday about Democrats opposing the bill, “and we knew that because their hatred of either the country or me or both is so great they didn’t vote at all and it’s terrible.”

He said their “standard line” is to say Republican legislation is “dangerous” or “everybody’s going to die” and “we can’t let them get away with it.” With his bill, Trump said, “it’s actually just the opposite, everybody’s going to live.”

“And I just want you to know, if you see anything negative put out by Democrats, it’s all a con job,” Trump said, defending a package that now is law.

Speaking in Iowa on Thursday night, Trump said Democrats “hate Trump — but I hate them, too.”

The package is certain to be a flashpoint in next year’s midterm elections, and Democrats are making ambitious plans for rallies, voter registration drives, attack ads, bus tours and even a multiday vigil, all intended to highlight the most controversial elements.

Upon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as “very popular,” though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best.

For example, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that majorities of U.S. adults support increasing the annual child tax credit and eliminating taxes on earnings from tips, and about half support work requirements for some adults who receive Medicaid.

But the poll found majorities oppose reducing federal funding for food assistance to low-income families and spending about $45 billion to build and maintain migrant detention centers. About 60% said it was “unacceptable” that the bill is expected to increase the $36 trillion U.S. debt by more than $3 trillion over the next decade.",https://aldailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/AP25185785792402.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 20:05:08.712278

Five of those suspended employees were in the EPA’s Region 1 office in Boston, which oversees all of New England.
“And specifically, they would be looking to see if I used agency time or resources to sign the letter.
It also included some former and current EPA employees who chose to sign anonymously.
“Hopefully, we’ll ultimately win at the end of the day, because, you know, we think [signing the letter] is completely appropriate,” Kipka said.","Last Thursday afternoon, as the work week was winding down before the July 4th holiday, 139 employees of the Environmental Protection Agency received an unwelcome email. They were being put on administrative leave with pay for the next two weeks, pending the outcome of an investigation.

Five of those suspended employees were in the EPA’s Region 1 office in Boston, which oversees all of New England.

Their alleged offense was a decision to sign their names to a letter of protest to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, expressing their “dissent against the current administration’s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise.”

EPA employees who signed the letter say they knew the Trump administration was unlikely to welcome constructive criticism, but news of their suspension still came as a shock.

“I then received a call a little bit later from a representative in HR basically saying that they were investigating the circumstances surrounding my signature on a petition,” one EPA employee in the Boston office told GBH News on the condition that they not be identified. “And specifically, they would be looking to see if I used agency time or resources to sign the letter. I asked the HR rep if I didn’t use agency time and resources, would that mean I would be fine? They said that they could not answer that.”

In all, 620 people signed the letter, including some who had already taken buyout offers and others who were already on administrative leave because their work focused on environmental justice-related projects that the administration has put on hold. It also included some former and current EPA employees who chose to sign anonymously.

“I chose to use my name for that because it’s something I believed in and I do want to look back at this time and be able to say that I stood up for something,” the Boston-office employee told GBH News. “I took this job for a reason. I want to protect the environment, protect public health, and I don’t think that that’s necessarily happening right now with the rhetoric coming from the current administration. So I chose to sign it.”

A spokesperson for the EPA responded to an inquiry from GBH News with a written statement.

“The Environmental Protection Agency has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November,” the statement said, in its entirety.

The agency did not place union representatives who signed the letter on administrative leave.

“Our union is working with our allies to ensure that if discipline comes out of this ... at the end of this investigation period, that we are able to fully represent everyone who spoke out and allow them to exercise their rights to due process,” said Undine Kipka, a union steward of AFGE Local 3428 who signed the letter and also works in the Boston office.

“Hopefully, we’ll ultimately win at the end of the day, because, you know, we think [signing the letter] is completely appropriate,” Kipka said. “And we’re standing up for the mission of the agency, as opposed to diminishing it. We’re standing up for the public, instead of hiding truths from them.”

The letter details “five primary concerns”, including the assertions that misinformation from EPA’s leadership has undermined public trust in the agency, that EPA is ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters, and that environmental progress has been reversed in the most vulnerable communities.

“Given the mission of our agency and our responsibility to the public in swearing an oath to the Constitution as public servants, we felt that characterizing, for example, coal as a fuel source, as 'beautiful and clean,' was essentially contradicting our mission at the agency, in the sense that this is a fuel source that is known to emit more pollutants than other types of fuels and causes harm to public health,” Kipka said. “It’s switching back to a dirtier fuel source that emits more greenhouse gasses when it’s burned. That contradicts the idea that we as a country need to take climate change and action towards mitigating the effects of climate change and really addressing it seriously as a crisis.”

Any retaliatory action against employees could amount to a violation of their First Amendment rights, said David Cash, who served as EPA Region 1 Administrator in the Biden administration.

“They have every right to talk about all range of things when they’re outside of their duties, which is what this was,” Cash said. “This letter was written outside their scope of duties. And this is yet another example of this administration adding layers of autocratic actions on to the everyday business that they’re doing.”

Many of those who signed the letter have served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, Cash said.

“But we’ve seen a level of lawlessness and abandonment of core principles of the EPA, like a diminishment of its science capacity and rolling back whole swaths of regulations, and freezing funds that were duly allocated and obligated by Congress,” he said. “And I think these staff members were quite brave to put their names and their careers on the line to protest this abandonment of a long-standing, decades-long bipartisan protection of human health and the environment.”

Part of the beauty of this country, Cash said, is that dissent is tolerated.

“Not only is it tolerated, it should be part and parcel with how we do our business,” he said. “And so this flies in the face of long-standing philosophy of what makes this country great … Administrator Zeldin has every right to not agree with what these staff members are raising, but retaliation against them goes against their First Amendment rights.”

The EPA employee who spoke with GBH News on the condition of anonymity said if what HR told them about the limited scope of the investigation is true, there shouldn’t be any retaliation.

Even so, they said they’re nervous.

“I mean, this administration hasn’t been known to do things by the book,” the employee said. “So anything is possible. I definitely recognize that, and I am worried about it, but I wouldn’t change what I did. And we’ll face what comes, and I’ll keep fighting for what I think is right, regardless of what happens.”",https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/dims4/default/face9f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+3/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-gbh.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2Fe7%2F12b638504bc391cb4d7d559d8594%2Fimg-1918.png,N,,2025-07-06 23:04:20.511658

This story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The US Environmental Protection Agency placed 139 employees on administrative leave Thursday, an agency spokesperson confirmed, after they signed a “Stand Up for Science” petition using their official titles and EPA positions.

The affected employees received an email, shared with Inside Climate News, informing them that they are on leave through July 17, pending an investigation into whether they used work time or resources when signing the petition.

The email emphasizes that “this is not a disciplinary action.”

One employee, who asked not to be named, said they signed the petition “on a Sunday on my own device.”

“I’d be shocked if anyone used work resources,” the employee went on. “We’ve taken ethics training and are aware of the law.”

While the employees are on leave, they are prohibited from using government equipment, including cell phones, logging into government-issued computers, contacting any EPA employees for access to information, and performing any official EPA duties.

An EPA spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency “has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November.”

The EPA also alleged that the petition contains misleading information, but did not specify what is incorrect.

The petition, addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and members of Congress, is a “declaration of dissent” with the administration’s policies, “including those that undermine the EPA’s mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

“Since the Agency’s founding in 1970, EPA has accomplished this mission by leveraging science, funding, and expert staff in service to the American people,” the petition reads. “Today, we stand together in dissent against the current administration’s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise.”

More than 200 EPA employees, including retirees, signed the petition, some of them only by initials. The document criticizes the agency for “undermining the public trust” by issuing misleading statements in press releases, such as referring to EPA grants as “green slush funds” and praising “clean coal as beautiful.”

The petition also accuses the administration of “ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters,” most notably regarding asbestos, mercury, and greenhouse gases.

Health-based regulatory standards are being repealed or reconsidered, including drinking water limits for four PFAS “forever chemicals” that cause cancer.

“The decisions of the current administration frequently contradict the peer-reviewed research and recommendations of Agency experts. Such contradiction undermines the EPA’s reputation as a trusted scientific authority. Make no mistake: your actions endanger public health and erode scientific progress—not only in America—but around the world.”

Signatories also lambasted the EPA for reversing progress on environmental justice, including the cancellation of billions of grant dollars to underserved communities and the removal of EJScreen, a mapping analysis tool that allowed the public to see pollution sources, neighborhood demographics, and health data.

The petition also opposes the dismantling of the Office of Research and Development, whose work forms the scientific basis for federal rulemaking.

Nicole Cantello is president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Union Local 704, and leader of AFGE Council 238, a nationwide union that represents over 8,000 EPA employees.

She said the EPA’s allegations are baseless.

“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like,” Cantello said. “Now the Trump administration is retaliating against them.”

Cantello said the union will fight for the employees on several legal grounds, including First Amendment protections and employment contractual rights. “We’ll be using all of them to defend our people,” she said.

Matthew Tejada, the former director of the EPA’s environmental justice program and currently senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the Trump administration for going after the EPA employees who signed the letter.

These civil servants, he said, were “totally within their rights” to speak out. “This is a public declaration by those employees that they continue to fight to do their jobs to help people across this country live healthier, safer, more prosperous lives,” Tejada said.

Tejada emphasized that the individuals involved were not working in coordination with advocacy groups, but acting independently in defense of the agency’s mission and the public interest.

He called the administration’s reaction “another indication that this administration is unique in modern times for having zero regard for the Constitution, for protecting and supporting the people of the United States.”

“We are in completely unprecedented waters here,” Tejada said.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/07-06-25ClimateDeskPost.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-06 20:04:44.152700

Green patches are more than just visual relief from concrete-they are vital for a sustainable and healthy future.","Rabinder Shekhar

In a rapidly urbanizing world, the value of green patches-whether parks, gardens, forests, or small vegetated areas or roads-has never been more significant. These patches of greenery, often overlooked amid skyscrapers and infrastructure, play a crucial role in maintaining environmental balance, enhancing public health, and improving the overall quality of life. They are the real engines of healthy environment. We go out for a walk but in absence of these, our all walk is futile. Nature has done a wonderful work by blessing the plants to produce oxygen and take away waste carbon dioxide from human beings and give us the life. The green patches have a number of benefits which we all know but what we do with these flora and fauna, is a suicidal act. I count a few of the benefits of green vegetation hereunder: –

Environmental Benefits: Green patches act as the lungs of cities and rural areas alike. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, improving air quality and mitigating the effects of pollution. Trees and plants in these areas also reduce urban heat island effects by cooling surrounding areas through shade and evapotranspiration.

Moreover, green patches aid in biodiversity conservation by providing habitats for birds, insects, and other wildlife. Even small pockets of greenery can become vital refuges for native species, especially in heavily built-up environments.

Green spaces help in reducing air pollution: By absorbing the harmful gases, plants are then able to release oxygen into the atmosphere. Producing oxygen helps to combat the harmful effects of air pollution. By having green spaces in urbanized areas, plants and greenery are providing us with higher-quality air. The vegetation in green spaces has the effect of purifying air, and the vegetation generally reduces PM10,2.5 in three ways: deposition, retention, and adsorption. Studies have shown that trees in urban areas can reduce air PM10 concentration by 0.2-1.0% annually.

Water Management and Soil Protection: Vegetated areas help in managing storm water runoff. By allowing rainwater to infiltrate the ground, they reduce the burden on drainage systems and help recharge groundwater tables. The roots of plants also bind the soil, preventing erosion and maintaining land fertility.

Health and Well-being: Numerous studies have shown that exposure to green spaces reduces stress, enhances mood, and promotes physical activity. Parks and community gardens provide spaces for exercise, recreation, and social interaction-essential components of mental and physical health.Access to green patches has also been linked with lower rates of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as improved cognitive development in children.

Aesthetic and Economic Value: Green spaces enhance the beauty of any landscape. They increase the aesthetic appeal of neighborhoods and can even raise property values. In commercial areas, well-maintained green patches attract more visitors and encourage longer stays, boosting local economies.

Climate Resilience: As the climate crisis intensifies, green patches serve as buffers against extreme weather. They provide shade during heatwaves, reduce flood risk during heavy rainfall, and help sequester carbon. Their role in making cities more resilient to climate change is both immediate and long-term.

Keeping us calm: Some scientists and researchers also believe that because our eyes are at the peak of their perception to detect the wavelengths corresponding with the color green, the shade may calm us down. With less strain to perceive the colors, our nervous system can relax when perceiving the tone.

This sedative quality of green may explain why there is so much of it in hospitals, schools and work environments. Historically, actors and actresses would recess to green rooms after so much time looking into bright lights on stage, though modern “green rooms” are rarely painted green.

After the eight-year study was completed, the data revealed that participants who lived in the greenest areas had a 12% lower death rate than women living in the least green areas. With more green space, study authors said, came more opportunity to socialize outdoors. Additionally, the natural settings – compared with residential regions where plants and greenery were sparse – proved to be beneficial to mental health.

“We were surprised at the magnitude of the mental health pathway,” said Peter James, study author and research associate at the Harvard Chan School’s Department of Epidemiology. Of those who did not live in greener areas, respiratory issues were the second highest cause of death. The study indicated that less exposure to polluted air may have been one of several reasons for increased life expectancy among those who lived in green areas.

Our ancestors lived their entire lives outdoors. The benefits we stand to gain from adopting an outdoor mindset could have a positive impact. “We know already that vegetation can help mitigate the effect of climate change. Green patches are more than just visual relief from concrete-they are vital for a sustainable and healthy future. Urban planners, governments, and communities must prioritize the preservation and expansion of green spaces. Whether through rooftop gardens, tree-lined streets, or protected natural reserves, every effort counts toward creating a livable planet for future generations. Think, what we are doing today, scrapping all vegetation and green patches in the name of development. Is this sustainable development? is the question. Everywhere huge mega projects of road work and infrastructure is coming up, damaging and removing the green belt. How can we justify all these? The deployment at the risk of human lives cannot be accepted. What is use fun of the development when generations will have to pay with their lives.",https://cdndailyexcelsior.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/naturer.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 20:04:58.195070

As rescue crews continue their frantic search for missing children along the Guadalupe River, experts warn that similar incidents could continue to happen as the federal government slashes funding for weather forecasting, shutters climate websites and databases, lays off scientists and researchers and weakens disaster response capabilities at a moment when climate change is increasing the frequency of such events.

That includes California, where the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its subsidiary, the National Weather Service, are reeling from cutbacks ordered by the Trump administration. In May, at least two California offices of the NWS said they no longer have enough staff to operate overnight: Hanford and Sacramento, which together cover nearly all of the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada mountains, some of the state’s most fire-and-flood-prone areas.

Nationally, more than 600 scientists and meteorologists have already been laid off or taken a buyout from NOAA this year. The Trump administration is planning to cut thousands more employees next year — approximately 17% of its workforce — and slash the agency’s budget by more than $1.5 billion, according to the fiscal 2026 budget request. The president has said the changes will help reduce federal waste and save taxpayers money.

Yet these and other changes come as human-caused climate change contributes to larger and more frequent floods, wildfires and hurricanes, among other worsening disasters. The Texas flood, in particular, was marked by the type of extremely intense, highly localized downpour that is becoming much more common due to global warming. Portions of the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in less than an hour, state officials said.

“This is one of the hardest things to predict that’s becoming worse faster than almost anything else in a warming climate, and it’s at a moment where we’re defunding the ability of meteorologists and emergency managers to coordinate,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources. “That trifecta seems like a recipe for disaster.”

Indeed, just how frequently such events occur will soon become harder to tell, as the Trump administration has already eliminated NOAA’s database for tracking billion-dollar disasters. Its last update before the shutdown confirmed that there were 27 weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion each in the United States in 2024. In the 1980s, the nation averaged just 3.3 such events per year, adjusted for inflation, the database shows.

The administration last week shut down the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s website, which housed congressionally mandated reports and research on climate change. Meanwhile, the weather service has begun halting weather balloon operations at multiple locations due to staffing shortages, reducing the amount of data that’s available.

Details about the Texas incident are still unfolding. Some state officials were quick to point the finger at the National Weather Service — including Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd, who said forecasts did not adequately predict the amount of rain that fell on the area.

Agency officials said they did their job — issuing multiple warnings in advance of the incident, including some that advised of potentially catastrophic conditions. A timeline provided to The Times by the National Weather Service indicated that an expanded flood hazard outlook was issued on the morning of July 3, and that multiple, increasingly urgent alerts followed.

“The National Weather Service is heartbroken by the tragic loss of life in Kerr County,” agency spokesperson Erica Grow Cei said in an email, adding that the NWS “remains committed to our mission to serve the American public through our forecasts and decision support services.”

However, the local area office was also short several key positions, including a senior hydrologist, staff forecaster and meteorologist in charge, the New York Times reported Sunday. Also absent was the office’s warning coordination meteorologist — the person who acts as the liaison between the weather service and the public and emergency management officials — who took Trump’s buyout earlier this year.

On Sunday, Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro called for an investigation into whether staffing shortages at the agency played a role, telling CNN’s “State of the Union” that “not having enough personnel is never helpful.”

In a statement, the White House did not address staff reductions but said no funding cuts have yet occurred at the National Weather Service.

“The timely and accurate forecasts and alerts for Texas this weekend prove that the NWS remains fully capable of carrying out its critical mission,” a spokesperson from the U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees NOAA, said in an email.

While the precise circumstances that surrounded the Texas tragedy will continue to be studied in the days and weeks ahead, experts say it is clear that such climate hazards will continue to happen.

“With a warmer atmosphere, there is no doubt that we have seen an increase in the frequency and the magnitude of flash flooding events globally,” said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist with AccuWeather.

Porter credited the weather service with issuing warnings in advance of the flash flood, but said there was a breakdown when it came to local officials’ response to the information.

“The key question is, what did people do with those warnings that were timely, that were issued?” Porter said. “What was their reaction, what was their weather safety plan, and then what actions did they take to based upon those timely warnings, in order to ensure that people’s lives were saved?”

Yet even efforts to enhance coordination between the weather service, the government and the general public could soon be on the chopping block. NOAA has been researching better ways to communicate disaster warnings, including improved public education and early warning systems, at its Oceanic and Atmospheric Research division, which is facing a hefty 74% budget cut if not complete elimination.

The president’s proposed 2026 budget would also reduce funding for specialized, high-resolution thunderstorm models that have been developed for just this type of event, according to Swain of UC ANR. He noted that it’s an area of research that was pioneered by the U.S. government, in large part because the country has some of the most extreme thunderstorm weather in the world.

“Nearly all of the research in the world, historically, toward understanding these types of storms and predicting them has been sponsored by the U.S. federal government, and nearly all the advances we have made have been U.S. taxpayer-dollar funded,” Swain said. “Other countries aren’t going to do that on behalf of the U.S. ... So if we don’t do it for ourselves, we aren’t going to have access to that.”

The Texas flood “is representative of precisely the kind of nightmare scenario that is going to become more likely with the further extreme cuts that are proposed, and likely to be implemented to some degree,” he added.

Notably, the changes at NOAA and the NWS are meeting with other new priorities from the president, including a renewed investment in oil and gas drilling — fossil fuel industries that are among the top contributors to global warming.

In southeastern states such as Florida, officials are also grappling with reduced hurricane forecasting capabilities at the height of hurricane season.

And in California, where multiple wildfires are currently burning, state officials are also facing reduced firefighting capabilities as Trump deploys National Guard firefighting troops in Los Angeles and reduced forest management and firefighting staffing at the U.S. Forest Service.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f009154/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7743x4065+0+548/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2Fab%2F0890b477424ba1ace523bee577ab%2Fap25187625454653.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 20:05:11.589457

It turns out that Donald J Trump — despite taking us on a tour of the rosebushes of the White House before coming across a Tesla, being handed a script, and selling us all electric vehicles — doesn’t actually care about them, the environment, technology, or Elon Musk.

The President of the United States took us through the prices and horsepower of various Tesler models in — believe it or not — a disingenuous sales pitch for his ex-best-friend-forever, Mr Musk.

Now, the so-called Big Beautiful Bill — his new bestie — has been passed, cutting tax incentives for potential EV buyers and putting the United States behind in the race to dominate the market.

Despite the fact that buyers have until September 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on electric vehicles before they are sent into the void, expert advice asks a simple question: What’s the point anymore?

Before the bill came into being, new EVs came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000, effectively bridging the gap between electric and petrol. They are cheaper to run than gas-powered cars, but the initial price hike was a turn-off for many.

Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more appealing to prospective buyers simply by making them more affordable; at present, to buy a new electric vehicle it is around $9,000 more expensive than a gas guzzler, or $2,000 if you’re buying used.

However, it’s not all doom and gloom. Electric vehicles are the investors’ choice, as in the long run they are significantly more efficient to drive compared to their coal-powered ancestors. “Quickly you’ll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,” Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America told CBS.

Critics of federal EV charging infrastructure funding say that it took too long for states to act on the federal opportunity.
Actually, the time delay in EV charging infrastructure rests in designs and approvals to be finalized.
Reports of recent EV charging mishaps are highly exaggerated.
But we in the EV world have high expectations for EV charging as the future becomes now.","The convenience of home charging is an enormous benefit to battery-electric vehicle drivers. Of course, most of us who own an electric vehicle also drive far from home, and that’s where EV charging has proven to be a bit tricky and occasionally downright frustrating in past years.

Let’s be honest. Unless you had a Tesla and could tap into the Supercharger network, you’d expect broken chargers. Weird adapters required. Cars parked in the rare EV charging space for hours — and hours and hours. Oversized e-trucks blocking other charger space access. Locating a charger behind a car dealership, only to find it disabled.

But that was then; this is now. In the first three months of 2025, overall failure rates fell to 16%, the biggest improvement since the surveys began in 2021, according to JD Power. This summer, more EV drivers than ever will be able to charge without mishap on their lovely scenic road trips.

Could the days of fear of EV charging (FOEVC) be behind us?

Did you know there were about 55,200 fast chargers in the US in May, up from 42,200 just a year earlier? Those numbers come from the Alternative Fuels Data Center. These EV charging ports are designed to minimize downtime and maximize efficiency, allowing vehicles to quickly complete one task and move on to the next without significant delays.

The North American Charging Standard, developed by Tesla, now offers a further advantage of slimmer, lighter handles that are easier to plug into cars. Automakers are updating their cars so ports fit a lot more EV charging infrastructure; that allows drivers to recharge more quickly and get back on the road. And EV charging companies are building new stations.

In 2024, more than 1.3 million public charging points were added around the globe, representing an increase of more than 30% compared to the previous year. The charging points added in 2024 alone were approximately equal to the total number of points available in 2020. (It’s important to note that about two-thirds of that growth in public chargers has occurred in China.)

If Charging is Getting Good, Then Why are Fewer Drivers Thinking about EV Adoption?

The June 3 AAA EV survey reported that only 16% of US adults reported being “very likely” or “likely” to purchase a fully electric vehicle (EV) as their next car, the lowest percentage recorded of EV interest since 2019. The percentage of consumers indicated they would be “unlikely” or “very unlikely” to purchase an EV rose from 51% to 63%, the highest since 2022. These low satisfaction rates were despite the wide variety of electric vehicle models now available — over 75 options introduced in the past four years.

However, the primary reasons for buying EVs didn’t change in the AAA survey responses: gas savings, environmental concerns, and an appreciation for the lower maintenance costs associated with EVs.

Despite advancements in the EV industry and the growing availability of models, public perception regarding EV charging remains uncertain. Most people don’t know that they could be saving hundreds of dollars each year by switching to an EV. And why not? The corrupt Trump administration has done all it can to decimate EV expansion and reinvigorate the fossil fuel industry.

The US National EV Infrastructure program, part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was passed in 2021, allocated $5 billion to fund fast chargers along corridors. By the end of 2024 about $30 million had been spent on charging points that are now in operation. Critics of federal EV charging infrastructure funding say that it took too long for states to act on the federal opportunity.

Actually, the time delay in EV charging infrastructure rests in designs and approvals to be finalized. Once contracts are signed by all parties, permits are lined up, and hardware is delivered, construction only takes a couple of weeks. New EV charging facilities can be up and running very quickly once the behind-the-scenes work is done.

Nonetheless, in January 2025, Executive Order 14154 paused the disbursement of funds for a review of the processes, policies, and programs associated with EV charging grant selections, making future disbursements of the remaining unspent funds uncertain. The Big Bad Budget Bill ended up cutting the EV tax credits, with the last day to participate on September 30, 2025.

Electric vehicles continue to sell, regardless of clickbait-inspiring headlines and regressive political leaders. After all, transportation electrification is too important. US drivers indicate that they’ll be purchasing more than 100,000 secondhand EVs in the second quarter, according to preliminary estimates from Cox Automotive. Used EV sales are set to shoot up 27% from the first quarter and surge 45% year-on-year.

Motivations behind EV Adoption and Skepticism

Academics emphasize the importance of identifying motivations in public behavior. Various motivations can influence individual attitudes, such as the need for security, stability, achievement, social status, social justice, and a sense of responsibility for the future. The Trump administration has fed into a narrative in which to belong means to adhere to MAGA values.

Men, particularly, seem to be susceptible to the confluence of Trump condemnation of EVs and traditional masculine identity. Negative male attitudes toward EVs and reluctance to purchase EVs are consistent with masculinity contingency, which is a measure designed to assess the extent that a man’s self-worth is derived from his sense of masculinity. Less favorable attitudes about EVs, lower intention to purchase EVs, and higher likelihood of rating EVs as the least-preferred new vehicle purchase option seem connected to identity self-reflection.

Yes, misinformation and disinformation has blurred what could have been an exponential rise in EV adoption, but, as our CleanTechnica colleague Jake Richardson explains, electric vehicles are too “critical for human health and the environment to be shut down.” Scientific evidence, reasoning, logic, and facts point to the long-term adoption of EVs and an eventual ubiquitous EV charging infrastructure.

Final Thoughts about EV Charging

The turbulence in Washington reinforces the value of Generation180’s ​“I’ll Drive What She’s Driving” campaign. Policy can be very fragile, but trusted messengers and the clean energy constituencies that the non-profit is building is intended to have real staying power — regardless of who’s in power in Washington.

EVs have the lowest fuel cost of any vehicle type, based on a national average electricity price of 15.9 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). EVs also have the lowest maintenance costs among all models. Wondering which US state offers the best EV charging? It’s Massachusetts, with the most charging ports and EV stations.

Reports of recent EV charging mishaps are highly exaggerated. Yes, dealers have yet to create their lots as welcoming spaces for charging. Sure, it could mean that only their customers may have permission to charge, but other businesses have created incentives that cultivate their customer base in similar ways. But we in the EV world have high expectations for EV charging as the future becomes now.

It would help a lot of people if the media would take time to chronicle people like me and you who love their EVs and who find EV charging to be generally smooth and carefree.

Some of the governor’s biggest new plans to control state spending will need buy-in from the Legislature.
That’s what we’re focused on delivering.” The fiscal 2026 budget increases state spending just shy of 5.4% over the spending bill Healey signed last summer.
Healey vetoed a combined $130 million from 28 line items, less than the $248 million net spending she struck from last year’s budget and the $205 million net spending she eliminated the year before.
The conference committee budget settled on $20 million, and then Healey vetoed it down to $10 million.","BOSTON (SHNS) – On the same day President Donald Trump signed a landmark domestic policy bill that will reshape state finances for years to come, Gov. Maura Healey approved a $60.9 billion annual budget and rolled out a companion proposal designed to empower her administration with greater cost-cutting power.

Healey on Friday signed the fiscal year 2026 budget lawmakers sent her on Monday, in the process vetoing $130 million in planned spending amid crystallizing concerns that federal funding to Massachusetts will drop and the state may face new costs in a world where the so-called “big, beautiful bill” is the law of the land.

Between her spending cuts and changes that legislative negotiators made to cushion against financial strain, the final budget that became law — which is packed with big funding boosts for health care, education and transportation plus policy measures like a limit on renter-paid broker fees — raises spending by more than 5% but is more than $1 billion smaller than the version Healey filed in January, before the federal bill emerged.

The governor and her deputies will pursue other steps to further buttress against budgetary impacts from economic downturn or federal funding cuts, especially to the massive and costly Medicaid insurance program.

Officials announced Friday that an executive branch hiring freeze implemented in May will remain in effect for the duration of fiscal year 2026, which runs through next June. The administration will also scrap a 2% raise for thousands of executive branch managers set to start in January, which officials said would save $17 million.

While Healey did not veto any of the earmarks lawmakers wrote into the budget to support projects and programs in their districts, the administration will delay paying about $125 million of those until at least the fall. Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz said if the state is in a precarious fiscal position at that point, everything will be on the table, including cancellation of earmarks.

Some of the governor’s biggest new plans to control state spending will need buy-in from the Legislature.

Healey on Friday filed a new $130 million supplemental budget bill that her office said would create a $100 million “flexible pool of resources” that the administration could tap later in the year to deal with “changing economic conditions and federal spending decisions.” The other $30 million would go toward a housing preservation and stabilization fund, which Gorzkowicz said would provide resources to housing programs amid concerns about safety-net impacts from new federal policy.

That bill would also grant the administration the ability to transfer some line-item spending between agencies and use capital dollars instead of operating dollars to pay for some Department of Transportation workers. The governor is also asking for new authority that might prove unpalatable to some lawmakers: a limited-time ability to cut spending unilaterally from the entire state budget.

The existing state law limits a governor’s power to trim spending midway through the year only to the executive branch, which according to Gorzkowicz makes up roughly 55% to 60% of the budget. Other areas like quasi-public agencies, local aid, retirement and other post-employment benefits, and debt service cannot be targeted by what are commonly known as “9C cuts.”

Gorzkowicz said the new supplemental budget would, only in fiscal year 2026, allow the administration to trim from anywhere if revenue collections fall at least $400 million below projected benchmarks or if federal policy changes cost the state budget $400 million or more.

Officials are still sifting through the federal megabill, which the U.S. House approved Thursday and Trump plans to sign Friday, to determine its full impacts on state budgeting. Gorzkowicz said he hopes to have a better understanding in roughly a month.

A preliminary estimate from health policy nonprofit KFF suggested the Medicaid changes could cost Massachusetts $15 billion to $25 billion over the next decade.

Another outside section to Healey’s new bill would grant the state Department of Public Health the ability to set the schedule for childhood vaccines instead of relying on recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — a panel that U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy completely reshaped last month.

The timing of Healey’s budget signature is unusual in two ways: she announced the action on a federal holiday that created a long weekend, and she acted more quickly on an annual budget than any Massachusetts governor in at least 25 years.

For every other annual budget since fiscal 2001, at least seven days elapsed between the final Senate enactment vote and the governor’s response, according to data tracked by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.

Gorzkowicz said the administration wanted to move rapidly on the budget because lawmakers sent it to Healey before the July 1 start of the fiscal year for the first time since 2016.

In another unusual move, Healey does not plan any press conference to discuss her budget actions. The only public event on her schedule Friday is attending the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on the Charles River Esplanade in the evening.

“I’m proud to sign a budget that is fiscally responsible and protects what makes Massachusetts special,” Healey said in a statement. “I’m grateful to the Legislature for their strong partnership and efficient work to develop and pass this budget for the people we serve. In Massachusetts, we are continuing to lead and do what we know works – focusing on lowering costs, protecting essential care and services, and moving our economy forward by investing in housing, transportation and our schools.”

“We are also signing this budget in a moment of great dysfunction in Washington,” she added. “The President is poised to sign a bill that’s going to kick hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents off their health care, increase energy and groceries prices, and cost people their jobs.”

In a social media post the day before she announced her action on the budget, Healey touted her approach to state spending as a contrast with the incoming federal law.

“We want you to have access to health care, to education, transportation,” Healey said. “I want you to be able to afford groceries, housing, heat and electricity. That’s what we’re focused on delivering.”

The fiscal 2026 budget increases state spending just shy of 5.4% over the spending bill Healey signed last summer. Some of that increase is driven by the use of $2.4 billion in revenue from the voter-approved surtax on high earners, which will fund major investments in K-12 schools, early education and care grants, operating support for the MBTA and regional transit authorities.

Healey vetoed a combined $130 million from 28 line items, less than the $248 million net spending she struck from last year’s budget and the $205 million net spending she eliminated the year before.

A $27.5 million reduction this time around pairs with a directive Healey issued to the Group Insurance Commission to eliminate coverage of GLP-1 weight loss drugs for state employees unless medically necessary. Officials said that change would more closely match private health insurance, where several plans have called out the increasingly popular drugs as major cost drivers.

Healey also cut $10 million from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, according to Sen. Michael Barrett, the Senate’s point person for energy and climate policy and the chairman whose committee is reviewing Healey’s energy affordability legislation.

The governor originally proposed a $30 million outlay for MassCEC. The conference committee budget settled on $20 million, and then Healey vetoed it down to $10 million.

Barrett said the additional change hinders clean tech at a time when it is talked about as a cornerstone of the state’s economy for decades to come and threatens the state’s readiness for a post-Trump era.

“I don’t quite see how it all computes and I’m astounded. I feel that Massachusetts is sending a very weird signal out into the world,” Barrett said. “We’re not going to see any clean energy progress on the federal front and now we’re doing something that would have the effect of doubling the federal assault.”

An official said Friday afternoon that the administration will use $10 million from an Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs trust fund to bring MassCEC funding to a combined $20 million after the veto.

Lawmakers have the power to override any of the governor’s vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.

Healey also returned two outside sections of the budget with amendments, one seeking a technical change and the other proposed to study, not implement, a mandatory retirement savings program for employees who lack access to such programs through their workplaces.

That Secure Choice Savings Program had drawn criticism from the National Federation of Independent Business both when the House quietly added it via amendment and when the provision survived conference committee negotiations.

In a letter to lawmakers alongside her amendment, Healey said she believes “further consideration of the proposal is warranted.”

“Saving for retirement is an important goal, but there are many ways to encourage this behavior. This proposal has invited feedback from various groups who, while supportive of the goal of expanding access to retirement saving, suggest there are additional implementation questions that need to be resolved prior to enactment,” Healey wrote. “These implementation questions should be answered before we establish a new statewide program and obligation on Massachusetts employers.”

Legislative negotiators built some flexibility into the final state budget bill they shipped Healey, aiming to strike a balance between Democrats’ appetite for significant spending on state services and the prospect of federal funding cuts.

They trimmed the bottom line hundreds of millions of dollars below the original House- and Senate-approved versions, incorporated nearly half a billion extra surtax dollars, and left about $800 million in anticipated revenues unappropriated as a cushion against future impacts.

House budget chief Aaron Michlewitz called the legislative budget “not only [a bill] that will allow our economy to grow, but will also do this while maintaining the Legislature’s commitment to fiscal stability [and] sustainability.”

“Some have said that this piece of legislation is actually the real ‘big, beautiful bill’ being taken up this week,” Michlewitz said Monday while introducing the accord. “Unlike the one in Washington, this piece of legislation is one that will not hurt our residents, but will help improve the lives of all our constituents, not just the ones with the largest paychecks.”

Gorzkowicz said the administration has spoken with budget chiefs in the House and Senate about convening a hearing in the fall with economists to examine the state’s financial footing and whether officials need to revise their tax collection estimates for fiscal 2026.

The secretary by law must certify by Oct. 15 that the state has sufficient revenues to fulfill expenditures, and he said that deadline will be a key early milestone.

Healey’s office provided written quotes about the budget from House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka thanking the governor for her signature.

“This FY26 budget makes key investments that better support Massachusetts students and families, that increase access to affordable health care, and that provide for a safer and more reliable public transportation system – all without raising taxes,” Mariano said. “In a moment of incredible uncertainty at the federal level, this budget is proof that government can be both fiscally responsible and an agent of good, the kind of government that our residents deserve.”

Added Spilka, “In Massachusetts, we know that the best investment we can make is in our people, and this budget reflects the Senate’s continuing commitment to do so while maintaining our equal commitment to responsible money management. This statewide approach to investment delivers resources to every part of the state and protects our most vulnerable residents from the cruelest actions of the federal government, while our continued focus on education and mental health ensures that people have they keys to unlock the doors of opportunity.”",https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/07/statehousenews-45.png?w=1280,N,,2025-07-06 19:05:16.423927

Slate Price Slated Now for Mid $20,000’s

Slate Auto’s minimalist electric pickup which many considered would be the only American-made EV priced “under \$20,000 will now cost buyers in the “mid-twenties.” The sharp price increase is triggered by the repeal of federal EV tax credits.

The price hike follows the passage of former President Donald Trump’s new energy bill, which eliminates the \$7,500 federal incentive for electric vehicles starting September 30, 2025.

Originally a key marketing hook for the Indiana-built truck—known for its stripped-down design without paint, stereo, or touchscreen—the low price was only achievable with the credit factored in.

The startup, backed by Jeff Bezos, updated its website just days ago, replacing its bold price promise with more tempered language.

Nexperia 1st ESD Diodes for 48V Automotive Data

Nexperia introduced the first electrostatic discharge (ESD) diodes specifically designed to protect 48V automotive data communication networks, addressing a critical gap in protection for evolving EV and HEV architectures. The new portfolio includes six AEC-Q101 qualified diodes with reverse working voltages of 54V, 60V, and 72V, providing robust ESD protection while maintaining signal integrity at higher data rates. Housed in compact SOT23 packages and offering ultra-low capacitance (as low as 3.4 pF), these components help designers save PCB space and costs. Previously, manufacturers resorted to complex workarounds for ESD protection on 48V lines, but this new solution enables streamlined, high-performance protection for legacy protocols like CAN, CAN-FD, LIN, and FlexRay in modern EVs and HEVs.

In Race for EV Adoption, China Leads

As battery electric vehicles (BEVs) reach a plateau of technological parity around the world, the factors driving their success are shifting from engineering feats to policy frameworks, infrastructure availability, and brand trust. That’s the key takeaway from the 2025 E-Mobility Attractiveness Index, released jointly by consulting firm BearingPoint and the Handelsblatt Research Institute.

For the first time, the index compares the four most significant BEV markets — China, the United States, Germany, and France — combining objective data and consumer surveys to assess how attractive each country is for EV adoption.

China Sets the Pace

With a leading score of 133.5 (baseline 100), China topped the index, driven by state-backed industrial policy, low-cost electricity, and a dense network of charging stations. The United States followed with 114.4, ahead of Germany (108.4) and France (94.6).

According to Sven Jung, Director of Economic Analysis at the Handelsblatt Research Institute, China’s lead is rooted in “years of strategic government support, protection of domestic players, and a coordinated approach to infrastructure and innovation.” Still, Jung cautions, the lead is “not insurmountable” if other nations act decisively.

Charging Is the New Battleground

With technical differences in range, consumption, and charging speeds narrowing across global EV models, infrastructure — not hardware — now defines everyday usability. China and Germany have built out robust public charging networks that extend into rural areas, while the U.S. and France continue to struggle with gaps, especially in regions lacking private charging access.

“To move e-mobility from niche to mainstream, drivers must be able to forget where the chargers are,” said Jung. “And when they do need one, it should be fast enough not to interrupt their day.”

Policy: The Hidden Hand Behind Price

While cost remains a major barrier to BEV adoption, the report underscores how much of that cost is policy-driven. Chinese consumers benefit from generous subsidies and low-cost energy. In Germany, the removal of purchase incentives and high electricity rates have made BEVs less appealing.

European policymakers, the study notes, have an opportunity to reclaim momentum by reinstating targeted incentives, regulating electricity prices for EV owners, and accelerating investment in local battery and semiconductor production.

“Getting to mass adoption isn’t about just building better cars,” said Manuel Schuler, BearingPoint’s Global Leader for Automotive and Industrial Manufacturing. “It’s about governments creating an ecosystem where price, infrastructure, and power all align.”

Trust: The Intangible Advantage

Though often overlooked, consumer trust — especially brand loyalty — emerged as a critical differentiator. In each country, local brands scored highest: BYD in China, Renault in France, Volkswagen in Germany, and Tesla in the U.S. Yet these same brands often struggle abroad, particularly Chinese automakers, who face persistent skepticism in European markets despite competitive products.

BYD earned the highest brand-specific score in the index at 155.9, yet Schuler notes that without a stronger presence and clearer brand identity overseas, Chinese OEMs may continue to fall short of their global ambitions.

“They have the tech,” he said. “But winning hearts and wallets abroad requires more than just specs — it takes commitment, pricing, and a locally attuned brand strategy.”

About the Index

Originally launched in Germany in 2024, the E-Mobility Attractiveness Index evaluates how appealing BEVs are to consumers in terms of infrastructure, affordability, policy incentives, and brand trust. The 2025 edition is the first to expand internationally.

Federal incentives that saved U.S. electric vehicle buyers up to $7,500 are officially gone. Republicans recently pushed through legislation that eliminates these key EV credits from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, significantly changing the landscape for prospective EV shoppers.

Impact on EV Adoption Rates

Scrapping these incentives creates a definite slowdown—but not a total halt—in electric vehicle adoption. According to BloombergNEF, the U.S. will fall behind global EV trends, dropping out of the top three electric car markets worldwide. Without incentives, forecasts project U.S. electric vehicle market share at just 27% by 2030—down significantly from the previously estimated 48%.

However, experts like Elaine Buckberg from Harvard’s Salata Institute believe the impact might not be as severe as some expect. Even without federal credits, Buckberg predicts EV sales will still make up about 37% of new car purchases by 2030.

Prices Falling, Options Rising

Despite losing tax incentives, EVs remain attractive due to increasing affordability and model variety. The average EV price in the U.S. dropped from $64,700 to $59,900 since January 2023, according to Edmunds. Additionally, the EV market now offers double the models available two years ago, with more affordable options below the average vehicle price of $47,500.

Many dealerships also offer generous discounts. Stephanie Valdez Streaty from Cox Automotive highlights significant deals, such as Nissan Leaf prices dropping below $20,000 through dealer incentives alone.

Challenges for Lower-Income Buyers

While higher-income buyers might shrug off incentive removals, lower-income Americans are feeling the pinch. Ingrid Malmgren, policy director at Plug In America, emphasizes these policy shifts disproportionately impact less wealthy buyers who need incentives most.

The administration’s broader policy changes—including halting a $5 billion EV charging infrastructure project and easing emissions standards—compound these difficulties, further curbing EV growth in lower-income communities.

Global Momentum Continues

Outside the U.S., EV markets keep accelerating, especially in China. Cheaper batteries and a flood of affordable Chinese EV models sustain rapid global growth, with one-quarter of all new global car sales projected to be electric in 2025.

(TSX:NYSE: ; NYSE:ENB), a leading North American energy infrastructure company, finds itself at a critical juncture as it navigates a complex landscape of regulatory challenges, market volatility, and evolving energy demands. With a market capitalization of $97.59 billion and a notably low beta of 0.86, Enbridge demonstrates relative stability compared to broader market movements. According to InvestingPro data, the company’s stock generally trades with low price volatility, making it an interesting consideration for investors seeking stability in the energy sector.

Company Overview

Enbridge operates primarily in the North American Midstream and Refining sector, with its core business segments focusing on Liquids Pipelines and Gas Transmission and Midstream. The company’s vast network of pipelines and energy infrastructure plays a crucial role in North America’s energy ecosystem, transporting and distributing oil, , and renewable energy across the continent.

Financial Performance

Enbridge has demonstrated remarkable consistency in its financial performance, with analysts noting the company’s confidence in achieving its financial guidance for the 20th consecutive year. This track record underscores the company’s resilience and ability to navigate challenging market conditions. InvestingPro data reveals an impressive 22-year streak of dividend raises, with a current dividend yield of 6.03%. The company has maintained dividend payments for 53 consecutive years, demonstrating exceptional commitment to shareholder returns.

Earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Enbridge reflect a positive trajectory. For the fiscal year 2025 (FY1), analysts project an EPS of CAD 2.95, with an increase to CAD 3.25 for fiscal year 2026 (FY2). These projections suggest steady growth in the company’s profitability, despite the various headwinds it faces.

Growth Strategy

Enbridge’s growth strategy centers on its core segments of Liquids Pipelines and Gas Transmission and Midstream. The company has been actively investing in its diversified asset base, with a particular focus on natural gas-related projects. This strategic direction aligns with the increasing power demand observed in the market and positions Enbridge to capitalize on the growing need for clean energy solutions.

Analysts view this diversification positively, noting that it could lead to increased revenue streams in the future. The company’s ability to adapt to changing energy landscapes while maintaining its core strengths in traditional oil and gas infrastructure demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to long-term sustainability.

Regulatory Environment

The regulatory landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for Enbridge. Recent developments in utility rate cases have raised concerns among analysts about the growth prospects for the company’s US gas utilities. A less favorable outcome than expected in an Ohio utility rate case has prompted analysts to closely monitor upcoming rate cases in Utah and North Carolina, which could significantly impact Enbridge’s future earnings growth.

On a broader scale, the potential for permitting reform and policy changes in Canada following the federal election could have substantial implications for Enbridge’s operations. While the exact nature of these changes remains uncertain, they represent a key factor in the company’s future regulatory environment.

Market Position

Enbridge’s strong market position is evident in its significant market capitalization and its critical role in North American energy infrastructure. The company’s ability to potentially mitigate the impact of tariffs on refiners with coastal assets, such as Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE: ), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: ), and Phillips 66 (NYSE: ), demonstrates its strategic importance in the energy value chain.

Despite recent market volatility and a sell-off in the stock market, some analysts believe that these short-term fluctuations do not accurately reflect Enbridge’s long-term fundamental momentum. The company’s diversified asset base and strategic positioning in key energy corridors continue to provide a solid foundation for its market presence.

Future Outlook

Looking ahead, Enbridge faces a complex set of challenges and opportunities. The company’s reaffirmation of its guidance despite macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical volatility speaks to its confidence in its business model and strategic direction. Recent financial metrics from InvestingPro show strong revenue growth of 43% over the last twelve months, though the stock is currently trading above its Fair Value estimate. These external factors remain significant considerations for the company’s future performance. Want deeper insights? InvestingPro offers exclusive access to over 10 additional ProTips and comprehensive valuation metrics for Enbridge, helping investors make more informed decisions.

The increasing focus on natural gas projects aligns well with the growing demand for cleaner energy sources. As power demand continues to rise, Enbridge’s investments in this area could prove particularly valuable. Additionally, the potential for favorable outcomes in future rate cases and beneficial policy changes in Canada could provide tailwinds for the company’s growth trajectory.

Bear Case

How might unfavorable rate case outcomes impact Enbridge’s growth?

The recent downside surprise in the Ohio utility rate case has raised concerns about Enbridge’s growth prospects, particularly for its recently acquired US gas utilities. If this trend continues with upcoming rate cases in Utah and North Carolina, it could significantly hamper the company’s ability to achieve projected earnings growth. Unfavorable outcomes may limit Enbridge’s capacity to invest in infrastructure improvements or expand its operations, potentially leading to reduced competitiveness in key markets.

What risks does macroeconomic uncertainty pose to Enbridge’s operations?

Ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical volatility present substantial risks to Enbridge’s operations. These factors can lead to fluctuations in energy demand, commodity prices, and exchange rates, all of which directly impact Enbridge’s revenue streams and profitability. Moreover, economic downturns could result in reduced industrial activity and energy consumption, potentially affecting the utilization rates of Enbridge’s infrastructure assets and putting pressure on its financial performance.

Bull Case

How could Enbridge’s diversified asset base drive future growth?

Enbridge’s strategic focus on diversifying its asset base, particularly in natural gas-related projects, positions the company well for future growth. As global energy markets increasingly prioritize cleaner fuel sources, Enbridge’s investments in natural gas infrastructure could capture a growing share of the energy market. This diversification not only helps mitigate risks associated with any single energy sector but also allows Enbridge to capitalize on emerging opportunities across the energy spectrum, from traditional oil and gas to renewable energy solutions.

What potential benefits could arise from Canadian policy changes?

The upcoming Canadian federal election could lead to policy changes that benefit Enbridge’s operations. Potential permitting reforms or energy-friendly policies could streamline project approvals, reduce regulatory burdens, and create a more favorable environment for infrastructure development. Such changes could accelerate Enbridge’s growth plans, enhance its competitive position, and potentially open up new markets or expansion opportunities within Canada. Additionally, supportive policies could attract more investment into the Canadian energy sector, indirectly benefiting Enbridge through increased demand for its infrastructure services.

The sedan will be available in a number of trim levels, including the performance flagship i3 M60 xDrive, as well as the i3 20, i3 40, i3 40 xDrive, i3 50, and i3 50 xDrive.
All of this suggests that BMW might just be gearing up to capture a sizable portion of the premium electric sedan market, potentially coming for the Tesla Model 3.
Out of all the trims, it is the i3 M60 xDrive, which is expected to go toe to toe with the Tesla Model 3 Performance.
Based on current i3 models, I can see the i3 being priced competitively in the premium sedan segment, likely starting around US$50,000 based on current i3 models.","BMW is working on introducing a new 3 Series that will include a standalone electric vehicle called the i3, alongside the standard ICE and plug-in hybrid models. And unlike the oddball carbon-fiber hatchback that was once known by that name, the next-generation electric i3 is set to be an out-and-out sedan.

It will be built on the long-awaited Neue Klasse dedicated EV platform, and is slated to go into production at the automaker's Munich facility in July 2026, paving the way for an early 2027 debut.

The 2027 BMW i3, code-named NA0, will be built with the company's latest motor and battery technology. The sedan will be available in a number of trim levels, including the performance flagship i3 M60 xDrive, as well as the i3 20, i3 40, i3 40 xDrive, i3 50, and i3 50 xDrive. All of this suggests that BMW might just be gearing up to capture a sizable portion of the premium electric sedan market, potentially coming for the Tesla Model 3.

This information comes from the highly reliable Bimmerpost forum, and interestingly, the production schedules, along with anticipated grades and options for the i3 and iM3, tie in with what BMW has previously revealed.

Out of all the trims, it is the i3 M60 xDrive, which is expected to go toe to toe with the Tesla Model 3 Performance. It will likely produce up to 630 horsepower, significantly more than the 510 horsepower of the Model 3 Performance, but like the Tesla model, the new vehicle will feature dual-motor all-wheel-drive systems. Targeting Tesla's rear-wheel-drive and Long Range all-wheel-drive models, lower trims like the i3 40 and i3 50 will likely be better suited for more efficient daily driving.

Speaking of which, out goes the Gen5 tech stack, with BMW's Gen6 battery likely coming in on the sedan, providing higher efficiency and power density. It makes use of cylindrical cells, surpassing the existing Gen5 pouch cells in energy density by 20%, increasing range by 25% while lowering weight and cooling requirements. With a range of 560 miles (900 km) according to the WLTP cycle, the i3 50 will likely outperform the 360-mile (580-km) WLTP range of the Tesla Model 3 Long Range.

In contrast, Tesla employs a combination of NCA/NMC (for Performance and Long Range) and LFP (for base models) battery chemistries. Although Tesla's efficiency in the real world is still remarkable, BMW's Gen6 packs look like they could be the benchmark for premium EVs in 2027.

As for charging up, you'd be able to add up to 217 miles (350 km) of WLTP range in just 10 minutes thanks to support for 300–400-kW DC fast charging. Compare that to the Tesla Model 3, which, under ideal circumstances, can juice up by about 175 miles (280 km) in a 15-minute stop, owing to a maximum capacity of 250 kW on its network of Superchargers. Now that is a big, big difference.

Compatibility with Tesla's Supercharger-Netz is more or less guaranteed by BMW's adoption of the North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector for its Neue Klasse cars, including the i3. This levels the playing field, giving EV users more freedom and access to more than 12,000 Supercharger stations nationwide in addition to other public charging choices.

Now, most importantly, what’s it going to cost? Based on current i3 models, I can see the i3 being priced competitively in the premium sedan segment, likely starting around US$50,000 based on current i3 models. That’s just me speculating though. But if that happens to be the case, it might draw Tesla customers looking for German engineering and a longer range. The appeal of EVs may further increase with regulatory developments that encourage their adoption, such as $7,500 in US tax credits.

But that's not to say BMW is in the clear. There's still a lot of work to be done. The standard set by Tesla's software ecosystem, which includes autonomous driving capabilities and over-the-air updates, is bar none. BMW would need to provide a well-designed user interface and cutting-edge driver-assistance technologies to compete. And of course, the car has to be priced right too.",https://assets.newatlas.com/dims4/default/04478d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1504x790+0+107/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc4%2F0a%2F9ce59e1a4dcaadf6eff232b1ac2f%2Fbmw-neue-klasse-new-clarity-elec.jpg&na.image_optimisation=0,N,,2025-07-06 19:05:10.818902

ABS has developed advanced simulation modeling of thermal runaway in lithium-ion battery fires, in a critical step forward in tackling one of maritime’s biggest emerging safety risks — car carrier fires involving EVs .

The cutting-edge model, which has now been validated with Texas A&M University research, replicates the thermal runaway profile at the battery cell level, unlocking detailed insight into the total heat released and guiding the appropriate firefighting response.

It is the latest development in ABS’s efforts to address the significant safety challenge presented by transporting electric vehicles at sea.

“Runaway electric vehicle fires can reach temperatures of 1,200°F (650°C) or higher and present unprecedented safety challenges to the shipping industry, which connects manufactured vehicles to global market,” says ABS chairman and CEO Christopher J. Wiernicki. “ABS is at the forefront of the industry’s response to this, which requires a blend of advanced technology, Safety excellence and shipping insight. Developing the ability to accurately predict the behavior of these fires is a perfect example of this and will be a foundation of the ultimate solution.

ABS offers both an enhanced fire protection notation EFP-C(EV) in the ABS Marine Vessel Rules, which provides criteria for additional fire protection arrangements in RO/RO cargo spaces intended to carry electric vehicles as well as the Best Practices for the Transport of Electric Vehicles Advisory which includes additional advice. ABS is also funding advanced research with partners around the world, including at the Laboratory for Ocean Innovation, at Texas A&M University, where battery fire prevention and response is one of eight research priorities.

The group, based out of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said Ottawa should retool its EV mandate by revisiting its near-term targets to help the auto sector “weather this temporary storm” of slumping EV sales.

“Any additional flexibility added in the regulation should be designed to achieve other EV-related goals, such as delivering more affordable EVs and building out Canada’s charging network,” says the statement by executive director Rachel Doran and director of public affairs Joanna Kyriazis.

The plea comes on the heels of auto manufacturing leaders meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney last week, in which the CEOs repeated their calls for the mandate to be repealed.

Starting next year, the mandate would require 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada to be zero-emission vehicles. Those also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The target rises annually to 100 per cent by 2035.

Recent data from Statistics Canada suggests EVs accounted for 7.53 per cent of all new vehicles sold in April.

Following the meeting, the head of an organization representing Ford Canada, GM Canada and Stellantis said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" the government would take action on the mandate.

Clean Energy Canada also called on Ottawa to re-fund the EV incentive program, but to be clearer as to when the program will be phased out.

The government launched the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program in 2019, which gave car buyers up to $5,000 toward the cost of an electric vehicle. The program was abruptly suspended back in January when its funding ran out.

It has left many dealerships on the hook for the rebate if they hadn't already sent in their claim before the program ended. The federal government put nearly $3 billion into the program during its lifespan.

""The rebate should start at $5,000 and decline by $1,000 each year, providing consumers and automakers with a well-communicated phaseout that avoids periods of artificially lowered EV sales as buyers await the return of rebates or at least clarity,"" Clean Energy Canada says.

A similar policy is in place in Quebec.

Federal ministers have said in recent months that the government was working toward bringing back consumer incentives on EVs.

Those promises faced criticism from automakers themselves because, without implementing a rebate, EV sales are slumping further, as buyers wait for the rebates to come back.

Clean Energy Canada also called on the federal government to reconsider its approach to cheaper EVs from China, which are subject to a 100 per cent tariff which took effect in October. Ottawa is scheduled to review the measure later this year.

""Allowing in a limited quota of these affordable vehicles while also recognizing EU-approved vehicles … would open Canada’s vehicle market to fill important market gaps, drive innovation and ultimately make our auto sector more competitive,"" the group says.

The first is that oil companies may lack the sector-specific experience required in order to succeed with wind and solar projects.
For instance, on a particularly windy day, the wind energy produced will outstrip demand, which drives down prices.
In HVDC systems, resistor technology plays a vital safety role by dissipating excess wind energy during faults, helping to stabilise the grid and prevent damage.
Ultimately, privately owned oil and gas companies are more likely to be driven by shareholder interests than they are by environmental targets.","Oil and gas giant BP recently walked back the net-zero targets it introduced in 2020, saying the company had moved 'too far, too fast’. The announcement is part of a worrying trend of energy providers and other multinationals reducing or watering down their sustainability strategies. Here, Mike Torbitt, managing director of resistor manufacturer Cressall, explores the causes behind this movement and explains the role that resistor technology can play in meeting sustainability targets.

In February 2025, BP announced plans to cut its budget for renewable projects by $5 billion, while simultaneously increasing its investment in fossil fuels to $10 billion per year.

The decision will see the oil giant produce 2.4 million barrels of oil per day by 2030. Given that just 36 fossil fuel companies are responsible for over half of the planet’s emissions, this step backwards has a hugely damaging potential.

But BP is not the only energy provider to backtrack on its sustainability commitments. The move comes a year after fellow oil giant Shell dialled back its 2030 target to cut net carbon intensity from 2016 levels, lowering its goal from 20 per cent to a range of 15 to 20 per cent. But why are energy providers turning their backs on these objectives?

Profit versus planet

Currently, renewable energy projects such as wind and solar are simply not returning as much profit for oil and gas companies as fossil fuels. According to 2023 figures from NPR, US companies producing oil and gas could expect to make a return of between 20 and 50 per cent return on investment on the capital invested into projects. For solar and wind projects, the estimated figure stands at just five to ten per cent.

Consequently, there is less investor interest in the stocks of oil companies that are diverting their budgets towards wind and solar. Take for example the five-year period between the end of 2019 and the end of 2024. New York Times data shows that BP’s stock prices fell by 19 per cent and Shell’s grew by around 15 per cent. Meanwhile, the stock price of competitor Exxon Mobil, which did not invest in wind and solar energy, grew by over 70 per cent.

There are a few major barriers to profitability. The first is that oil companies may lack the sector-specific experience required in order to succeed with wind and solar projects.

Exxon Mobil instead chose to invest in hydrogen and lithium extraction, since the skills needed are very similar to those used in extracting oil. While the mining of these elements comes with its own environmental concerns, both are vital components in the production of battery-powered vehicles.

A second factor affecting profitability is the high initial investment costs for renewable projects combined with the low prices of solar and wind power. This means that it takes years, or even decades, for investors to see return on investment.

Improving infrastructure

While these energy sources have become less expensive to generate in recent years, they tend to produce energy during the same time periods. For instance, on a particularly windy day, the wind energy produced will outstrip demand, which drives down prices. Additionally, wind turbines are increasingly being turned off as the grid is unable to cope with this surplus.

One solution to this issue is using interconnectors, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cables that connect the energy grids of different countries, enabling the movement of renewable energy to international markets where demand is higher. HVDC technology is ideal for long-distance transmission with minimal energy losses.

In HVDC systems, resistor technology plays a vital safety role by dissipating excess wind energy during faults, helping to stabilise the grid and prevent damage. DC neutral earthing resistors also add a further layer of protection to HVDC converter transformers, both offshore and onshore, by managing fault currents and ensuring system reliability.

Ultimately, privately owned oil and gas companies are more likely to be driven by shareholder interests than they are by environmental targets. However, by ensuring that the correct infrastructure is in place to make the most from the renewable resources, it’s possible to improve both sustainability and profitability.",https://www.altenergymag.com/images/facebooknews.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 19:05:23.789584

This dominance—driven by low costs, state subsidies, and strategic control of critical minerals—poses both opportunities and risks for U.S. automakers and investors. As the U.S. accelerates its EV transition, the race to secure supply chains and technological parity is intensifying.

China's Unrivaled Scale and Control

China's EV battery giants, CATL (37.9% global market share) and BYD (17.2%), are not just manufacturers but gatekeepers to the world's fastest-growing industry. In May 2025, China produced 123.5 GWh of power batteries, a 47.9% year-on-year surge, with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries—preferred for cost efficiency—accounting for 81.6% of installations. CATL's market share in LFP batteries alone hit 36.05%, underscoring its entrenched position.

The U.S., by contrast, produces only 70 GWh of EV batteries annually against a domestic demand of 99 GWh, relying on imports for ~30% of needs—primarily from China. Even U.S. automakers like Tesla and Ford depend on Chinese-made components, as CATL supplies 70% of global EV battery cells. This dependency is compounded by China's near-total control of critical minerals: 100% of spherical graphite processing, 69% of synthetic graphite, and significant stakes in lithium and nickel supply chains.

The U.S. Response: Ambition vs. Realities

The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocated $210 billion to EV production, targeting $100/kWh battery costs by 2030. U.S. battery capacity is projected to nearly double to 421.5 GWh by 2025, with projects like LG Energy Solution and Honda's $4.4 billion Ohio plant (40 GWh capacity) and Toyota's $14 billion North Carolina facility (5,000 jobs).

However, the path is fraught with risks:

1. Policy Uncertainty: A potential Trump administration could roll back IRA tax credits, which currently provide up to $7,500 per EV and $35 billion for battery manufacturing.

2. Cost Disadvantages: U.S. battery production costs remain 20% higher than China's, exacerbated by tariffs on imported components.

3. Supply Chain Gaps: The U.S. lacks domestic refining capacity for lithium and cobalt, relying on Chinese or Australian suppliers.

Investment Opportunities: Where to Play

U.S. Battery Makers: Companies like Tesla (partnering with CATL and Panasonic) and Ford (linked to SK On) benefit from IRA subsidies. However, their stock performance will hinge on reducing supply chain risks.

Critical Minerals: Lithium miners such as Albemarle (ALB) and Livent (LVNT) are positioned to profit from rising demand. Investors should also watch graphite plays like Sayona Mining (SYM.AX), as synthetic graphite demand soars.

Recycling Tech: Companies like Redwood Materials and Li-Cycle could capitalize on China's dominance of battery recycling, which controls 60% of the global market.

Diversification Plays: Firms like Northvolt (Europe's only viable competitor to CATL) and Panasonic (PCRFY), partnering with Tesla, offer exposure to non-Chinese supply chains.

Risks to Avoid

Overexposure to China: Automakers reliant on Chinese batteries or minerals, such as those without U.S.-based gigafactories, face heightened geopolitical and regulatory risks.

Policy Volatility: U.S. firms lacking IRA compliance (e.g., using “Foreign Entity of Concern” suppliers) may lose subsidies.

Cost Inflation: Rising labor and energy costs in the U.S. could erode margins for manufacturers unable to match China's scale.

Strategic Recommendations

Overweight: U.S. battery producers (TSLA, F) and critical mineral stocks (ALB, LVNT) with IRA benefits.

Underweight: Automakers without domestic supply chains (e.g., GM's reliance on South Korea's LG) and speculative lithium miners.

Consider ETFs: The Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) or ARKQ (autonomous tech) offer diversified exposure.

Conclusion

China's EV dominance is a fact of global commerce, but the U.S. has tools to mitigate risks: refining trade data, boosting domestic production, and diversifying supply chains. Investors must balance exposure to China's scale with bets on U.S. firms capable of competing on cost and innovation. The next three years will determine whether the U.S. can forge an independent supply chain—or remain tethered to a rival's battery factories.",,N,,2025-07-06 17:05:11.537871

Tesla’s credit revenue highlights the complexities of transitioning to EVs.","Tesla’s dominance in electric vehicle (EV) production is poised to yield significant profits from Canada’s new zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates, fueling tensions with traditional automakers. According to a recent analysis, Tesla earned $2.8 billion globally in 2024 from selling compliance credits, a figure that accounted for 40% of its profit. As Canada tightens ZEV regulations, Tesla’s credit revenue is expected to grow, raising concerns about market fairness and local economic impacts.

Canada’s ZEV Mandate Drives Credit Demand

Starting in 2026, Canada will require 20% of light-duty vehicle sales to be zero-emission, escalating to 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035, reports Automotive News. Automakers failing to meet these targets must purchase credits from competitors like Tesla or face fines of $20,000 per non-compliant vehicle.

Tesla, producing only EVs, generates surplus credits, already selling nearly 32,000 in Quebec alone to brands like BMW and Toyota between 2020 and 2024. With national regulations looming, demand for Tesla’s credits is expected to surge, potentially increasing their value.

Economic and Competitive Implications

The credit system creates a financial advantage for Tesla, which reported $2.8 billion in global credit revenue in 2024, equivalent to roughly 3.7 billion CAD at current exchange rates. For traditional automakers, buying credits is often the only viable path to compliance.

“It’s really the only option” for many, said David Adams, CEO of the Global Automakers of Canada reportedly, highlighting the lack of scalable EV production among import brands.

However, this reliance increases costs, which may be passed to consumers, potentially raising vehicle prices.

Critics argue the policy disproportionately benefits Tesla, a company with no Canadian assembly plants. Brian Kingston, CEO of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, called it “nonsensical” to funnel profits to Tesla, which employs fewer Canadians than legacy automakers. Kingston also criticized Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s “directly hostile” stance toward Canada, referencing Musk’s support for U.S. rhetoric about annexing Canada.

Policy Contradictions and Local Backlash

Canada’s ZEV mandate contrasts with other policies targeting Tesla. In March 2025, Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland announced Tesla’s ineligibility for federal EV incentives until U.S. tariffs, deemed “illegitimate and illegal,” are lifted. Provincial rebate programs also excluded Tesla this spring amid backlash against Musk’s comments. These moves aim to curb Tesla’s financial gains, yet the ZEV credit system inadvertently bolsters its revenue, creating a policy paradox.

Industry and Regulatory Outlook

The ZEV mandate reflects Canada’s push for cleaner transportation, aligning with global trends toward electrification. However, the credit system’s structure raises questions about fairness and long-term impacts on Canada’s auto industry, which employs thousands in manufacturing.

Kingston warned that enriching Tesla undermines local workers and contradicts Ottawa’s resistance to aggressive U.S. trade policies. As automakers invest in EV production—Ford plans a new EV plant in Ontario by 2027—the reliance on credits may wane, but Tesla’s head start ensures it remains a key player.

Tesla’s credit revenue highlights the complexities of transitioning to EVs. While the policy accelerates decarbonization, it sparks debate over economic equity and national priorities. As Canada balances environmental goals with industry concerns, the ZEV mandate’s ripple effects will shape the EV market for years to come.

Invest in the negawatt With so much outside influence on our energy bills, how can we take control?","Dear Eartha, what determines how much we pay for electricity and natural gas in our homes?

Locally and nationally, there’s been a lot of talk about energy affordability lately. But what actually goes into our energy bills, and how much control do we have over what we’re paying? Take a few minutes to study your bill and you’ll realize the answer is more complicated than the kilowatt hours of electricity or therms of natural gas you use.

A closer look at your energy bill

The primary factor influencing your energy bill is, unsurprisingly, energy consumption. You also help to pay for infrastructure upgrades, like new wind farms, transmission lines or pipelines. And, if you’re an Xcel Energy customer like me, you’ll see line items that fund energy efficiency and electrification programs approved by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission . For those curious, these charges are defined on the last page of your bill and on Xcel’s website .

Keep in mind that Xcel Energy is a regulated utility in Colorado. That means the rates and charges we pay have to be approved by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission before any changes can be made to customers’ bills.

Beyond the bill – commodity pricing and federal policy

Another factor influencing your bills is the wholesale cost of fuel and purchased energy . In Xcel’s case, these costs are adjusted quarterly and directly passed onto customers. Even though Xcel does not profit from these charges, they can have a significant impact on our bills. How? Because fuels like natural gas – used for both electricity generation and heating buildings – are subject to variables like weather and market conditions . Remember winter storm Uri ? The February 2021 event had a huge impact on gas prices across the central U.S. and Colorado. Demand for gas spiked, supply dropped and prices increased as a result. In Colorado, the public utilities commission allowed electric and gas utilities to recover these extraordinary costs by adding an additional fee to customer bills for a limited amount of time.

Federal policy can also impact energy costs. Consider some of the changes to tax law just passed by Congress. Tax credits for solar and wind energy projects are being phased out years sooner than anticipated . At the same time, electricity demand is surging across the country . Building any type of new power plant takes time, but solar, wind, and batteries are the fastest to deploy . Burning natural gas for electricity is generally cleaner and more efficient than coal, but manufacturers of natural gas turbines are facing supply-chain backlogs of up to five years . The likely impact of all of this is higher energy bills — if renewable electricity projects cost more to build, then the cost of electricity will be more expensive . And it doesn’t really matter how much natural gas you drill or frack if a lack of turbines means new natural gas power plants are slow to come online — a limited supply of electricity in the face of increasing demand will simply increase costs.

Invest in the negawatt

With so much outside influence on our energy bills, how can we take control? By investing in the cleanest, least expensive form of energy: the negawatt, or the energy we don’t use . Energy efficiency is one of the best ways to hedge against future energy cost increases, because when you use less, you pay less. You’re also likely to make your home more comfortable at the same time.

How to get started? Get a home energy audit . These diagnostic assessments are the best way to figure out where your home is inefficient, so you can follow through on the recommendations and make strategic improvements. Even with federal tax credits for home efficiency projects sunsetting at the end of this year , the High Country Conservation Center offers incentives for energy efficiency and electrification projects. And for a limited time, High Country Conservation Center will cover 100% of eligible project costs up to $5,000 for full-time residents who earn up to 150% of the Area Median Income . Xcel Energy offers a number of rebates , too.

It’s easy to feel powerless in the face of policy and regulatory changes, whether state or federal. But without sacrificing comfort or breaking the bank, you do have the power to use less power.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/2/2019/05/23112649/AskEartha-SDN-112015.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 17:05:22.342929

In a statement published Friday, Clean Energy Canada gave three recommendations to the federal government to help deliver affordable EVs to Canadians for less than $40,000.

The group, based out of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said Ottawa should retool its EV mandate by revisiting its near-term targets to help the auto sector “weather this temporary storm” of slumping EV sales.

“Any additional flexibility added in the regulation should be designed to achieve other EV-related goals, such as delivering more affordable EVs and building out Canada’s charging network,” says the statement by executive director Rachel Doran and director of public affairs Joanna Kyriazis.

The plea comes on the heels of auto manufacturing leaders meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney last week, in which the CEOs repeated their calls for the mandate to be repealed.

Starting next year, the mandate would require 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada to be zero-emission vehicles. Those also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The target rises annually to 100 per cent by 2035.

Recent data from Statistics Canada suggests EVs accounted for 7.53 per cent of all new vehicles sold in April.

Following the meeting, the head of an organization representing Ford Canada, GM Canada and Stellantis said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" the government would take action on the mandate.

Clean Energy Canada also called on Ottawa to re-fund the EV incentive program, but to be clearer as to when the program will be phased out.

The government launched the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program in 2019, which gave car buyers up to $5,000 toward the cost of an electric vehicle. The program was abruptly suspended back in January when its funding ran out.

It has left many dealerships on the hook for the rebate if they hadn't already sent in their claim before the program ended. The federal government put nearly $3 billion into the program during its lifespan.

""The rebate should start at $5,000 and decline by $1,000 each year, providing consumers and automakers with a well-communicated phaseout that avoids periods of artificially lowered EV sales as buyers await the return of rebates or at least clarity,"" Clean Energy Canada says.

A similar policy is in place in Quebec.

Federal ministers have said in recent months that the government was working toward bringing back consumer incentives on EVs.

Those promises faced criticism from automakers themselves because, without implementing a rebate, EV sales are slumping further, as buyers wait for the rebates to come back.

Clean Energy Canada also called on the federal government to reconsider its approach to cheaper EVs from China, which are subject to a 100 per cent tariff which took effect in October. Ottawa is scheduled to review the measure later this year.

""Allowing in a limited quota of these affordable vehicles while also recognizing EU-approved vehicles … would open Canada’s vehicle market to fill important market gaps, drive innovation and ultimately make our auto sector more competitive,"" the group says.

These figures became clear following an investigation spurred by the Senate Budget Committee, which demanded in November 2023 that the largest U.S. insurance companies provide the number of nonrenewals by county and year.
The 2024 weather events included storms, wildfires, droughts, flooding, tornadoes, tropical cyclones and other types of extreme weather.
In addition to considering which areas are “high risk”, insurers also assess the building materials used for construction.
In California, which has strict building codes to mitigate wildfire risk, insurers have been increasingly rejecting requests for coverage.","As countries worldwide experience more regular extreme weather events, insurers have become more reluctant to cover properties in high-risk areas. However, without insurance, it is impossible for many people to gain access to mortgage financing. We are seeing an insurance crisis in the United States, as insurers are becoming less likely to offer coverage for homes in certain areas, particularly those that have experienced natural disasters, such as flooding and wildfire, in recent years.

Between 2018 and December 2024, over 1.9 million home insurance contracts were “nonrenewed”, meaning they came to an end. The nonrenewal rate tripled or more in over 200 U.S. counties, according to a congressional report. These figures became clear following an investigation spurred by the Senate Budget Committee, which demanded in November 2023 that the largest U.S. insurance companies provide the number of nonrenewals by county and year.

Some states and cities are seeing greater nonrenewal rates than others, particularly those at greater risk of fire, flood, hurricanes and other severe weather events. Although there is still a lack of information on the reason behind the nonrenewals, the countrywide map of nonrenewals strongly reflects the climate crisis as it is being seen across the U.S. Some of the areas most affected include California, Florida, and North Carolina.

Following the publication of the report, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said, “The climate crisis that is coming our way is not just about polar bears, and it’s not just about green jobs.” Whitehouse added, “It actually is coming through your mail slot, in the form of insurance cancellations, insurance nonrenewals and dramatic increases in insurance costs.”

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in 2024, there were 27 individual weather and climate disasters, coming only behind the record-setting 28 events in 2023. Last year was the fourth-costliest year on record in terms of these types of events, with a total cost of approximately $182.7 billion, coming after 2017 ($395.9 billion), 2005 ($268.5 billion), and 2022 ($183.6 billion). The 2024 weather events included storms, wildfires, droughts, flooding, tornadoes, tropical cyclones and other types of extreme weather.

In addition to considering which areas are “high risk”, insurers also assess the building materials used for construction. Many mobile or manufactured homes are not covered by insurers. Companies may also impose restrictions on houses constructed out of wood and other fire-prone materials. However, even states with strict building codes are seeing more coverage denials. In California, which has strict building codes to mitigate wildfire risk, insurers have been increasingly rejecting requests for coverage. In certain counties, nonrenewal rates have risen by over 500 percent since 2018.

The government has started to respond to the problem in some areas of the country. For example, in December, officials announced that they would make it easier for insurers to increase rates, but in exchange, they must agree to continue insuring consumers in fire-prone areas. Other state and local governments are carrying out prescribed burns in residential areas, as well as clearing vegetation close to houses, to reduce the risk of wildfire spread in these areas.

Some companies have halted new insurance policies in certain parts of the country, such as AllState. In 2022, AllState paused the sale of new home and condo insurance policies in California. A spokesperson for the firm stated, “Our payments to help California residents recover from accidents and disasters have increased significantly in recent years due to higher repair costs and more frequent and severe weather… We continue to offer coverage to most existing home insurance customers.”

State Farm, one of the biggest insurance providers in the U.S., followed suit in 2023 by halting the sale of new housing insurance products in California. In Florida, by the spring of 2024, at least 12 insurance companieshad stopped selling housing insurance in the state. Farmers Insurance stated upon withdrawing from Florida, “This business decision was necessary to effectively manage risk exposure.”

A 2024 report by the non-profit First Street Foundation, showed that 23.9 million properties in the U.S. were at risk from damaging winds, 4.4 million properties were at risk from wildfire, and a further 12 million properties were at significant risk of flooding – in addition to properties in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema)'s Special Flood Hazard Areas. The report stated, “Private insurance companies are effectively labelling areas as uninsurable.”

The result of the withdrawal of insurance companies from certain parts of the country is the inability for consumers to get a mortgage, meaning fewer people can buy a house. As houses sit empty, it drives down property prices in the area and leads to less tax revenue being collected to invest in services. Many communities are facing these consequences and feel left behind. If the U.S. government does not take action to mitigate the risk of the impact of extreme weather events in these areas or encourage insurers to continue covering high-risk areas, this will happen to a greater number of communities across the country.

State records show that the project would have a devastating impact on air pollution in several North Carolina communities.

What's happening?

Inside Climate News reported that the expansion would increase horsepower at two compressor stations located along the pipeline in the towns of Mooresville and Lexington. The increased throughput would allow more gas to flow through the pipeline, at an environmental cost of releasing more than 935,000 tons of planet-warming pollution annually.

Meanwhile, communities near the pipeline, including those with compressor stations, would be exposed to pollution from hazardous substances such as carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds at concentrations up to 350% higher than current levels.

The 42-inch pipeline isn't just a threat to air quality; it's also a potential danger to life and property in the event of an explosion.

Maps released by Transco that show the proposed route for the pipeline reveal that hundreds of homes, businesses, schools, daycare centers, and recreational areas are located within the pipeline's blast zone — the area around a natural gas pipeline where an explosion could cause serious injury or death due to flying debris, a pressure wave, or incineration.

""This is a serious environmental and public health danger that FERC should consider,"" Erin Sutherland, the policy and program director of the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit environmental watchdog, said in a comment to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Why is the proposed pipeline expansion concerning?

Juhi Modi, North Carolina field coordinator at Appalachian Voices, a grassroots environmental organization, said that residents in Mooresville and Lexington ""are already burdened by decades of air pollution from existing Transco infrastructure and deserve to breathe clean air.""

Data from the Environmental Protection Agency's EJ Screen appears to support these findings, as it indicates that communities located within a one-mile radius of the compressor station in Lexington experience higher-than-average exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5. While the pipeline infrastructure isn't the only contributor to poor air quality, it likely plays a major role.

Compressor stations also release benzene, a known human carcinogen, and both towns already have exceedingly high levels of the chemical. ""In Lexington, benzene exceeds federal hourly emission rates by 100 times; in Mooresville, the figure is 61 times,"" per Inside Climate News.

Consistently poor air quality is linked to a number of health problems, including asthma, lung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, and living near a gas pipeline can worsen these ailments or increase the chance of developing them.

The fact that hundreds of people live near the proposed pipeline expansion, as well as businesses, churches, and schools operating in the area, is also quite concerning. While pipeline explosions are not extremely frequent, the consequences can be severe when they do happen, according to the Houston-based law firm Kherkher Garcia.

And even though explosions are rare, natural gas pipelines have been shown to leak methane — a potent planet-warming gas — at much higher levels than previously thought, even to the point of being detectable from space using satellite technology.

What's being done to protect North Carolina residents?

The Midway Town Council voted to oppose the pipeline project and compressor station in Lexington, which is ten miles away from Midway. Town officials requested that FERC mandate the installation of pollution control technologies at the compressor stations, should the proposal be approved.

Recently, U.S. appeals courts have blocked construction on several gas pipeline projects in New Jersey and Tennessee, indicating that awareness is growing about the environmental and societal harms associated with burning dirty fuels.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Transco-pipelineimage-recyoTX8WuPFH5hC9-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 16:06:16.783049

The Wall Street Journal reported that Volkswagen’s ID.Buzz AV, already navigating Hamburg’s streets in test mode, combines advanced sensor technology with a practical design to reshape urban mobility.

Autonomous Technology in Action

The ID.Buzz AV, developed with Israeli firm Mobileye, boasts a robust sensor suite for Level 4 autonomy, meaning it can drive itself on set routes without human intervention. It features:

13 cameras

9 LiDARs (laser-based sensors for precise mapping)

5 radars

These allow the minivan to handle complex urban environments, though challenges remain. During a Hamburg test ride, the vehicle struggled with delivery trucks blocking its path, once veering into oncoming traffic. “Not the best driving decision,” said Christian Senger, head of autonomous vehicles at Volkswagen, highlighting the need for refinement. Unlike Tesla’s camera-only approach, Volkswagen’s use of LiDAR enhances reliability in adverse conditions like rain or snow, a critical edge for consistent operation.

Strategic Partnership with Uber

Volkswagen’s deal with Uber aims to deploy thousands of ID.Buzz AVs across U.S. cities over the next decade, starting with a 2026 Los Angeles launch. Initially, human safety drivers will monitor operations, with full driverless service targeted for 2027, pending regulatory approval. The minivans, built on Volkswagen’s Moia platform, are designed for ride-hailing, offering seating for up to seven passengers and powered sliding doors for easy access.

Volkswagen plans to sell these vehicles as a complete package—hardware, software, and fleet management—to transport providers, leveraging its manufacturing scale to reduce costs compared to retrofitted EVs used by competitors.

Industry Trends and Economic Impact

The robotaxi market is heating up, with Alphabet’s Waymo operating 250,000 weekly rides and Chinese firms like Baidu expanding rapidly. Volkswagen’s entry reflects a broader industry shift toward shared, electric, and autonomous mobility. By integrating with Uber’s ride-hailing network, the ID.Buzz AV could capture significant market share, especially in dense urban areas.

Economically, the autonomous vehicle sector is projected to grow substantially, with the U.K. alone estimating a $58 billion boost from self-driving tech. Volkswagen’s cost-efficient approach, sharing sensors with Porsche and Audi, positions it to compete without the heavy losses faced by others like GM’s Cruise, which burned over $10 billion before scaling back.

Regulatory and Operational Hurdles

Navigating U.S. regulations will be critical. California’s Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Utilities Commission oversee autonomous vehicle testing and commercial deployment, requiring rigorous safety validations. Volkswagen’s phased approach—starting with safety drivers—aims to build trust and meet these standards.

In Europe, where regulations are stricter, full autonomy is expected by 2027. “We will scale at the speed of trust,” said Sascha Meyer, Moia’s CEO, emphasizing a cautious rollout to ensure reliability and public acceptance.

What It Means for EV Enthusiasts

For EV owners and enthusiasts, the ID.Buzz AV showcases the potential of electric platforms in autonomous applications. Its retro-inspired design, combined with cutting-edge tech, makes it a compelling option for urban transport.

As Volkswagen ramps up production, the ID.Buzz could drive wider EV adoption by offering sustainable, driverless mobility, reducing reliance on fossil fuel-powered taxis. With testing underway and a clear U.S. roadmap, Volkswagen is steering toward a future where electric robotaxis redefine how we move.

The government launched the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program in 2019, which gave car buyers up to $5,000 toward the cost of an electric vehicle.","OTTAWA — An environmental think tank is warning the federal government against repealing its electric vehicle mandate, instead suggesting that politicians should be helping to put more EVs on the road.

In a statement published Friday, Clean Energy Canada gave three recommendations to the federal government to help deliver affordable EVs to Canadians for less than $40,000.

The group, based out of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said Ottawa should retool its EV mandate by revisiting its near-term targets to help the auto sector “weather this temporary storm” of slumping EV sales.

“Any additional flexibility added in the regulation should be designed to achieve other EV-related goals, such as delivering more affordable EVs and building out Canada’s charging network,” says the statement by executive director Rachel Doran and director of public affairs Joanna Kyriazis.

The plea comes on the heels of auto manufacturing leaders meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney last week, in which the CEOs repeated their calls for the mandate to be repealed.

Starting next year, the mandate would require 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada to be zero-emission vehicles. Those also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The target rises annually to 100 per cent by 2035.

Recent data from Statistics Canada suggests EVs accounted for 7.53 per cent of all new vehicles sold in April.

Following the meeting, the head of an organization representing Ford Canada, GM Canada and Stellantis said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" the government would take action on the mandate.

Clean Energy Canada also called on Ottawa to re-fund the EV incentive program, but to be clearer as to when the program will be phased out.

The government launched the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program in 2019, which gave car buyers up to $5,000 toward the cost of an electric vehicle. The program was abruptly suspended back in January when its funding ran out.

It has left many dealerships on the hook for the rebate if they hadn't already sent in their claim before the program ended. The federal government put nearly $3 billion into the program during its lifespan.

""The rebate should start at $5,000 and decline by $1,000 each year, providing consumers and automakers with a well-communicated phaseout that avoids periods of artificially lowered EV sales as buyers await the return of rebates or at least clarity,"" Clean Energy Canada says.

A similar policy is in place in Quebec.

Federal ministers have said in recent months that the government was working toward bringing back consumer incentives on EVs.

Those promises faced criticism from automakers themselves because, without implementing a rebate, EV sales are slumping further, as buyers wait for the rebates to come back.

Clean Energy Canada also called on the federal government to reconsider its approach to cheaper EVs from China, which are subject to a 100 per cent tariff which took effect in October. Ottawa is scheduled to review the measure later this year.

""Allowing in a limited quota of these affordable vehicles while also recognizing EU-approved vehicles … would open Canada’s vehicle market to fill important market gaps, drive innovation and ultimately make our auto sector more competitive,"" the group says.

Consider used EVs: As more models hit the market, prices on pre-owned electric cars are dropping.","Why this matters for you

For U.S. consumers, this isn’t just about bragging rights in the global auto race. It’s about what you’ll pay for your next vehicle.

If Chinese EVs enter Western markets without tariffs, they could undercut competitors by tens of thousands of dollars — bringing huge savings to consumers but serious threats to U.S. auto industry jobs. In response, the U.S. government has already imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, which may shield domestic automakers for now but also delay price competition.

Farley’s warning comes as more and more Americans are looking to switch to EVs amid soaring gas prices and expanding charging infrastructure. But since Tesla, Ford and GM EVs often start in the $40,000-$60,000 range, many Americans are priced out.

Can the U.S. catch up?

China’s advantage? It controls much of the world’s battery production and can bring new EVs to market in a fraction of the time compared to U.S. automakers.

Ford is working on a next-gen affordable EV platform intended to match China's costs but says it won't arrive until 2027. Tesla is also aiming to launch a $25,000 “Model 2,” but timelines remain uncertain. Until then, the price gap persists.

One other fact is that Apple and Google just ""decided not to go into the car business,"" according to Farley. This has created significant barriers to the U.S. competing with the level of technological integration made available in Chinese vehicles.

""They have far superior in-vehicle technology. Huawei and Xiaomi are in every car,"" Farley added. ""You get in, you don't have to pair your phone. Automatically, your whole digital life is mirrored in the car.""

What you can expect next

For now, U.S. car buyers won’t see sub-$20,000 EVs on the lot — but pressure is mounting. Here’s how to stay ahead:

Watch for incentives: Federal EV tax credits can ease the price of U.S.-made electric cars.

Consider used EVs: As more models hit the market, prices on pre-owned electric cars are dropping. Just make sure you double-check the battery warranty before buying used.

Plan long-term: If you’re planning to switch to electric in the next few years, competition and innovation may bring prices down — eventually.

Ford and Farley are painfully aware that market dynamics are shifting.

Getting rid of these investments would also put many Arizonans who work in the clean energy industry out of work.
That’s why we urge Congress to protect — not repeal — these clean energy tax credits because they’re saving Arizonans money while delivering real benefits to our state and communities.","Scripture teaches us that we have a responsibility to care for all of God’s creation.

As faith leaders in Arizona, we have a duty to lead our congregations, but also to serve the broader community as well as future generations. For us, that means leaving the land, water and air we share better than we found it.

Arizona is already experiencing record-setting heat waves virtually every summer as well as ongoing drought, and the risk of weather disasters like wildfires and floods are more and more common. Just like other Arizona homeowners, we see higher and higher power bills because of these sustained weeks and months with temperatures over 100°F. But because of our responsibility as leaders of our congregations and in the communities we serve, we wanted to be proactive: transition to more clean energy usage, reduce our carbon footprint and reduce our utility costs.

As congregations, we rely on tithes from our members to pay for much of our operations, so we don’t keep large margins or cash reserves. Almost every dollar we receive goes back to the community, so we’re always looking for responsible ways to lower our costs. But we were worried about the possibility of high up-front costs preventing us from being able to make a decision that we knew would save more money over the long-term.

Fortunately, a few years ago Congress enacted clean energy tax credits that allow businesses, homeowners, nonprofits and houses of worship to transition to solar. Those tax credits reduced the cost of installation by 30% — a huge savings that will also result in lower utility costs over the long-term. And because we are tax exempt, we were able to apply for Direct Pay to enjoy those same savings.

For all of our congregations, the 30% incentive was an important factor in the decision to make the investment in solar.

However, these important tax credits that thousands of Arizona households and nonprofits have been able to use to transition to solar, are in jeopardy. Congress is considering legislation that would repeal these incentives by the end of the year and raise the costs of investing in clean energy. In fact, we know of faith leaders who are hoping to take advantage of Direct Pay in the next year or two. Getting rid of these investments would also put many Arizonans who work in the clean energy industry out of work. That’s why we urge Congress to protect — not repeal — these clean energy tax credits because they’re saving Arizonans money while delivering real benefits to our state and communities.

Even as automakers pile on the financial incentives to entice buyers, EV sales are falling. In June they were lower by 6.2%, the third straight monthly decline for battery-powered cars, according to estimates from Motor Intelligence, an industry-research firm.

While Chantal may not pack the devastating punch of previous storms like Hurricane Helene, Duke Energy officials are warning residents that this storm carries its own unique set of dangers that could leave thousands without power for days. The combination of saturated ground conditions and unpredictable wind patterns has emergency crews on high alert across the region.

The utility giant is mobilizing crews across multiple states, positioning equipment and personnel in strategic locations to respond to what could become a complex and challenging restoration effort.

The storm’s approach comes at a particularly vulnerable time for the state’s power infrastructure. Recent weather patterns have already weakened tree root systems, making them more susceptible to toppling during high winds. This creates a domino effect that can take down power lines and leave entire neighborhoods in darkness.

The hidden dangers lurking in Chantal’s path

What makes Tropical Storm Chantal particularly concerning for energy crews isn’t just its wind speed, but the combination of factors that create perfect conditions for electrical disasters. The storm’s slow-moving nature means prolonged exposure to damaging winds and torrential storms that can saturate the ground beneath power poles and transmission towers.

Duke Energy‘s preparation strategy reflects lessons learned from previous storms that caught the company off guard. The utility has positioned crews not just along the coast where the storm is expected to make its most direct impact, but also throughout central North Carolina where seemingly minor weather events can cascade into major outages.

The company’s proactive approach includes pre-positioning bucket trucks, generators, and specialized equipment in areas that historically experience the most significant storm-related damage. This strategic deployment could mean the difference between hours and days of power restoration for affected customers.

Emergency response teams are particularly focused on protecting critical infrastructure that serves hospitals, emergency services, and essential businesses. These facilities receive priority attention during storm events, but the interconnected nature of the power grid means that damage in one area can ripple across entire regions.

Residents face tough choices as storm approaches

For families throughout North Carolina, Tropical Storm Chantal represents more than just another weather event. The storm’s timing during summer months means that extended power outages could create dangerous conditions for vulnerable populations, including elderly residents and those with medical conditions requiring electrical equipment.

Duke Energy is urging customers to take proactive steps now, before the storm arrives. This includes assembling emergency kits with flashlights, batteries, non-perishable food, and enough water for at least three days. The company also recommends unplugging non-essential electronics to prevent damage from power surges when electricity is restored.

The psychological impact of storm preparation cannot be understated. Many North Carolina residents are still recovering from previous hurricane seasons that left lasting trauma and financial hardship. The prospect of another major weather event, even one classified as a tropical storm, can trigger anxiety and stress that extends far beyond the immediate physical dangers.

Local emergency management officials are working closely with Duke Energy to coordinate response efforts and ensure that resources are deployed efficiently. This collaboration includes establishing emergency shelters, coordinating with local law enforcement, and maintaining communication systems that can operate independently of the main power grid.

Technology and tradition collide in storm response

Modern storm preparation involves sophisticated weather modeling, advanced communication systems, and real-time monitoring of electrical infrastructure. Duke Energy’s control centers can track outages as they occur and dispatch crews to the most critical locations first, maximizing the efficiency of restoration efforts.

However, the reality of storm response still depends heavily on traditional manual labor and human expertise. Skilled line workers must physically inspect damaged equipment, climb poles in dangerous conditions, and work long hours in challenging weather to restore power to affected communities.

The company’s investment in smart grid technology has improved its ability to isolate damaged sections of the electrical system, preventing minor problems from becoming major outages. This technology allows operators to remotely control switches and reroute power around damaged areas, reducing the overall impact on customers.

Despite these technological advances, the fundamental challenge remains the same: getting qualified workers to damaged equipment as quickly and safely as possible. This human element means that storm response is still limited by factors like road conditions, worker safety, and the availability of specialized equipment.

Economic implications extend beyond immediate costs

The economic impact of Tropical Storm Chantal extends far beyond the immediate costs of storm preparation and response. Extended power outages can devastate local businesses, spoil food supplies, and disrupt essential services that communities depend on for daily life.

Small businesses are particularly vulnerable to storm-related outages because they often lack the resources to invest in backup power systems or weather-resistant infrastructure. A restaurant that loses power for several days may be forced to discard thousands of dollars worth of perishable inventory, while retail stores may lose sales to competitors in unaffected areas.

The tourism industry, which is crucial to North Carolina’s coastal economy, faces particular challenges from storm events. Hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues that depend on summer visitors can see their busiest season disrupted by weather events that keep tourists away even after the immediate danger has passed.

Duke Energy’s preparation efforts include working with major commercial and industrial customers to ensure that critical facilities can maintain operations during and after the storm. This includes hospitals, manufacturing plants, and data centers that serve customers across multiple states.

Safety concerns top priority for utility workers

The men and women who will restore power after Tropical Storm Chantal face dangers that most people never consider. Working with high-voltage electrical equipment in wet, windy conditions requires specialized training and constant vigilance to prevent accidents that could prove fatal.

Duke Energy has implemented comprehensive safety protocols that sometimes slow down restoration efforts but are essential for protecting workers. These include mandatory safety briefings, specialized equipment inspections, and communication procedures that ensure crews can call for help if they encounter dangerous conditions.

The company’s emphasis on worker safety extends to interactions with the public during storm response. Motorists who encounter utility crews working along roadways are urged to slow down and move over, giving workers the space they need to perform their duties safely.

Emergency responders also face increased risks during storm events as they respond to calls for help while navigating dangerous road conditions and potential electrical hazards. The coordination between utility companies and emergency services is crucial for ensuring that both workers and the public remain safe during restoration efforts.

Long-term resilience requires ongoing investment

Tropical Storm Chantal serves as a reminder that North Carolina’s electrical infrastructure requires ongoing investment and maintenance to withstand increasingly frequent and severe weather events. Climate change has altered traditional storm patterns, creating new challenges for utility companies that must adapt their systems accordingly.

Duke Energy’s long-term strategy includes hardening electrical infrastructure through underground power lines in vulnerable areas, improved vegetation management, and upgraded equipment that can better withstand extreme weather conditions. These investments require significant capital expenditures that are ultimately reflected in customer rates.

The company is also exploring new technologies that could revolutionize storm response, including drone inspections of damaged equipment, advanced weather forecasting systems, and automated switching systems that can restore power without human intervention in certain circumstances.

As North Carolina residents prepare for Tropical Storm Chantal’s arrival, the focus remains on immediate safety and emergency preparedness. However, the storm also highlights the ongoing need for resilient infrastructure that can support communities through whatever challenges future weather events may bring.

The next few days will test both the preparedness of utility companies and the resilience of communities across North Carolina. While no one can predict exactly how Tropical Storm Chantal will impact the state, the extensive preparation efforts underway demonstrate the serious commitment to keeping residents safe and restoring normal life as quickly as possible after the storm passes.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2511389829-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 15:05:53.501574

Plug Power, a U.S. company that builds clean hydrogen plants, just got huge support. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) gave it a conditional loan guarantee of up to $1.66 billion. This will help Plug Power build six large hydrogen factories across the U.S.

Boosts green hydrogen production in America

Plug will supply hydrogen to Amazon, Walmart, and Home Depot

Could make clean hydrogen common and affordable

What Is Green Hydrogen?

Green hydrogen is made by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity from renewable energy like wind or solar. This process is clean and does not use fossil fuels.

Step What Happens Why It’s Good 1 Water is split into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity No pollution 2 Electricity comes from solar or wind power 100% clean energy 3 Hydrogen is stored and used in vehicles or factories Good for the planet

Where Are the New Projects?

Plug Power will build six green hydrogen plants in the U.S.

Graham, Texas – “Project Limestone” (45 tons/day using wind power)

Woodbine, Georgia – Already running (25 tons/day plant)

Others planned in California, Louisiana, Tennessee, and New York

All plants will use PEM (proton exchange membrane) electrolyzers, which are very efficient and powered by renewable energy.

How the Loan Works

This is a loan guarantee, not free money. The DOE helps Plug Power get loans at a lower interest rate by backing the loan in case of failure. Plug still has to pay it back.

Big Business Plans

Goal: 500 tons/day of hydrogen by 2025

Each plant may cost $250 million

Each may produce up to 15 tons/day

Tax Credit Support

Plug Power plans to use the 45V hydrogen tax credit, which gives up to $3 per kg of clean hydrogen produced. But some lawmakers may try to end it early, which could hurt Plug’s future funding.

What This Means for Investors

After the announcement, Plug Power’s stock price jumped. Other hydrogen companies also saw a boost.

But Plug lost $1.4 billion in 2023

It lost another $296 million in early 2024

The company has never made a profit

So while this is a big win, investors must be careful. The company is still in a risky position.

Why This Is Good for the Planet

Clean Energy Growth

Each plant will use wind, solar, or hydropower

Zero carbon emissions when running properly

Energy Independence

With red, white, and blue bunting draped across the White House, and fighter jets roaring overhead in a choreographed flyover, Trump used the moment to portray himself as a president who delivers—on the battlefield, in the courtroom, and now in Congress.

“Promises made, promises kept—and we’ve kept them,” he declared, moments before using a ceremonial gavel gifted by House Speaker Mike Johnson to seal the bill’s passage.

The signing capped weeks of bruising intraparty wrangling and a months-long legislative slog, as Republicans rushed to pass the multitrillion-dollar package before Trump’s self-imposed July 4 deadline. The final law extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, eliminates taxes on tips and Social Security income, and makes sweeping cuts to Medicaid and food stamp programs—long-standing Republican targets that now stand gutted.

A Fight on the Right: Trump vs. His Base

But beyond its staggering fiscal scope and deeply polarizing content, the bill’s passage is also notable for the political firestorm it ignited within the president’s own party. In achieving what may be his most consequential legislative victory to date, Trump bulldozed opposition not just from Democrats, but from prominent voices on the right, including allies like Elon Musk and high-profile conservative lawmakers who openly questioned the bill’s long-term consequences.

For months, Trump lobbied aggressively to unify Republicans around the bill, knowing it would face total resistance from Democrats. But the real battle played out within the GOP itself.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk—long seen as an unofficial Trump adviser and one of his most influential outside supporters—publicly opposed the legislation’s size and scope, especially provisions cutting funding for tech-friendly energy programs and expanding federal surveillance under the guise of immigration enforcement. Musk reportedly urged congressional allies to vote against the bill, arguing it betrayed “economic freedom” and marked a return to “bloated federal overreach.”

His resistance was part of a broader split on the American right, where fiscal conservatives and libertarian-leaning Republicans balked at the bill’s $3.3 trillion projected impact on the national debt. In the House, two Republicans broke ranks—most notably Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian conservative who has frequently clashed with Trump despite aligning with him ideologically. Massie condemned the package as “fiscally insane” and a “betrayal of the limited government principles the party once claimed to stand for.”

In the Senate, North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis went a step further, publicly opposing the bill and announcing he would not seek reelection. Tillis had long warned that slashing healthcare access for millions while handing tax breaks to billionaires would backfire politically. His stance earned him the ire of Trump’s political apparatus, which swiftly began supporting potential challengers for his Senate seat.

The legislation narrowly passed the Senate thanks to Vice President J.D. Vance, who broke a 50-50 tie by casting the deciding vote. Though once a Trump skeptic, Vance has emerged as a reliable enforcer of the president’s agenda.

A Full-Scale Dismantling of the Democratic Legacy

The bill marks a sweeping rejection of the policy architecture laid by former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. It repeals large parts of the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, claws back climate-related tax credits enacted under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, and guts key provisions aimed at helping low-income families.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the package will push nearly 12 million Americans off health coverage and reduce food assistance eligibility for millions more. At the same time, it devotes tens of billions to building new migrant detention centers, expands federal immigration enforcement, and beefs up surveillance programs across the southern border.

Trump defended the cuts as necessary tradeoffs to spur what he described as an “economic rocket ship.” Speaking to Fourth of July attendees before signing the bill, he said, “We’re going to make this country the strongest, the richest, and the freest it’s ever been. That starts with getting Washington out of your pocket and your doctor’s office.”

Democrats were quick to respond. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin condemned the law as “devastating,” accusing Trump and Republicans of “handing billionaires a $5 trillion gift while robbing working families of basic dignity.”

AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler echoed the criticism, calling the bill “the worst job-killing legislation in modern history” and warning it would leave tens of millions “more vulnerable, more desperate, and more disposable.”

A Campaign Blueprint—and a Midterm Battleground

As the fireworks display began and Trump and First Lady Melania danced on the Truman Balcony to “Y.M.C.A.”—a now-familiar campaign anthem—the president’s political machine was already shifting into campaign mode. The White House framed the bill not just as a policy achievement, but as the cornerstone of Trump’s 2026 midterm strategy.

Party officials confirmed that Republican leadership is planning a “victory tour” to showcase the bill’s key promises in swing states, while Democrats are preparing to use it as a rallying cry for what they say is a betrayal of the American working class.

Plans for nationwide rallies, protest vigils, voter registration drives, and targeted ad campaigns are already underway. The DNC has reportedly commissioned a series of attack ads focused on Republicans in vulnerable districts, tying them directly to the Medicaid and food stamp cuts, and the bill’s $3.3 trillion projected addition to the national debt.

Polls show a country divided. A Washington Post/Ipsos survey found that while most Americans support eliminating taxes on tips and boosting child tax credits, majorities oppose slashing food assistance and expanding immigration detention spending. Nearly 60 percent said it was “unacceptable” for the bill to increase the national debt beyond its current $36 trillion level.

For Trump, however, the legislative win is personal. After a flurry of Supreme Court victories and a show of military strength following the bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities last month, the budget bill adds to a string of momentum that could shape the tone of the 2026 elections.

But even some within his party warn that the bill’s real consequences may only be felt months from now—when families begin losing Medicaid, food insecurity spikes, and the debt begins to climb faster than projected.",https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/06081219/Trump-bill.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 19:05:33.534540

Elon Musk's announcement of the America Party—a direct rebuke of Donald Trump's fiscal policies and a bid to disrupt the two-party system—has sent shockwaves through markets and policy circles. While its viability remains uncertain, Musk's influence on Tesla (TSLA), SpaceX, and renewable energy could redefine regulatory landscapes, creating both risks and opportunities for investors. Let's dissect the stakes.

The Political Landscape: A Third-Way Gamble

The America Party's core mission—fiscal conservatism, debt reduction, and deregulation—aligns with Musk's business interests but faces steep hurdles. Experts like Dafydd Townley note that third parties in the U.S. face systemic barriers: only 40% of voters would even consider them, and ballot access rules (e.g., California's 75,000-signature requirement) are daunting. Musk's foreign birth (he became a citizen in 2002) also bars him from the presidency, limiting direct control.

Yet, the party's targeted strategy—influencing 2-3 Senate and 10 House seats to become a “deciding vote”—could reshape legislation. Musk's feud with Trump adds volatility: the latter has threatened to review SpaceX's government contracts, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called the party's political viability “a distraction from his core businesses.”

Tech Sector: Deregulation and Rocket Fuel

The America Party's stance on AI, space, and compute governance could be a goldmine for innovators.

AI and Free Speech: Musk opposes overregulation, arguing it stifles innovation. This benefits firms like NVIDIA (NVDA) (GPU leader) and C3.ai (AI) (enterprise AI). However, Musk's maximalist free-speech advocacy (via X) clashes with regulatory realities; the SEC's ongoing litigation over his Twitter takeover highlights compliance risks.

SpaceX and Defense Contracts: The party's push for “military modernization with AI/robotics” aligns with SpaceX's $1.8B Pentagon contracts for spy satellites. Partners like Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) could see tailwinds, but fiscal conservatives may balk at open-ended space spending.

Regulatory Risks: SpaceX's FAA fines ($633K proposed in 2023) and environmental probes underscore vulnerabilities. Musk's antitrust issues (e.g., Neuralink's brain-implant ambitions) add to the regulatory minefield.

Energy Sector: Subsidies, Solar, and the Nuclear Edge

Musk's anti-subsidy rhetoric creates a paradox: Tesla and SolarCity (now Tesla Energy) rely on federal grants and tax credits.

Renewables: The party's opposition to “debt slavery” could cut green subsidies, hitting solar firms like SunPower (SPWR). However, Musk's push for “market-driven decarbonization” could boost Tesla's Powerwall and grid storage (e.g., NextEra Energy (NEE)).

Nuclear Power: The America Party's support for tax credits (Sections 45U/Y/E) could accelerate projects like the Texas Clean Energy Hub. Firms like Exelon (EXC) (nuclear-heavy utility) and Dominion Energy (D) (grid modernization) stand to gain.

Risks: The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act's renewable tax credits are under threat if fiscal hawks prevail. Investors should monitor SolarCity's ongoing federal probes over past subsidy misuse.

Investment Strategies: Navigate the Musk Quake

Long Positions:

Tesla (TSLA): Musk's influence ensures it remains central to energy and AI policy debates.

SpaceX-linked stocks: Maxar Technologies (MAXR) (Starlink supplier) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE) (space tourism).

Nuclear plays: Exelon (EXC) and Westinghouse (nuclear tech).

Hedge Against Deregulation Risks:

Compute governance leaders: Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM) for ethical AI frameworks.

Semiconductors: AMD (AMD) and NVIDIA (NVDA) as tech staples.

Short Bets:

Subsidy-reliant EVs: Nikola (NKLA) or Lordstown Motors (RIDE) if tax credits are phased out.

Monitor:

FEC recognition of the America Party (a key hurdle).

2026 midterms (target states like South Dakota).

EU's AI Act and U.S. antitrust probes (e.g., Neuralink).

Conclusion: A High-Risk, High-Reward Gamble

The America Party's success hinges on Musk's ability to navigate political minefields while keeping his companies competitive. For investors, the upside lies in deregulation-driven tech and nuclear/grid infrastructure, but risks—regulatory pushback, third-party futility, and Musk's own contradictions—are real.

Stay agile: overweight tech infrastructure now, but keep a close eye on the FEC's moves and congressional dynamics. Musk's vision could reshape industries—or crumble under political gravity.",,N,,2025-07-07 04:03:22.372874

After all, Trump was speaking to the damage done to once-proud manufacturing hubs due to forces like globalization — a frequent target of Trump and today’s political right. Flint appears to be the kind of city that Trump believes his agenda, particularly the sweeping tariffs he is imposing, will revitalize.

But regardless of how his often-haphazard trade policy unfolds, the Trump administration is making other moves that are already having the opposite effect in Flint: 11 years after the city’s water famously became toxic, the administration is lifting water and environmental quality controls, canceling research to monitor residents’ health and upending early education programs. The net result is that Trumponomics will actually impede the critical revitalization efforts that are needed in the Rust Belt.

In addition to tariffs, Trump’s economic proposals focus on steep de-regulation and tax incentives for corporations. They’re designed to promote economic growth with little attention to the culture and health of people in the communities they affect. This means that the administration’s policies inevitably come at the expense of critical environmental protections and public health measures that are already greatly imperiled in the many low-income communities like Flint that dot the Midwest.

As a public health researcher as well as someone born and raised in the city, I can already see this happening. But generally speaking, there should always be concern when the value and strength of a community is perceived solely in terms of its economic output, rather than the quality of life of its people.

Just five months into Trump 2.0, Flint is already an emblem of what’s going wrong with the new administration’s plans for post-industrial cities like mine. Policies designed to stimulate economic growth will fail to revitalize cities like Flint unless they are accompanied by efforts to repair the social and environmental damage that previous failed policies left behind.

It’s also an object lesson in how reflexive austerity is nearly always bad for public health.

Flint was the birthplace of General Motors and an essential part of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “Arsenal of Democracy” against the Axis powers in World War II. A generation ago, it sat atop the automobile industry as a predominantly white city with a booming middle class. However, over time, consumers began to seek out vehicles from foreign competitors like Honda and Toyota that were not only more reliable and more fuel efficient, but also cheaper. Simultaneously, NAFTA, and the precursors to it, paved the way for American automakers to more rapidly move production to other countries to take advantage of lower labor costs.

The result in Flint and cities like it was a rapid process of deindustrialization, and many of the socioeconomic ills that come with that — white flight, unemployment, crime, distressed natural environments and diminished public health.

In 2014, what became known as the Flint Water Crisis marked the nadir of that decline and brought the impact of the collapse of the country’s manufacturing industry, and potential consequences, into clear focus.

In fact, being known as the city with the nation’s worst tap water was a potentially modest upgrade from Flint’s prior reputation as one of America’s murder capitals. In the last few years, however, Flint has largely avoided the national headlines, at least since a $626 million in civic settlement funds were approved in 2021 to make amends for the massive manmade environmental disaster. (To date, none of those funds have been paid out to residents.)

In important ways, the water crisis had its roots in the kind of cost-cutting policy approaches that Trump favors. In 2014, officials in Flint made the fateful decision to switch the city’s primary water source from Lake Huron, one of the Great Lakes, to the Flint River. At the time, the city was under the de facto leadership of Darnell Earley, an “emergency manager” who had been appointed by the state’s Republican governor, Rick Snyder. The decision from Earley, an unelected bureaucrat, was part of a broad set of austerity measures curated by the state’s Republican leadership to address the city’s chronic budget shortfalls. The city’s engineering plan to reroute its water supply went through a porous, truncated assessment, little public debate, and relied on a workforce weakened by parallel environmental programming cuts across the city and state.

Within days, residents began raising concerns — the tap water was pungent, murky and had an unsavory taste. Local public works officials largely ignored or downplayed the worries, telling residents that the water source switch would simply have some innocuous growing pains. And then residents began reporting that the water appeared to be giving them skin rashes and causing hair loss. Even leaders at General Motors chimed in, eventually telling the state that it was shutting off the new water at one of its factories due to the water corroding its manufacturing materials. Seeking to avoid upsetting by far the city’s largest employer, the state soon switched the automaker’s factory back to the city’s original water source. But it didn’t change it back for residents.

It wasn’t until nearly two years later that the true scope of the crisis was evident. The flashpoint was a local pediatrician reporting an abnormal spike in lead levels in the blood of the city’s children. What followed was a flurry of media attention, a begrudging statement of acknowledgment from the state on the burgeoning crisis, and President Barack Obama declaring a state of emergency in Flint.

Since then, an unusually seamless level of coordination between federal, state and local officials and private philanthropy has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars being funneled to Flint for causes ranging from water infrastructure upgrades to early education programming. Over the last four years, lead levels in Flint’s water have consistently tested within scientifically acceptable ranges. And highly innovative, progressive programs like the RxKids program, which provides direct cash assistance to pregnant women and new mothers in Flint, were launched in direct response to the crisis.

However, those positive developments belie the scale of destruction that the water crisis has otherwise wrought, destruction that’s about to get worse if the Trump administration follows through on its plans.

Just this week, Michigan officials announced the completion of a gargantuan, oft-delayed effort to replace Flint’s lead pipes — more than 11 years after the crisis began.

In the interim, Flint’s suffering continued. The city shed roughly a fifth of its population, about 20,000 residents, along with a substantial chunk of its already shrinking and low-wage-earning tax base. These startling changes in density directly impact the ability of the city to adequately support its remaining population; the city now lacks the resources it needs to tend to its infrastructure, public health and education systems.

Researchers like me have been laser-focused on the potential consequences of elevated exposure to lead on Flint residents, particularly children and pregnant women in the city who would be uniquely vulnerable. In the environmental sciences, lead looms large as an invisible, odorless and tasteless neurotoxin that is deeply associated with conditions like cognitive delays, physical impairment, autism and ADHD. For these reasons, as well as its incurability, scientists increasingly regard lead asa key force in social and economic inequality.

In research from my team that was conducted in 2019, five years after the crisis started, Flint residents reported a significant uptick in neurological and developmental issues among their adolescent children. Another group of researchers found that fertility rates in Flint dipped by 12 percent and that overall health at birth decreased. And roughly 29 percent of Flint adultsthat we surveyed showed heightened signs of posttraumatic stress disorder in relationship to the water crisis. These are just a few of the harrowing results of studies conducted in Flint in the aftermath of one of the nation’s most tragic — and preventable — environmental disasters.

Yet these kinds of social, economic and environmental inequities are exactly what the Trump administration doesn’t want to address, or that they believe will magically disappear when manufacturing makes its triumphant return — making the forecast for recovery for Flint and its residents much more concerning. Some of the negative consequences are already showing up.

In March, the Environmental Protection Agency highlighted plans to roll back protections under the Clean Water Act that set pollution limits and aid monitoring efforts. Inexplicably, the EPA is currently in the midst of its third extension to decide if it’ll support the lead and copper regulations that were strengthened by the Biden administration in response to lessons learned from Flint’s water crisis. And with Trump’s new prohibitions now in place on the funding of research and programs addressing environmental injustice — of which the water crisis in Flint is emblematic — dozens of previously awarded grants to Flint researchers and community groups are susceptible to truncation or complete defunding. In March, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy indicated that the Department of Transportation would be eliminating a Biden-era request for state agencies to consider social justice and environmental concerns in infrastructure project decisions, making communities like Flint deeply vulnerable — again — to both manmade and natural environmental crises.

Trumponomics’ impacts also extend to Flint’s public education system, which is currently poised to lose roughly $15.6 million in federal funding due to the Department of Education’s recent decision to cancel Covid relief funds that were previously set to expire in 2026. Along with Trump’s proposed elimination of the Department of Education, which is vital for providing guidance and support on programming for children with disabilities (including those caused by lead exposure), cuts of this nature are poised to deal another blow to early education support in Flint as the volume of children needing it likely significantly increases.

In 2018, officials launched the Flint Registry, a tool that not only aids Flint residents in finding health services and programs, but also serves as a crucial data repository for tracking health outcomes in the city, enabling researchers and practitioners to better understand the consequences of the crisis and improve their response to it. The registry, whose vital work has stalled due to Trump’s orders, was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Trump administration plans to cleave the CDC’s workforce by roughly 18 percent, including ing some 2,400 employees who focused on environmental monitoring as well as grant administration and support.

It’s unclear whether somewhere in the hazy future, Trump’s gambles with tariffs will restore manufacturing in places like Flint. While campaigning in 2016, Trump, who visited Flint twice during his initial presidential run and once during his latest run, once observed, “It used to be, cars were made in Flint and you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can’t drink the water in Flint.”

His quip wasn’t far off, but a larger point was missed. Tariffs might restart some level of domestic manufacturing, but without deeper investment in our social and public health infrastructure, cities like Flint won’t recover and will remain unable to offer its residents either manufacturing jobs or clean water — or much else.",https://static.politico.com/54/31/5b927a874de4afd6061ab6a9432b/mag-ezell-rustbelt.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 16:06:08.118497

Posted on 07 July, 2025

Tax credits designed to incentivise the uptake of EVs in the United States will be axed from the end of September after a wide-ranging bill was passed by the US Congress.

The House of Representatives voted 218 to 214 on July 3 (US time) to pass President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”, which is designed to cut taxes and spending.

Not due to any technical glitch or water shortage, but simply because their cooling rivers were too warm to use safely.

It sounds strange — almost backwards — but yes, a power plant can overheat when the river meant to cool it gets too hot itself. But what happened in France and Switzerland is rewriting the rules about where and how we produce energy. This is what happens when the system that relies on for climate solutions begins to stumble under the weight of climate itself.

Too hot to cool, when rivers become a risk

In July, engineers at the Golfech plant in southern France had no choice but to shut things down. The nearby Garonne River had crept past 28°C, the legal limit for drawing cooling water, and even the seawater wasn’t safe to use.

In Switzerland, business operators also face the same dilemma, with air temperatures climbing past 25° Celsius for several days, and they were taken offline one after the other.

Most nuclear plants require cool water to maintain the reactors within safe operating limits.

The system is simple, with the strategy being to repel water from a nearby river, run it through the plant, and return it downstream slightly warmer.

But when the river’s already running warm, even a small spike can push ecosystems out of balance — and make plant operations risky fast.

It’s not the first time, but it’s more frequent.

Something similar happened back in 2018. Heatwaves forced several plants across France, Sweden, and Germany offline — and now it’s starting to feel less like an exception. A year later, it happened again. France’s Rhône and Rhine-cooled plants reduced output during another scorching summer just to avoid overheating the river.

In 2022, France is already dealing with major maintenance delays across its ageing reactors. When heatwaves struck in July and August, five plants received emergency waivers to continue operating despite exceeding temperature limits, and regulators framed this as a last resort and a matter of public necessity.

In 2025 Switzerland learning from the past 25° Celsius while France still navigated public debate after the 2022 exemptions this time.

The science has not changed; the climate has, and it has higher stakes. This has become part of a seasonal routine, discussed alongside wildfire alerts and water restrictions.

The difference is that energy doesn’t burn out; it fades quietly. When huge amounts catch up to infrastructure that was designed for a cooler path.

Green power needs climate protection

If climate change is reshaping the seasons, then the systems that were built decades ago, even the ones meant to fight that change, will have to evolve.

To rethink the infrastructure and update the assumptions, we must prepare for the reality that our energy future won’t just be carbon-free, but also climate-proof. If rising sea temperatures increase, it can compromise the power plant. The problem isn’t just the plan, it’s how we’ve left the redesign.",https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-2025-07-06T181541.417.png,N,,2025-07-06 15:05:40.087814

The analysis begins by examining the impact of AI development on energy efficiency (EE), with regression results presented in Table 2.
First, it replaces the CCR model-derived measure of energy efficiency with a single-factor energy efficiency (EE) measure81.","In recent decades, as globalization has accelerated and environmental challenges have intensified, sustainable development has emerged as a shared global priority1. In 2015, the United Nations launched the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), urging countries to align economic growth with environmental responsibility and aiming for substantial progress by 2030 to ensure a safer and more equitable future2. Among these goals, energy efficiency plays a pivotal role in achieving sustainable development3,4. In the face of rising geopolitical tensions5 intensifying climate change6 and growing uncertainty, the efficient use of energy has become essential for national development.

Extensive research has identified multiple determinants of energy efficiency, including financial development7,8 carbon emission trading9,10,11 fiscal decentralization12 manufacturing agglomeration13,14 and policy uncertainty15. These factors, grounded in diverse theoretical frameworks, influence energy efficiency through different mechanisms. More recently, digital technologies have attracted growing scholarly attention for their transformative impact on energy systems. Technological advancements are reshaping energy production, operations, and transmission processes. Within the broader context of sustainable development, digital innovation is accelerating the transition toward greener, low-carbon practices16. These technologies have been shown to enhance energy efficiency, modernize energy infrastructure, and restructure energy consumption patterns16,17,18. Drawing on the theory of technological innovation, several studies underscore the beneficial effects of digital transformation—highlighting its role in upgrading industrial structures, optimizing energy use, and improving overall efficiency19. However, some scholars caution that the development of digital infrastructure may also entail adverse environmental consequences, potentially undermining sustainability objectives6. Among the emerging technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) has distinguished itself as a transformative driver of future innovation. In 2022, the number of AI-related patents granted annually has surpassed 62,000—more than seven times the figure recorded in 2018. By the end of 2023, AI systems had equaled or exceeded human performance on standardized assessments in domains such as image classification, basic reading comprehension, natural language reasoning, multilingual understanding, and visual reasoning. Only in areas such as visual common-sense reasoning and complex mathematical problem-solving does AI still lag behind human capabilities (Artificial Intelligence Index Report, 2024).

The integration of AI into the energy sector is increasingly recognized for its transformative potential to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy sources and enhance energy efficiency. Through advanced data analytics, predictive modeling, and automation, AI facilitates smarter decision-making, optimizes energy distribution, and promotes the adoption of renewable energy technologies, thereby contributing to a more resilient and sustainable energy system20,21,22. Proponents argue that AI is reshaping the landscape of energy management and sustainability, driving high-quality urban development and generating measurable environmental benefits, including improved energy efficiency and enhanced ecological outcomes23,24. However, despite these advantages, the energy-intensive nature of AI technologies poses potential risks to overall energy efficiency. Training and operating AI models require substantial computational resources25 which can lead to increased carbon dioxide emissions and environmental degradation19,26. Furthermore, the dependence of AI systems on massive datasets indirectly amplifies the carbon footprint of the information technology sector. For example, data centers in the United States alone account for approximately 2% of national energy consumption. Globally, projections suggest that by 2030, the energy consumption of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector could reach 20% of total energy use, underscoring its growing role in the global energy landscape17,27.

Given the rapid advancement of AI and its dual potential to both transform and challenge sustainable energy use, empirical investigation into its effects is critical. This study centers on China, offering valuable insights into the relationship between AI development and energy efficiency. According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (China), the country’s AI industry exceeded 500 billion RMB by 2023, encompassing over 4,500 enterprises. As the world’s largest energy consumer and a leading developing nation28,29 China’s pursuit of energy efficiency holds significant implications for global sustainability, particularly for other developing economies. The rapid growth of AI in China presents a unique opportunity to assess its impact and to explore pathways for integrating AI into sustainable development strategies.

Previous studies have predominantly relied on metrics such as the number of industrial robots or AI-related patent applications to assess AI development30,31,32 often focusing on production processes and technological innovation. While informative, these metrics tend to emphasize specific technologies and their direct effects on energy consumption, potentially overlooking AI’s broader and more systemic influence across sectors. To address this gap, this study employs a fixed-effects model using prefecture-level data from Chinese cities to evaluate the relationship between AI development and energy efficiency.

This research advances the literature in four key ways: (1) Unlike prior studies that use proxies such as industrial robots or patent counts, we assess the influence of AI enterprises, offering a more robust reflection of the practical and commercial dimensions of AI implementation. (2) Moving beyond simplistic indicators like the energy-to-GDP ratio, we adopt a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model based on the Charnes–Cooper–Rhodes (CCR) approach, allowing for a nuanced assessment of energy efficiency across multiple inputs and outputs. (3) We investigate the pathways through which AI impacts energy efficiency, providing an in-depth understanding of the mediating mechanisms that drive these effects. (4) By investigate the functional boundaries of AI in influencing energy efficiency, we offer a clearer picture of its potential scope. By addressing these research gaps, the study delivers critical insights into the direct effects of AI on energy efficiency, especially by unpacking the mechanisms that link AI development with sustainable energy outcomes. The findings offer actionable strategies for policymakers and industry stakeholders, fostering evidence-based decision-making in the integration of AI technologies to support global sustainability goals.

The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a comprehensive review of the literature and introduces the theoretical hypotheses. Section 3 describes the data sources and research methodology. Section 4 reports the results of the empirical analysis. Section 5 provides extended analysis, focusing on the moderating effects. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the key conclusions and discusses the policy implications and limitations of the study.

Literature review

Key driver of energy efficiency

Efficient and renewable energy systems have been widely recognized as essential contributors to sustainable development by strengthening environmental governance33. Numerous studies have investigated the factors influencing energy efficiency. Among these, environmental considerations have played a pivotal role in shaping financial strategies—particularly through green finance policies, which allocate capital to environmentally sustainable initiatives and lay the groundwork for improved energy performance7,8. Building on this foundation, institutional mechanisms such as carbon trading systems offer market-based incentives to reduce emissions and promote more efficient resource allocation9,10,11. Furthermore, the role of industrial agglomeration has garnered increasing attention. Researchers have found that clustering industries can create economies of scale and generate positive externalities—such as knowledge spillovers—that streamline production processes and enhance energy utilization13,14.

The impact of digital technologies

Recently, , the global shift toward digital transformation—fueled by rapid advancements in digital technologies—has reshaped economic paradigms. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and other frontier technologies have emerged as key enablers of innovation and optimization in energy use across diverse sectors19. These advancements not only catalyze economic and social transformation but also foster further technological progress. As a result, growing academic interest is now directed toward understanding how digitalization influences production systems and alters energy consumption patterns.

Within the academic discourse, two divergent perspectives have emerged regarding the impact of digital technologies on energy transition. Proponents of the positive view argue that digital technologies have facilitated high-quality urban development while delivering measurable environmental benefits34. Enhanced innovation capacity35 has improved total factor productivity by optimizing human capital, integrating advanced manufacturing with modern service industries, and implementing cost-reduction strategies36,37, ultimately leading to gains in energy efficiency23,24. However, a contrasting view cautions that technological innovation may also drive-up carbon emissions due to the resource-intensive construction of digital infrastructure, thus exerting adverse effects on the ecological environment19,26.

The impact of AI

Artificial intelligence (AI), as a foundational element of digital technologies, has the potential to profoundly transform energy utilization and enhance efficiency, particularly in the manufacturing sector 21,22,38. Unlike other digital innovations, AI’s core functionalities can be classified into six critical domains: learning, perception, prediction, interaction, adaptation, and reasoning39. For instance, AI’s learning capability allows systems to improve performance over time, thereby increasing operational efficiency and effectiveness. Perception enables the interpretation of complex datasets and dynamic environments, supporting more informed decision-making40. Predictive capabilities facilitate accurate outcome forecasting, which is essential for strategic planning41. Interaction fosters seamless communication between humans and machines, enhancing user engagement and system responsiveness42. Adaptation allows AI systems to respond to novel conditions and tasks, maintaining their relevance and functionality40,43. Finally, reasoning enables AI to draw logical inferences and solve complex problems, effectively augmenting human cognitive capabilities. Empirical studies underscore AI’s impact on energy efficiency. For example, AI-driven ventilation control systems have achieved energy savings of approximately 26% in commercial buildings in the United States44. Unlike conventional digital tools, AI’s ability to autonomously make decisions, recognize patterns, and exhibit “human-like” scientific reasoning enables more nuanced management of production processes, thereby supporting greener manufacturing practices45. Collectively, these capabilities establish AI as a versatile and powerful enabler of innovation and efficiency across diverse industrial and technological domains. Nevertheless, the development and deployment of AI systems are energy-intensive, particularly during manufacturing, model training, and operational phases, potentially resulting in a substantial carbon footprint20.

A growing body of literature explores the complex relationship between AI and energy efficiency, yielding a range of perspectives. Several studies highlight AI’s potential to enhance energy performance, particularly in regions characterized by high levels of green innovation25, and within high-performing organizations where AI integration is more advanced46. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by the substantial energy demands associated with AI model development and training. High-performance computing for algorithm development, training cycles, and data center cooling consumes vast computational resources, contributing to elevated carbon emissions and environmental degradation19,25,26,47. The expansion of digital infrastructure, particularly at scale, exacerbates these challenges, as it entails considerable energy inputs for both construction and maintenance17,28,48,49.

Despite these concerns, AI presents transformative opportunities to address energy-related challenges through predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and automated control systems. As AI technologies are increasingly adopted across sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, and utilities, they offer sophisticated mechanisms to detect inefficiencies in energy consumption and enable precise, data-driven interventions to enhance operational efficiency50. These applications yield both direct and indirect environmental benefits. For instance, AI can optimize the timely input of production factors to maximize resource utilization51. Furthermore, the integration of intelligent automation within large-scale industrial ecosystems enables production lines to become more flexible, adaptive, self-aware, self-regulating, and capable of autonomous optimization52,53,54. Such advancements significantly reduce resource consumption and promote sustainability, yielding substantial gains in both environmental performance and industrial efficiency.

Literature gap

This literature review synthesizes current scholarship on energy efficiency and offers a comprehensive analysis of its influencing factors. Although considerable research has examined the impact of digital technologies and AI on energy efficiency, several critical gaps remain. Notably, much of the existing literature conflates AI with broader digital technologies, with limited studies isolating AI to examine its distinct effects. Furthermore, prior research often quantifies AI through proxies such as industrial robot density or patent data. In contrast, this paper emphasizes the practical application of AI technologies55,56,57. Additionally, prevailing studies typically assess energy efficiency using a unidimensional framework, such as the ratio of energy input to GDP output. This study adopts a more robust approach by employing the CCR model, which enables a multidimensional assessment of energy efficiency25,56. Most importantly, the underlying mechanisms through which AI influences energy efficiency remain underexplored. These research gaps underscore the need for further empirical investigation—particularly in China, where a nuanced understanding of AI’s role in energy consumption could enhance its applicability in developing economies.

Theoretical background and hypothesis

As outlined above, the relationship between AI and energy efficiency is multifaceted, encompassing both opportunities and challenges. When AI technologies transition from patent registration to real-world deployment, their energy usage dynamics evolve. Practical implementation often leads to system optimization and energy consumption reduction. This implies that AI’s capacity to improve energy efficiency is best realized through active application rather than theoretical modeling alone. In this regard, AI offers a unique advantage by integrating energy efficiency with adaptability, interactivity, and creativity22. This phenomenon aligns with the Solow paradox, which posits that the productivity gains from technological innovation are not immediately apparent but emerge gradually over time58. Innovation theory further supports the view that widespread adoption of AI can lead to significant improvements in productivity and operational efficiency. Given AI’s demonstrated potential to reduce energy consumption and disrupt conventional energy use patterns, this study advances the following hypothesis:

H1: AI development can improve energy efficiency.

Green technological innovation refers to enterprise-driven innovations aimed at conserving energy, reducing emissions, mitigating climate-related environmental damage, and enhancing ecological benefits. These innovations also contribute to the modernization of production technologies59. Empirical evidence suggests that AI development positively influences green innovation outcomes9. From the perspective of technological innovation, green innovation can reduce emissions from fossil fuels while promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources11. While green innovation may increase research and development expenditures, it simultaneously enhances productivity and enables effective management of wastewater, exhaust emissions, and solid waste during manufacturing. The implementation of stringent environmental regulations to stimulate technological innovation can significantly reduce environmental pollution without compromising production efficiency60. Accordingly, this study proposes Hypothesis 2:

H2: AI development enhances energy efficiency through fostering green technological innovation.

Prior research has established that energy intensity varies significantly across industrial sectors and that structural transformation can influence aggregate energy efficiency61. Notably, industrial structure is a critical determinant of carbon emissions. The configuration and composition of industries—particularly their dependence on energy-intensive technologies and processes—substantially shape the overall carbon footprint. As such, industrial restructuring has become increasingly central to sustainable development and climate change mitigation strategies62. Upgrading the industrial structure can reduce total carbon emissions by decreasing the share of high-energy-consuming sectors while expanding low-carbon and renewable energy industries. This structural shift not only curtails emissions but also fosters a more resilient and sustainable economic system, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change and advance environmental sustainability63. Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a catalytic role in driving industrial upgrading by optimizing and reshaping industrial configurations. The widespread deployment of AI is expected to revolutionize traditional technologies, thereby enabling a more rational, efficient, and innovation-driven industrial structure. AI and related innovation technologies accelerate industrial adaptation and advancement by promoting industrial clustering and enhancing operational efficiency through the adoption, integration, and diffusion of new technological paradigms64,65,66,67. Technological progress also generates significant capital reallocation and innovation-driven transformation. On one hand, capital—including physical, human, and institutional—tends to flow out of high-energy-intensive sectors and into knowledge-intensive, low-carbon industries. On the other hand, the advancement of emerging industries—characterized by superior energy efficiency and environmental performance—contributes to overall improvements in energy use. Based on this rationale, the present study proposes the following hypothesis:

H3: AI development boosts energy efficiency by rationalizing the industrial structure.

In exploring the mechanisms through which AI affects energy efficiency, it is equally important to examine the contextual conditions under which its influence may vary. Drawing on the theory of environmental regulation, prior empirical research indicates that such regulations exert a pronounced influence on both firms’ intentions to innovate and their actual innovation behaviors. This suggests that the effectiveness of AI in enhancing energy efficiency may be contingent upon the regulatory environment and the extent to which firms are incentivized to adopt green technologies. Environmental regulations heighten firms’ awareness of ecological concerns and promote engagement in green innovation activities. For instance, stringent policies can enhance firms’ recognition of the importance of environmental responsibility, thereby increasing their motivation to pursue green innovations68. In developing countries—where formal regulatory frameworks are often weak or inconsistently enforced—informal environmental regulation (IER) emerges as a pivotal mechanism for compelling polluters to take corrective action69. We argue that in such contexts, the impact of AI on energy efficiency is likely to be more substantial in environments characterized by higher levels of IER. Social pressure and public scrutiny, as key drivers of informal regulation, can incentivize firms to adopt AI technologies that reduce emissions and improve operational sustainability. These regulatory dynamics may foster a more conducive environment for AI adoption, thereby amplifying its potential to enhance energy efficiency. On this basis, we propose the following hypothesis:

H4: Informal environmental regulation amplifies the positive impact of AI on energy efficiency.

The developmental stage of a city significantly influences the extent to which AI can enhance energy efficiency. In China, approximately 44% of urban areas are classified as resource-based cities—urban centers whose economies rely heavily on the extraction and processing of natural resources such as minerals, water, and forests70. According to the resource curse theory, the finite nature of these resources implies that sustained extraction will eventually lead to their depletion71. Resource-based cities generally follow four developmental stages: growing, mature, declining, and regenerating. Each stage presents distinct challenges and opportunities for energy use and technological adoption. Growing resource-based cities possess abundant resources and are in the early phases of industrial expansion. These cities are increasingly exploring sustainable practices alongside resource development. Mature cities, having reached peak resource output after years of intensive exploitation, face the challenge of balancing economic growth with environmental preservation. Achieving this balance is vital for long-term sustainability, requiring deliberate efforts to mitigate environmental degradation while maintaining economic performance72. Declining resource-based cities confront the compounded challenges of resource exhaustion and economic instability. These cities must transition from a resource-dependent economy to one that is diversified and sustainable. This transition demands innovative policy measures and strategic interventions. AI can play a critical role in this transformation by identifying inefficiencies, optimizing remaining resources, and facilitating the shift toward sustainable practices. In regenerating cities, resource extraction has largely ceased, and efforts focus on ecological restoration and sustainable urban development. For these cities, AI is essential to supporting smart city initiatives, energy management systems, and environmental monitoring, all of which are key to achieving sustainable urban planning73. Empirical research indicates that the digital economy has a pronounced positive effect on energy efficiency in resource-dependent cities. However, this impact is less significant in cities with more diversified economies. The heightened responsiveness of resource-based cities may be attributed to their centralized industrial structures and initially lower energy efficiency baselines74. Consequently, these cities exhibit both a greater capacity and a more urgent need to leverage AI and other innovative technologies to optimize energy use. As natural resources inevitably dwindle, the priorities of resource-based cities evolve across different stages. In the early stages, the emphasis may be on maximizing extraction efficiency, while in later stages, the focus shifts toward sustainability and ecological recovery. Thus, the demand for AI applications to improve energy efficiency varies across stages, with the need becoming most acute in cities experiencing resource depletion and economic decline. Based on this context, we propose the following hypothesis:

H5: The stage of resource development in a resource-based city moderates the impact of AI on energy efficiency.

Figure 1 shows the conceptual framework.

Data source

The focus of our study is on the impact of AI on energy efficiency across Chinese cities. To empirically test our hypotheses, we employ a fixed-effects model using data compiled from five major sources. Because city-level energy consumption data are not publicly available, we follow established methodologies and use nighttime light intensity data from NOAA as a proxy for energy consumption75,76. Official energy data, standardized in tons of standard coal, are drawn from the China Energy Statistical Yearbook to facilitate calculation and comparison. Additional control variables—including GDP, industrial structure, income levels, educational attainment, population density, and demographic composition—are extracted from the China City Statistical Yearbook. AI enterprise data are identified using a keyword extraction technique applied to the business scope descriptions listed in the Tianyancha enterprise database. Furthermore, green patent data sourced from CNIPA provide insight into the level of technological innovation. All continuous variables are logarithmically transformed to stabilize variance and normalize distributions. After data collection and preprocessing, the final dataset comprises 4177 observations spanning the years 2006 to 2020.

Model settings

Drawing on existing research, we employ a two-way fixed effects panel model to control for both individual (city-level) and time-specific effects25. This model offers significant advantages in handling complex panel data by effectively reducing omitted variable bias and enhancing the precision of causal inference. The baseline specification is as follows:

$$\:{\text{E}\text{E}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}=\:{{\upalpha\:}}_{0}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{1}{\text{A}\text{I}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{2}{\text{d}\text{e}\text{n}\text{s}\text{i}\text{t}\text{y}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{3}{\text{s}\text{t}\text{r}\text{u}\text{c}\text{t}\text{u}\text{r}\text{e}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{4}{\text{p}\text{g}\text{d}\text{p}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{5}{\text{s}\text{o}2}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{6}{\text{e}\text{n}\text{e}\text{r}\text{g}\text{y}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upmu\:}}_{\text{i}}+{{\upgamma\:}}_{\text{t}}+{{\upepsilon\:}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}$$

(1)

where i denote the city and t the year. The dependent variable, EE, represents energy efficiency, while the key explanatory variable, AI, captures the artificial intelligence development index. Control variables include population density, industrial structure, per capita GDP (pgdp), sulfur dioxide emissions (so2), and energy consumption. City and year fixed effects are denoted by \(\:{{\upmu\:}}_{\text{i}}\) and \(\:{{\upgamma\:}}_{\text{t}}\) respectively.

Description of variables

Explained variable

Energy efficiency is a multifaceted concept with no universally accepted metric. Broadly, it refers to achieving the same level of output or service with reduced energy input—for example, using the ratio of energy consumption to GDP output as a proxy25. However, such single-factor indicators provide a limited, one-dimensional view that neglects interactions among multiple inputs and the presence of multiple outputs77,78.

These indicators typically focus solely on the energy–output relationship, overlooking the influence of other production factors such as labor and capital. To address this limitation, we adopt the CCR model within the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) framework, which evaluates relative efficiency using a non-parametric approach. This model incorporates a broader set of inputs—namely energy, labor, and capital—and a single output (GDP) to estimate each decision-making unit’s (DMU’s) position relative to a production frontier74. This methodology provides a holistic view of energy efficiency by comparing the performance of a DMU with peers that optimize input use for a given output or maximize output for a given level of input79. By integrating both technical and scale efficiency under the assumption of constant returns to scale80 the CCR model captures input–output interactions more comprehensively, providing a more accurate and holistic assessment of energy efficiency. Therefore, we construct our measure of energy efficiency using the CCR model rather than relying on single-factor indicators. For robustness checks, we further construct a measure of total factor energy efficiency using the SBM (Slack-Based Measure) model81,82,83.

Explanatory variable

Prior studies have commonly measured the level of AI development using two main approaches. The first relies on industrial robot data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR)30,31,32,84,85. While widely used, this method offers only a partial view and fails to capture the full spectrum of AI applications. The second approach uses AI-related patent data as a proxy for AI development. As a direct reflection of technological innovation, patent data enables precise identification of AI-specific technologies and has been increasingly employed to assess technological advancement86,87. Nevertheless, the number of AI-related patents is often used as a proxy for the level of R&D activity and the cumulative technological achievements in the AI domain. However, when examining energy consumption, the number of AI enterprises may serve as a more direct and relevant indicator. This is because enterprise count reflects the degree of industrial agglomeration and the extent to which the AI sector has matured in a given city. A growing number of AI enterprises typically signals the translation of R&D efforts into real-world applications and market-driven innovations25,88. Therefore, compared to patent counts, the number of AI enterprises offers a more comprehensive measure of both innovation output and its practical implementation.

Mediating variables

Green technology innovation (GTI). At the city level, green technology innovation is measured by taking the natural logarithm of the number of green patent applications plus one, to account for the potential of zero values and to normalize the data89.

Industrial Structure Rationalization (ISR). Following prior research, this study adopts the Theil index to evaluate the rationalization of industrial structure by assessing both sectoral coordination and resource allocation efficiency62. The Theil index quantifies disparities in output and employment across sectors, capturing the extent of structural imbalance at the city level, as shown in Eq. (2):

$$\:TL=\sum\:_{i=1}^{n}[\left(\frac{{Y}_{i}}{Y}\right)\text{l}\text{n}(\frac{{Y}_{i}}{{L}_{i}}/\frac{Y}{L}\:\left)\right]$$

(2)

In Eq. (2), TL denotes the Theil index, with Y and L representing total industrial output and labor force, respectively. Yi and Li refer to the output and employment of sector i, where i ranges from 1 to n, the total number of sectors. A lower Theil index approaching zero indicates a more rational industrial structure. This study calculates ISR for 284 cities over the period 2006–2020.

Moderating variables

Informal environment regulation (IER). To assess the moderating role of informal environmental regulation, the study employs a composite index constructed from indicators such as per capita income, population density, age structure, and educational attainment. These variables jointly capture the socio-economic conditions that influence public awareness and pressure for environmental protection, thus serving as proxies for informal regulatory mechanisms operating outside formal institutions.

To explore how informal environmental regulation moderates the impact, this research draws on the methodology of selecting a series of indicators such as income level, educational background, population density, and age structure to measure the extent of informal environmental regulation in cities90,91.

Stage of Resource City (SRC). Based on the National Resource-Based City Sustainable Development Plan (2013), resource-based cities are classified into four developmental stages: Growing, Mature, Declining, and Regenerating. In this study, these stages are numerically coded from 1 to 4, respectively, following the classification framework proposed by previous research70.

Control variables

In addition, we control for several variables commonly identified in the literature as influencing energy efficiency: (1) Population Density (density): Areas with higher population density often exhibit greater energy demand26. Population density is calculated based on the year-end total population57,92. (2) Industrial Structure (structure): This is measured by the share of tertiary industry value added in GDP, capturing the economic composition and its implications for energy use patterns. (3) GDP per Capita (pgdp): Reflecting regional economic development, GDP per capita is associated with higher living standards and greater awareness of sustainability concerns93. It is measured as the per capita GDP of urban residents. (4) Total Energy Consumption (energy): This variable captures the absolute scale of energy usage within a city, serving as a key control for evaluating energy efficiency94. (5) Environmental Pollution (so₂): Given that highly polluted regions often allocate more resources to environmental management, sulfur dioxide (so₂) emissions—one of the most prominent industrial pollutants—are used as a proxy for environmental pressure and are included as a control variable94; therefore, this study controls it, considering the environmental pollution status, and measures it by the amount of sulfur dioxide emissions.

Table 1 outlines the definitions and calculation methods of all variables.

Benchmark regression analysis

Due to the Hausman test results, with a p-value of 0.000, we choose the fixed effects model to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity. The analysis begins by examining the impact of AI development on energy efficiency (EE), with regression results presented in Table 2. Column (1) reports baseline estimates without control variables, while column (2) introduces controls. Column (3) further refines the model by clustering standard errors at both the city and calendar year levels to mitigate potential intra-group error correlation. The progressive increase in R-squared values across columns (1) through (3) indicates improved model fit with the inclusion of controls and robust error adjustments. In all specifications, the coefficient of AI on EE remains positive (0.049) and statistically significant at the 1% level, providing preliminary evidence that AI development positively influences energy efficiency.

Regarding the control variables, the coefficient on population density is positive and significant at the 1% level, suggesting that higher population density is associated with greater energy efficiency. This may be attributable to the intensified economic activity and more diversified industrial structures typically found in densely populated regions. Additionally, such regions often adopt stricter energy efficiency regulations, incentivizing firms to implement advanced energy-saving technologies. Likewise, the coefficient on per capita GDP is both positive and significant at the 1% level, indicating that higher income levels are linked to enhanced energy efficiency. This relationship likely reflects the increased capacity of wealthier regions to invest in technological innovation and R&D, along with heightened public awareness of environmental sustainability and energy conservation.

In contrast, the coefficients for so₂ emissions and total energy consumption are negative, implying that greater pollutant emissions and energy usage are detrimental to energy efficiency. These findings are consistent with empirical patterns observed in real-world contexts.

Robustness checks

Robustness test

To verify the robustness of these results, the study undertakes three validation approaches. First, it replaces the CCR model-derived measure of energy efficiency with a single-factor energy efficiency (EE) measure81. This shift allows us to assess energy efficiency through a more straightforward metric, calculated as the ratio of energy input to economic output10. Although this approach oversimplifies the multidimensional nature of energy performance, it aligns the analysis with conventional metrics frequently used in existing literature, enabling comparability across studies. As shown in column (1) of Table 3, the positive and significant relationship between AI development and EE persists, lending further credibility to the baseline findings.

Second, a subsample analysis is conducted to account for regional heterogeneity. The cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen—China’s leading megacities—exhibit advanced economic development, robust infrastructure, and strong capabilities in AI innovation, placing them well ahead of cities in central and western China, which face structural and infrastructural limitations. To mitigate potential bias introduced by these outliers, a regression is performed after excluding the four first-tier cities. The results, presented in Column (2) of Table 3, are consistent with those of the full sample, further reinforcing the robustness and generalizability of the core conclusions.

Third, the effects of AI development on energy efficiency may exhibit a time lag due to delays in policy interpretation and implementation. To account for this, we introduce one- and two-period lags of AI development as robustness checks, as shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 3, respectively. The results remain consistent with our baseline findings and provide further empirical support for Hypothesis 1, reaffirming that AI development is positively associated with improvements in urban energy efficiency.

Endogenous processing

To address potential endogeneity, we adopt an instrumental variable (IV) approach. Drawing on established methodologies in the literature, we construct two instruments: (1) a one-period lag of AI development, and (2) a Bartik shift-share instrument. The latter is derived by interacting the lagged first-order AI index with its first-order difference, thereby generating a theoretically grounded IV25,95,96. Table 4 presents the results of the IV regressions, which include the same set of control variables used in the baseline model to mitigate confounding effects. The results demonstrate that AI remains positively and significantly associated with energy efficiency under both IV strategies. Specifically, columns (1) and (3) report the first-stage regression outcomes, confirming a strong correlation between the instruments (IV1 and IV2) and AI. Columns (2) and (4) show the second-stage estimates, where the coefficients on AI are 0.051 and 0.049, respectively, both significant at the 1% level. These findings confirm the robustness and consistency of the main regression results.

Mechanism test

Green technology innovation

Table 5 reports the mediating role of green technological innovation (GTI) in the AI–energy efficiency relationship. Column (1) presents the total effect of AI on energy efficiency, while column (2) shows that AI significantly promotes GTI at the 1% level. This suggests that AI development exerts a substantial and positive influence on the advancement of green technologies, underscoring its capacity to catalyze sustainable innovation. In column (3), when both AI and GTI are regressed on energy efficiency, the coefficient for GTI remains positive and statistically significant at the 5% level. This indicates that GTI contributes to enhancing energy efficiency and functions as a partial mediator. The clustering of AI enterprises appears to foster green innovation, which in turn drives improvements in energy efficiency. These results support Hypothesis 2 regarding the mediating role of GTI.

Rationalization of industrial structure

Table 6 presents the mediating mechanism analysis involving the rationalization of the industrial structure (ISR). Column (1) shows the total effect of AI on energy efficiency, while column (2) reveals that AI significantly promotes ISR at the 1% level, suggesting that AI contributes to industrial upgrading and structural optimization. In column (3), when AI and ISR are jointly regressed on energy efficiency, both variables show positive and statistically significant coefficients at the 1% level. These findings indicate that ISR serves as a significant mediating pathway through which AI enhances energy efficiency. Thus, the results provide empirical support for Hypothesis 3, confirming that AI facilitates energy efficiency improvements by driving the rationalization of the industrial structure.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-09319-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_9319_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-07-06 14:06:58.128809

Regulatory Environment

The regulatory landscape plays a crucial role in Ameren’s operations and future prospects. The company faces a mixed regulatory environment across its two primary markets.

In Missouri, recent developments have been largely positive. Analysts note that solid regulatory progress in the state has been significant enough to offset broader macroeconomic concerns. The passage of Senate Bill 4 (SB 4) has been viewed favorably by management, potentially paving the way for more supportive regulatory conditions.

Conversely, the regulatory environment in Illinois presents ongoing challenges. Analysts have highlighted uncertainties in the state’s regulatory framework as a potential headwind for Ameren. However, the company has made strides in addressing these challenges, with a multi-year rate decision providing investment visibility through 2027.

Growth Strategy and Capital Expenditure

Ameren’s growth strategy centers around a robust capital expenditure plan. The company has outlined a five-year capital plan totaling $26.3 billion, which is expected to drive approximately 9.2% rate base growth CAGR over the 2024-2029 period. This substantial investment is aimed at supporting the company’s targeted 6-8% EPS growth.

A key component of Ameren’s strategy involves leveraging tax credits and transferability provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). These provisions are crucial for maintaining customer bill affordability while pursuing the company’s growth objectives. Management has expressed optimism about maintaining these benefits, although they have also indicated that the loss of approximately $300 million per year in tax credit monetization could be manageable without requiring additional equity issuances.

The company’s involvement in MISO projects presents significant upside potential, with Tranche 2 projects expected to commence in the third quarter of 2025. These projects could provide additional growth opportunities beyond Ameren’s current capital plan.

Ameren’s strong balance sheet, evidenced by its Moody’s Baa1 rating, provides financial flexibility to pursue growth initiatives while maintaining a solid credit profile. This strength, combined with the company’s conservative planning approach, positions Ameren favorably in the eyes of many analysts.

Bear Case

How might regulatory challenges in Illinois impact Ameren’s growth?

Ameren’s operations in Illinois face ongoing regulatory uncertainties that could potentially hinder the company’s growth prospects in the state. The regulatory environment in Illinois has been characterized as challenging, with potential impacts on investment returns and operational flexibility.

If these regulatory challenges persist or intensify, Ameren may face difficulties in implementing its capital expenditure plans or achieving desired rate outcomes in Illinois. This could lead to lower-than-expected returns on investments in the state, potentially dragging down the company’s overall financial performance.

Moreover, regulatory uncertainties could increase the cost of capital for Ameren’s Illinois operations, as investors may demand higher risk premiums. This could impact the company’s ability to fund growth initiatives cost-effectively, potentially limiting its expansion plans in the state.

What risks does Ameren face if IRA tax credits are reduced?

Ameren’s growth strategy relies significantly on tax credits and transferability provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). These provisions are crucial for maintaining customer bill affordability while pursuing the company’s ambitious capital expenditure plans.

If these tax credits were to be reduced or eliminated, Ameren could face significant challenges. The company has indicated that a loss of approximately $300 million per year in tax credit monetization could be manageable without requiring additional equity issuances. However, a more substantial reduction in tax credits could necessitate a reevaluation of Ameren’s capital plans or financing strategy.

A reduction in IRA tax credits could also impact Ameren’s ability to invest in renewable energy projects cost-effectively. This could slow down the company’s transition to cleaner energy sources and potentially affect its competitiveness in an increasingly environmentally conscious market.

Bull Case

How could Ameren’s conservative planning lead to outperformance?

Ameren’s approach to financial planning and growth strategy has been characterized as conservative and executable by analysts. This conservative stance could potentially lead to outperformance in several ways.

Firstly, by setting achievable targets and maintaining a buffer in its projections, Ameren positions itself to potentially exceed market expectations. If economic conditions prove more favorable than anticipated or if the company executes its plans more efficiently than projected, it could result in earnings that surpass current estimates.

Secondly, Ameren’s conservative capital plan leaves room for potential upside. The company has indicated that longer-term spending could increase due to economic development opportunities, particularly in the data center sector. If these opportunities materialize to a greater extent than currently factored into projections, it could drive additional growth beyond current expectations.

Lastly, Ameren’s prudent financial management, evidenced by its strong balance sheet and Moody’s Baa1 rating, provides flexibility to capitalize on unexpected growth opportunities or navigate potential challenges without compromising its financial health.

What potential does the MISO Tranche 2 projects hold for Ameren?

The MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) Tranche 2 projects, set to commence in Q3 2025, represent a significant opportunity for Ameren. These projects could potentially drive growth beyond the company’s current capital plan and market expectations.

MISO projects typically involve large-scale transmission infrastructure investments aimed at improving grid reliability and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources. For Ameren, successful participation in these projects could lead to several benefits:

1. Increased capital deployment opportunities, potentially accelerating rate base growth beyond current projections.

2. Enhanced returns on investment, as transmission projects often come with favorable regulatory treatment.

3. Strengthened market position within the MISO region, potentially leading to future project opportunities.

4. Improved ability to integrate renewable energy sources, aligning with broader decarbonization trends and potentially enhancing Ameren’s environmental profile.

July is peak flash flood season in the US, and central Texas is known as “flash flood alley” because the necessary ingredients of tropical moisture and slow-moving storms come together often over hilly terrain there.
National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters caution that more floods could come this weekend and into next week.
Nearly 14in of rain fell in five hours just west of Austin, Texas – rains that would be expected just once in nearly 1,000 years given a stable climate.
Barry’s circulation pulled record amounts of atmospheric moisture up to central Texas from the near-record warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.","The ongoing challenges of forecasting extreme weather during the era of the climate crisis have been brought to the fore again amid catastrophic flash flooding in the “hill country” region of Texas.

As of early Sunday, hundreds of rescuers are searching for at least 12 people still missing as rains taper off outside of San Antonio and Austin. Hundreds of people have already been pulled from floodwaters that have killed nearly 70 people so far, many of them children at a summer camp along the banks of the Guadalupe River.

July is peak flash flood season in the US, and central Texas is known as “flash flood alley” because the necessary ingredients of tropical moisture and slow-moving storms come together often over hilly terrain there. National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters caution that more floods could come this weekend and into next week.

The scale of this latest climate disaster became apparent on Saturday as drone footage taken on Saturday morning showed entire neighborhoods inundated and rushing waters streaming through small town streets. Tales of survival and heartbreak were plentiful.

An initial analysis of the downpours and the decisions by forecasters that led up to them by the Guardian shows that rainfall of this magnitude was exceedingly rare and difficult to predict, even for this flood-prone region.

Friday’s totals of more than 10in (25cm) of rain in three hours could be expected just once in a “typical” 500-year period for Kerrville, Texas – three months’ worth of rain in just a few hours. Radar data show that more than 4in per hour fell during the peak of Friday’s rains. That rainfall intensity was in excess of a similar flash flood in 1987 that also ended in tragedy for campers along the Guadalupe.

Saturday’s rainfall totals actually exceeded Friday’s rainfall for a region slightly north of Friday’s peak rains. Nearly 14in of rain fell in five hours just west of Austin, Texas – rains that would be expected just once in nearly 1,000 years given a stable climate.

Despite funding cuts and widespread staffing shortages implemented by the Trump administration, NWS forecasters in both the local San Angelo office and at the NWS national specialty center responsible for excessive rainfall provided a series of watches and warnings in the days and hours leading up to Friday’s flooding disaster.

The forecast office in San Angelo has two current vacancies – typical for the pre-Trump era and fewer than the current average staff shortage across the NWS – and has not been experiencing any lapses in weather balloon data collection that have plagued some other offices.

In fact, weather balloon data gathered on Thursday from Del Rio showed record amounts of moisture present in the upper atmosphere above central Texas and added to the confidence that severe flash flooding was possible. The Del Rio office then began issuing a series of flood watches starting on Thursday afternoon that cautioned the region to prepare for “excessive runoff” from “5 to 7 inches of rain”.

The NWS’s Weather Prediction Center, based in College Park, Maryland, also issued a series of mesoscale precipitation discussions on Thursday – highly detailed advance notices to other weather forecasters that a particularly rare event might be underway. In one of the discussions, forecasters noted that moisture content in central Texas was “above the 99th climatological percentile” – far in excess of normal and a clue that historic flooding was possible.

In a final escalation, the NWS office in San Angelo issued a flash flood emergency about an hour before the water started rapidly rising beyond flood stage at the closest US Geological Survey river monitoring gauge. A flash flood emergency is the highest level of flood warning available to the NWS, and sufficient to set off the Wireless Emergency Alert system, which would have triggered cellphone alarms in the region.

The National Weather Service issued dozens of additional flash flood warnings throughout the day on Friday and Saturday after the second wave of extremely heavy rains compounded the flooding’s scope across central Texas during the early morning hours.

Even though watches and warnings were issued on time throughout the disaster – contrasting what local officials have said in press conferences – rainfall totals specified in the first flash flood watch were about half of what ultimately fell.

Current weather forecasting technology is capable of knowing that near-record rainfall may occur somewhere in a given region about a day in advance, but knowing exactly how much and in which part of a specific river’s drainage basin over hilly terrain makes flood forecasting much more difficult – analogous to prediction exactly which neighborhood a tornado might strike a day ahead of time. Donald Trump’s staffing cuts have particularly hit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Environmental Modeling Center, which aims to improve the skill of these types of difficult forecasts.

Though it’s unclear to what extent staffing shortages across the NWS complicated the advance notice that local officials had of an impending flooding disaster, it’s clear that this was a complex, compound tragedy of a type that climate warming is making more frequent.

Rainfall intensity in central Texas has been trending upward for decades, and this week’s rains were enhanced by the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, which made landfall in northern Mexico last week. Barry’s circulation pulled record amounts of atmospheric moisture up to central Texas from the near-record warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/155a65f3df3278e26e360a359ba59c6abc081b64/543_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64b1f4e2007f2f8bab52900bbeb21d65,N,,2025-07-06 14:07:41.495412

In a stunning shift in the automotive landscape, Chinese EV and battery titan BYD is now dominating the market, with sales nearly tripling those of its American rival. As BYD floods global markets with a diverse and affordable lineup, Tesla, grappling with an aging product line and brand turmoil, is pivoting its focus from cars to a high-stakes future of robotaxis and artificial intelligence.

A Tale of Two Fortunes: Sales and Profits Diverge

The numbers tell a stark story. In the second quarter, BYD sold a staggering 1.145 million electric vehicles, a 16% increase year-over-year. Its sales of all-battery electric vehicles (BEVs) alone shot up 45.8% to over 606,000 units, marking the third consecutive quarter that it has handily outsold Tesla.

Meanwhile, Tesla’s deliveries fell 13.5% to 384,122 vehicles in the same period. This trend extends to the bottom line, where the two companies are on opposite trajectories. While Tesla’s Q1 earnings plunged by 40%, BYD’s net income boomed by over 100%, surpassing Tesla’s for the first time—a clear sign of a power shift. This divergence is fueled by Tesla’s reliance on a few aging models versus BYD’s relentless rollout of new vehicles across all price points, from sub-$10,000 city cars to $150,000 luxury models.

Tesla’s Gambit: A Pivot to Autonomy Amidst Crisis

Facing fierce competition and a damaged brand image, partially linked to CEO Elon Musk’s polarizing political activities, Tesla is facing significant headwinds. A critical blow is the new U.S. legislation ending EV tax credits after September 30, which is set to severely impact sales and profitability. The once-lucrative zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) credits, a major profit driver for Tesla, have also been eliminated.

In response, Musk is betting the company’s future not on new cars, but on autonomy. Tesla recently launched a limited, invite-only robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. However, the initial rollout has been modest, operating in a small, heavily mapped area with human “safety monitors” still in the vehicles. An incident involving a minor accident has tempered expectations, suggesting the road to true, unsupervised self-driving is still long. Musk’s other futuristic bets, like the Optimus humanoid robot, have also reportedly faced setbacks and redesigns.

Compounding these challenges is Musk’s renewed political activism, including a feud with President Donald Trump and his vow to form a new “America Party,” which threatens to further alienate customers and invite regulatory scrutiny.

BYD’s Strategy: Relentless Innovation and Global Domination

While Tesla looks to the future, BYD is conquering the present. The Chinese automaker is leveraging its status as a vertically integrated powerhouse—making its own batteries, chips, and components—to wage an aggressive price war, offering discounts up to 34% in its home market.

BYD is also innovating at a blistering pace. It has begun rolling out advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) across its entire lineup at no extra charge and recently unveiled technology that allows its EVs to be fully charged in as little as five minutes.

Crucially, BYD is succeeding where Tesla has struggled: global expansion. With surging overseas sales, new factories planned for Hungary and Turkey to bypass EU tariffs, and plants ramping up in Brazil and Thailand, BYD is cementing its position as a worldwide force. The one market it continues to avoid is the U.S., citing political opposition and high tariffs.

The Road Ahead: A High-Stakes Wager

The contrast between the two EV giants could not be clearer. BYD is executing a classic manufacturing and market-share strategy, overwhelming competitors with volume, variety, and value. Tesla, on the other hand, is asking investors to look past its current struggles and believe in a multitrillion-dollar vision of autonomous vehicles and AI.

While Tesla’s stock (TSLA) still commands a massive $1.02 trillion market cap—largely based on its self-driving promises—it has been a loser in 2025. BYD’s stock (BYDDF), despite a recent dip due to the price war, is up significantly for the year.

The electric vehicle world is now watching a fascinating high-stakes wager: Will Elon Musk’s bet on a robotic future pay off, or will BYD’s relentless focus on building and selling cars today create an insurmountable lead? For now, the crown has slipped, and BYD is firmly in the driver’s seat.",https://www.dailychhattisgarh.com/latest/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stock-23-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 15:04:52.383308

Leadership Risk: Musk's political activities demand time and energy.","The electric vehicle revolution is facing its most significant test yet, and Tesla (TSLA) sits at the epicenter. The company's stock has long been a barometer of investor confidence in the EV transition, but a perfect storm of regulatory headwinds, leadership distraction, and political turmoil now threatens its prospects. As Elon Musk's pivot to politics collides with the loss of federal EV tax credits, the question is no longer whether Tesla can sustain growth—but whether its valuation still makes sense.

Regulatory Headwinds: The Tax Credit Phase-Out and Supply Chain Challenges

The most immediate risk stems from the loss of federal EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Starting in 2023, Tesla began excluding certain models like the Model S and X due to their high price tags exceeding IRS caps ($55,000 for sedans and $80,000 for SUVs/pickups). By 2025, stricter battery sourcing rules—requiring 80% of critical minerals to come from North America—have further limited eligibility.

The impact is clear: Tesla's U.S. sales growth has slowed as buyers lose up to $7,500 in incentives. shows a decline in 2024, with the most affected models being higher-priced vehicles. Analysts estimate that Tesla lost over 10% of potential buyers in key markets due to the credit phase-out, a blow to margins already pressured by rising battery costs.

Leadership Distraction: Musk's Political Pivot

Elon Musk's July 5, 2025, announcement of the America Party—a direct challenge to Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act—has amplified concerns about his focus on Tesla. The feud with Trump, rooted in Musk's opposition to a $3 trillion spending bill, has escalated into personal attacks. Trump has threatened to cut federal subsidies for Tesla and even hinted at legal action, citing Musk's prior role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as leverage.

reveals a decline of nearly 20% in the weeks following the America Party's launch, as investors grew wary of Musk's dual role as tech mogul and political agitator. Analysts at Baird recently downgraded Tesla to “Underperform,” citing “diversion of leadership attention” as a key risk.

Market Sentiment: A Trust Deficit

The fallout isn't just about Musk's time. The political drama has fueled skepticism about Tesla's ability to navigate U.S. regulatory environments. Trump's threats to cut subsidies—whether through reduced tax credits or infrastructure grants—could further squeeze margins. Meanwhile, Musk's alignment with the America Party risks alienating bipartisan support for EVs, a sector that thrives on cross-aisle consensus.

Investor sentiment is also wobbling. Tesla's stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 1.8x, down from 3.5x in 2021, suggesting some re-pricing of risks. But does it go far enough? Musk's political gamble could lead to unintended consequences: foreign investors may retreat, fearing U.S. regulatory overreach, while domestic buyers grow uncertain about Tesla's long-term viability.

The Triple Threat: Can Tesla Survive?

Regulatory Risk: Tesla's reliance on high-margin, high-priced models like the Cybertruck makes it vulnerable to IRA caps. Without tax credits, these vehicles become less competitive against rivals like Ford's F-150 Lightning (still eligible for credits).

Leadership Risk: Musk's political activities demand time and energy. His role in DOGE and now the America Party signals a shift away from operational oversight, raising red flags about Tesla's ability to execute on its $30,000 “Gen 5” car roadmap.

Sentiment Risk: The feud with Trump could trigger legislative pushback, such as stricter emissions rules or subsidies for rival automakers.

Investment Implications: Time to Reassess

Is Tesla's current valuation (around $350 billion as of June 2025) pricing in these risks? Perhaps not fully. While the stock has retreated from all-time highs, the market still assumes Tesla will dominate the EV market indefinitely—a risky bet given the triple threat.

Investors should ask:

- Can Tesla meet the IRA's North American battery sourcing rules by 2029, or will it face penalties?

- How much will Musk's political activities divert focus from Tesla's core business?

- Will the America Party's rise amplify regulatory scrutiny of Musk's other ventures (SpaceX, Neuralink)?

For now, the safest bet is caution. While Tesla remains a leader in EV innovation, its stock is increasingly a play on Musk's ability to juggle CEO and political roles—a high-risk proposition.

shows a growing chorus of downgrades, with just 12% of analysts rating the stock a “Buy.” For investors, this is a signal to reduce exposure or wait for clearer skies.

Stellantis’s financial outlook has come under scrutiny, with analysts projecting significant headwinds in the coming years. While InvestingPro data shows the company maintains profitability with a P/E ratio of 4.61x and pays a substantial 5.74% dividend yield, earnings estimates for 2025 and 2026 have been revised downward, with some analysts forecasting figures 40-45% below consensus.

The North American market, traditionally a stronghold for the company, is expected to face particular challenges. Analysts anticipate a potential €1 billion loss in this region for 2025, contrasting sharply with the consensus expectation of a €1.6 billion profit.

Free Cash Flow (FCF) has emerged as a major concern for investors. InvestingPro data confirms the company is quickly burning through cash, with negative FCF yield at -29%. Analysts project negative FCF of over €3 billion in both 2025 and 2026, following a substantial €6 billion cash burn in the previous year. This trend raises questions about the company’s ability to fund necessary investments and maintain shareholder returns in the near term.

The valuation of Stellantis stock has also come under scrutiny. According to InvestingPro, the stock currently trades at just 4.61 times earnings and 0.3 times book value, suggesting potential undervaluation.

Strategic Challenges and Opportunities

Stellantis faces several strategic challenges, particularly in its North American operations. The company is considered over-capitalized in this region relative to its scale, necessitating a multi-year turnaround effort. Management’s ability to regain scale through pricing strategies or new product introductions is seen as crucial. However, recent product launches have focused on niche segments and are manufactured outside the United States, potentially exposing the company to tariff-related challenges.

The appointment of a new CEO, Antonio Filosa, is viewed as a potential catalyst for change. Analysts expect swift decisions to enhance competitiveness and implement a credible turnaround plan for the North American truck business. Strategic alliances with Chinese OEMs and investments in multi-energy platforms are seen as key growth drivers that could help Stellantis navigate the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and improve its global market position.

North American Market Dynamics

The North American market presents significant challenges for Stellantis. The company is currently operating at approximately 50% capacity utilization in the United States, highlighting the need for operational restructuring. The introduction of 25% US auto tariffs has exacerbated these challenges, disproportionately affecting Stellantis due to its high percentage of imported vehicles sold in the US market.

Analysts estimate that restructuring and reshoring costs for the North American business could reach €4 billion. This substantial investment is seen as necessary to improve competitiveness but will likely impact profitability in the short to medium term. The success of these efforts will be critical in determining Stellantis’s ability to regain market share in a shrinking US automotive market.

Product Portfolio and Brand Strategy

Stellantis’s product portfolio and brand strategy are undergoing significant changes as the company seeks to address market challenges. Recent product launches have focused on niche segments, which may limit the company’s ability to drive volume growth in key markets. Analysts note that many of these new products are manufactured outside the United States, potentially exposing them to tariff-related challenges in the crucial North American market.

The company is in the process of resetting its brands and production capacity, with potential alliances seen as a way to ease capacity cuts. Stellantis aims to leverage its global footprint and cost leadership to improve its competitive position across various market segments. However, the company faces ongoing challenges in rebuilding its asset base and transitioning from internal combustion engine (ICE (NYSE: )) vehicles to EVs.

Operational Efficiency and Cost Management

Stellantis’s management has emphasized cost leadership and operational efficiency as key pillars of its strategy. The company aims to achieve an operating margin range of 6-8% and generate free cash flow of €5-6 billion in the medium term. To reach these targets, Stellantis is focusing on leveraging its global manufacturing footprint and implementing cost-saving measures across its operations.

Analysts highlight the company’s strong capital efficiency and low-cost manufacturing capabilities as potential advantages in a highly competitive industry. However, the success of these initiatives will depend on management’s ability to execute effectively, particularly in the face of ongoing market challenges and the need for significant investments in new technologies.

Global Market Positioning

While Stellantis faces significant challenges in North America, its global market positioning presents both opportunities and risks. The company maintains a strong presence in Europe and has potential for growth in emerging markets. However, analysts warn of long-term risks in regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and South America, where margin normalization may occur due to increasing competition from Chinese OEMs.

Stellantis’s lack of progress in its China strategy and struggles with premium brands are cited as areas of concern that could impact overall performance. The company’s ability to successfully navigate these diverse global markets will be crucial in offsetting challenges in North America and achieving sustainable growth.

Technological Advancements and EV Transition

As the automotive industry undergoes a significant transition towards electrification, Stellantis’s investments in multi-energy platforms and EV technologies are seen as critical for future competitiveness. The company is focusing on building competitive platforms that can support a range of powertrain options, including fully electric vehicles.

However, analysts note that Stellantis faces risks associated with the transition from ICE to EVs, including potential market share loss and the need for substantial capital investments. The company’s ability to execute its technological roadmap effectively while managing costs will be a key factor in determining its long-term success in an increasingly electrified automotive landscape.

Bear Case

How will US auto tariffs impact Stellantis’s profitability?

The implementation of 25% US auto tariffs poses a significant threat to Stellantis’s profitability, particularly in its North American operations. As a company with a high percentage of imported vehicles sold in the US market, Stellantis is disproportionately affected compared to its Detroit-based competitors. These tariffs are expected to severely impact the company’s cost structure, potentially leading to losses in the North American market.

Analysts project that the tariffs could result in a €1 billion loss for Stellantis in North America for 2025, contrasting sharply with the previous consensus expectation of a €1.6 billion profit. This dramatic swing underscores the magnitude of the tariff impact on the company’s financial performance. Furthermore, the additional costs associated with tariffs may force Stellantis to either raise prices, potentially reducing market share, or absorb the costs, further eroding profitability.

The tariff situation also complicates Stellantis’s product strategy. Recent product launches have focused on niche segments and are manufactured outside the US, making them particularly vulnerable to tariff-related challenges. This may limit the company’s ability to introduce competitive new products in the US market, further hampering its efforts to regain market share and improve profitability.

Can Stellantis overcome its structural challenges in North America?

Stellantis faces significant structural challenges in its North American operations that may prove difficult to overcome in the near term. The company is considered over-capitalized in the region relative to its scale, operating at approximately 50% capacity utilization in the United States. This inefficiency contributes to higher fixed costs and reduced profitability.

Addressing these structural issues will require a multi-year turnaround effort, including substantial investments in restructuring and reshoring. Analysts estimate that these costs could reach €4 billion for the North American business alone. Such a significant outlay will likely strain the company’s financial resources and may impact its ability to invest in other critical areas, such as new product development and electrification efforts.

Moreover, Stellantis’s efforts to regain scale through pricing or new product introductions face headwinds in a shrinking US automotive market. The company’s focus on niche segments and products manufactured outside the US may limit its ability to drive volume growth and improve capacity utilization. Without a successful turnaround of its North American truck business and a credible plan to address overcapacity, Stellantis may struggle to achieve sustainable profitability in this crucial market.

Bull Case

How might a new CEO turnaround Stellantis’s performance?

The appointment of Antonio Filosa as Stellantis’s new CEO presents an opportunity for a strategic reset and potential performance turnaround. Analysts anticipate that Filosa will make swift decisions to enhance the company’s competitiveness and implement a credible plan to address challenges, particularly in the North American market.

A new CEO brings fresh perspectives and the potential for bold strategic moves. Filosa may leverage Stellantis’s global footprint and cost leadership to improve operational efficiency and profitability. This could involve rationalizing the brand portfolio, optimizing production capacity, and accelerating the transition to electric vehicles.

Furthermore, the new leadership may pursue strategic alliances, particularly with Chinese OEMs, to strengthen Stellantis’s position in key markets and access new technologies. Such partnerships could help the company navigate the complexities of the EV transition while potentially easing the burden of capacity cuts in certain regions.

If successful, these initiatives could lead to improved financial performance, with the company aiming for an operating margin range of 6-8% and free cash flow of €5-6 billion in the medium term. A well-executed turnaround strategy under new leadership could potentially drive significant value creation for shareholders and position Stellantis more competitively in the global automotive market.

What potential does Stellantis have for growth in emerging markets?

Despite challenges in mature markets, Stellantis maintains significant potential for growth in emerging markets. The company’s global footprint and diverse brand portfolio position it well to capture opportunities in regions with expanding automotive demand.

Stellantis has a strong presence in markets such as the Middle East, Africa, and South America, where rising incomes and increasing motorization rates could drive sales growth. The company’s ability to offer a range of vehicles across different price points and segments allows it to cater to diverse consumer needs in these markets.

Moreover, Stellantis’s cost leadership and experience in producing affordable vehicles could be particularly advantageous in emerging markets, where price sensitivity is often a key factor in purchasing decisions. By leveraging its global scale and manufacturing expertise, the company may be able to introduce competitive products tailored to local preferences and regulations.

However, realizing this growth potential will require careful navigation of increasing competition, particularly from Chinese OEMs. Stellantis will need to balance the opportunities for expansion with the risk of margin normalization as these markets mature. Successfully executing a targeted emerging market strategy could provide a crucial offset to challenges in more established markets and contribute significantly to the company’s overall growth and profitability.

By KEVIN FREKING and LISA MASCARO – Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday signed the tax and spending cut bill Republicans muscled through Congress this week, turning it into law by his own self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.

At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations.

Democrats united against the legislation, but were powerless to stop it as long as Republicans stayed united. The Senate passed the bill Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It passed the final version Thursday 218-214.

Here’s the latest on what’s in the bill and when some of its provisions go into effect.GOP bill includes reductions for businesses and new tax breaks

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump’s first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill, solidifying the tax cuts approved in Trump’s first term.

It temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. There’s also a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year, a nod to his pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It’s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. Proponents say this will boost economic growth.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, and the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House’s version.GOP bill funds the border wall, deportations and a missile shield

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump’s border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.Medicaid, SNAP face deep cuts to fund bill’s tax breaks and spending

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There’s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.

But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.The ‘big beautiful’ bill slashes clean energy tax credits

Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden’s 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs.

Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”

A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.

Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.The bill creates ‘Trump Accounts’ — and funds a national hero garden

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The bill creates a new children’s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There’s a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. The tax is equal to 1% of the transfer.

A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated.

One provision bars for one year Medicaid payments to family planning providers that provide abortions, namely Planned Parenthood.

Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation’s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.State AI regulations cut from bill after a GOP uproar

The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.

A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.

The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.Final price tag: GOP bill could add $3.3 trillion to deficit

Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.",https://i0.wp.com/vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trump-johnson-sign.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-06 15:05:44.868487

Critics of President Donald Trump wasted no time blaming staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) for the widespread death and destruction caused by the floods in Texas, a reaction the White House called ""shameful and disgusting.""

At least 59 people, including 21 children, have been confirmed dead from the flash floods along the Guadalupe River that began Friday. Eleven children and one counselor remain missing from a girls' summer camp near the river, which flooded due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry. That storm made landfall over Mexico, but triggered massive unexpected thunderstorms over parts of Texas.

""It only took 9 days for Trump's cuts to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] to kill dozens of children in Texas when Tropical Storm Barry landed this week,"" Grant Stern, the executive editor of Occupy Democrats, wrote on X.

TEXAS FLOOD SURVIVORS SHARE HARROWING STORIES, SEARCH CONTINUES FOR THOSE STILL MISSING

""The people in Texas voted for government services controlled by Donald Trump and Greg Abbott,"" added Ron Filipkowski, former federal prosecutor and the editor-in-chief of MediasTouchNews. ""That is exactly what they (sic) getting.""

""What has happened to the girls at Camp Mystic is EXACTLY what one of the country's best meteorologists, John Morales, warned would happen,"" added Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director at Christopher Newport University's Wason Center for Public Policy. ""Trump's cuts to the NOAA & NWS have critically impacted storm prediction nationwide.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem held a press conference Saturday, and acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding the nation's flood notification systems, which included concerns that weather forecasts underestimated the amount of rain that ultimately fell.

Noem noted that the Trump administration is ""currently upgrading"" the nation's flood notification technology, which she described as ""ancient.""

""When the [weather] system came over the area, it stalled,"" Noem said during the press conference. ""It was much more water, much like [what] we experienced during [Hurricane] Harvey, with the same type of system that was unpredictable in the way that it reacted in the way that it stopped right here and dumped unprecedented amounts of rain that caused a flooding event like this.""

Tom Fahy, legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, told NBC News that weather forecasting offices were adequately staffed, and ""they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm,"" but he added that unfilled leadership positions were ""clearly a concern.""

""The reason Trump defunded the National Weather Service leading to the deaths of all those girls in the Texas flood is because PROJECT 2025 THOUGHT WEATHER PREDICTION SCIENCE WAS TIED TO EVIDENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE,"" musician Mikel Jollett wrote on X.

WHITE HOUSE INSISTS FEMA IS TAKING HURRICANE SEASON 'SERIOUSLY,' BLASTS 'SLOPPY' REPORTING

Isaiah Martin, a Democratic candidate for Texas's 18th Congressional District, called for an immediate congressional investigation into ""the Republican DOGE cuts to NOAA and the National Weather Service.""

""We saw the affects (sic) this weekend,"" Martin wrote on X. ""Trump defunded these agencies and we DEMAND answers. There MUST be *swift* accountability!""

Washington Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee did not directly blame Trump's approach to climate change for the deaths, but he suggested the president's efforts to peel back green energy funding are a contributing factor to increased catastrophic natural disasters, like this weekend's flood in Texas.

""It is hard to make the Texas flood tragedy worse, except to know that on the same day Trump signed a bill cratering solar and wind energy that is vital in the battle against the climate change making these torrential rains more frequent,"" Inslee wrote on X this weekend.

During an interview with CNN, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, added that he didn't think it was helpful to have open leadership positions that, if filled, could ""help prevent these strategies.""

""I don’t think it’s helpful to have missing key personnel from the National Weather Service not in place to help prevent these tragedies,"" Castro said, adding ""we have to figure out in the future how we make sure that it doesn’t happen again.""

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called it ""shameful and disgusting"" to see that in the wake of this tragedy people are politicizing what took place.

""It’s shameful and disgusting that in the wake of tragedy, the left’s first instinct is to lie and politicize a disaster to target their political opponents. False claims about the NWS have been repeatedly debunked by meteorologists, experts, and other public reporting,"" Jackson said.

And one day soon, those conversations in the barber shop, the local bar and around every kitchen table in New Hampshire will turn into votes at the polls.","Now that Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s ink is dry on the state budget, it’s clear where elected Republican priorities lie. It’s not with working families, community hospitals or our state’s economic future.

At every turn, this budget picks the pockets of Granite Staters who can least afford it, while showering handouts on those who are already well off. It’s a masterclass in upside-down priorities and nowhere is that clearer than in how it treats Medicaid, one of the most vital lifelines for our people and our hospitals.

During floor debate, Republican House Majority Leader Jason Osborne made it painfully clear just how out of touch Republicans are in understanding the impact of this budget. He stood up and said that “people at the barber shop or the grocery store aren’t asking about Medicaid reimbursement rates.” It was an elitist dismissal of the reality that working people do think about what keeps their local hospitals open, their health insurance active and the ways this budget harms them with health care costs that drain their paychecks.

The truth is, they’re thinking about it every single day because it hits them directly. When a hospital can’t afford to pay its nurses or keep a wing open because the state refuses to raise reimbursement rates, that means the emergency room wait time your family faces after an accident gets longer. When a mental health provider closes its doors, a child, a parent or a neighbor goes without care. And when nursing homes can’t keep up with real costs, families are forced to scramble to find a bed for an aging loved one or be faced with providing that care themselves.

It’s the same everyday people sitting in that barber chair who will feel the squeeze of this budget’s new taxes and punishing work requirements on Medicaid. These so-called “reforms” don’t save money, they just add paperwork and bureaucratic barriers that push people off coverage altogether.

The premiums are, plain and simple, an income tax on the Granite Staters who can least afford it. When family members are forced to skip a prescription, cancel their child’s doctor visit because they can’t pay or choose between paying for healthcare or groceries, you can bet that’s exactly what folks will be talking about. Not just at the barber shop, but at every grocery store and around every kitchen table in this state.

So, who benefits here?

Look no further than the “universal” school voucher scheme, a fiscal black hole already growing out of control. Just weeks after the governor signed the enabling bill into law, over 2,000 new applications have poured in from families whose kids were already in private schools. That means taxpayer money is being handed to private institutions that never received state funding before and still aren’t subject to taxpayer oversight.

And the kicker? This budget only funds 7,500 students, but the law allows for 10,000. We’re setting up local taxpayers to pick up the bill for the inevitable shortfall.

Meanwhile, our real economic engines go neglected. The University System, one of our greatest tools for keeping young people here and building the workforce we need, remains chronically underfunded. Housing, the biggest barrier for working families and businesses trying to attract workers, gets lip service but no serious solutions. And clean energy, an industry that should be powering jobs and lowering bills, takes a hit, too. This budget raids the Renewable Energy Fund and sets us up for the sunset of net metering in 2040, pushing solar developers and the good-paying jobs they bring out of state.

This budget is not fiscally conservative—it’s fiscally reckless. It trades away long-term stability for short-term giveaways that weaken our hospitals, shortchange our kids and hit working families in the wallet.

So, the next time the Republican Majority Leader Rep. Jason Osborne wants to act like working people don’t care about the Medicaid rates that keep their hospitals open, excessive costs for housing or the premiums and fees that drain their paychecks, he should spend a little more time in that barber shop. Because the folks in that chair are talking about it, and they know exactly who this budget works for and who it leaves behind.

And one day soon, those conversations in the barber shop, the local bar and around every kitchen table in New Hampshire will turn into votes at the polls.

New Hampshire deserves better than this upside-down budget, and Granite Staters are ready to stand up and demand it.

That comes as President Donald Trump signed into law his huge tax-and-spending bill, which eliminates key tax credits for the electric vehicle giant. Also over the weekend, a Tesla robotaxi brushed a parked car.

Musk announced Saturday on his social site X that he is forming the ""America Party"" after polling his followers. ""When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,"" he wrote. ""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""

Musk says the America party will focus on ""just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 house districts.""

Musk doubling down on politics, after recently vowing to step back, is not what Tesla bulls want to hear, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

""Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,"" Ives wrote in a Sunday note. ""While the core Musk supporters will back Musk at every turn no matter what, there is broader sense of exhaustion from many Tesla investors that Musk keeps heading down the political track.""

Musk risks alienating Trump supporters after turning off Tesla's core customers in the U.S. and Europe with strong Trump support in 2024, his DOGE work earlier this year and various political statements over the past year or two.

The newly signed legislation ends the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit after Sept. 30. Tesla will likely see a big jump in U.S. sales in the third quarter, pulling forward demand before the tax credits expire. But after that U.S. sales will likely tumble.

Meanwhile, the Trump budget immediately scrapped highly profitable zero emission credits in the U.S. Other automakers would buy ZEV credits from Tesla to meet emission standards.

In the first quarter, Tesla would have had an operating loss without its ZEV credits. Tesla will still get emission credits in Europe and China, but its plunging European sales and sliding China demand will hit those revenue sources.

Meanwhile, Trump tariffs have sharply raised the cost of imported Chinese batteries for Tesla Energy.

Trump had campaigned on these issues, so these policies aren't really a surprise.

Futures Due With Trump Tariffs, Tesla Stock In Focus

Tesla Robotaxi

Most Tesla robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, have gone smoothly. But, even with human supervision, there have been a few incidents, including a robotaxi recently brushing a stationary Toyota Camry while trying to park.

Tesla bulls hail the effort as vindication. But the EV giant likely will need to remove the safety monitors and significantly expand the number of robotaxis and where they operate before convincing many others.

Since the limited robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, on June 22, Tesla stock is down 2.1%. Clearly a number of headlines beyond robotaxis are swirling around TSLA stock, including better-than-feared Q2 deliveries. But Uber Technologies (UBER), seen as an inverse play to Tesla's robotaxi efforts, has rallied 11.8% to 93.63 since June 22. Uber stock cleared an early entry on June 24 and just broke out Thursday from a flat base. Mobileye (MBLY) has shot up 29.6%, with the driver-assist systems maker clearing an early entry.

More broadly, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up 5.2% and 5.9%, respectively, over that span, both hitting record highs.

Tesla Stock: What Next?

Tesla stock fell 2.6% to 315.35 last week, just between the 200-day and 50-day lines. Shares could be close to forging a new base.

But Musk's political move may have a big impact on Tesla stock. Shares rallied from late April to late May in part because Musk said he was backing away from politics and the Trump administration. TSLA tumbled on the Musk-Trump feud, rebounded as they defused tensions, then skidded again as Musk and Trump renewed their war of words.

The July 1 low of 293.21 is a short-term level to watch. So is the June 5 low of 273.21.

Investors will get an early read on TSLA stock around 8 p.m. ET, via trades on Robinhood, Charles Schwab and Interactive Brokers. Nasdaq early trading will begin around 5 a.m. ET on Monday. But Tesla is prone to big overnight moves that wane or reverse during regular trading.

(NASDAQ: ), a leading global provider of energy storage products and services, is navigating a complex landscape of regulatory challenges, market pressures, and strategic opportunities. With a market capitalization of $1.1 billion and a beta of 2.65, the stock has shown significant volatility, returning nearly 37% in the past week despite a challenging year-to-date decline of 47%. As the company positions itself in the rapidly evolving clean energy sector, investors and analysts are closely monitoring its performance and future prospects.

According to InvestingPro, FLNC currently holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, though it’s been rapidly burning through cash reserves. These insights are just 2 of over 15 exclusive ProTips available to subscribers, helping investors make more informed decisions about this volatile clean energy stock.

Market Position and Recent Performance

Fluence Energy has established itself as a significant player in the energy storage market, with a strong presence in North America and expanding operations in EMEA and APAC regions. The company’s market capitalization stood at approximately $1.27 billion as of July 2025, reflecting its substantial footprint in the industry.

However, recent financial results have been mixed. The company reported disappointing results for the first quarter of 2025, leading to short-term weakness in the stock. Analysts have noted that the fiscal year 2025 is expected to be heavily backweighted, with a 20/80 split between first half and second half revenues. This uneven distribution has contributed to investor uncertainty regarding revenue outlooks.

Despite these challenges, Fluence Energy maintains a solid position in the market. The company benefits from a first-mover advantage in domestic sourcing, which could potentially lead to pricing and margin premiums. Additionally, the secular increase in demand for battery storage, driven by declining prices and the need for grid reliability, provides a favorable backdrop for Fluence’s operations.

Regulatory Environment and Tariff Impact

The regulatory landscape has become increasingly complex for Fluence Energy, with several factors influencing the company’s operations and financial outlook. Recent financial data from InvestingPro shows the company struggling with weak gross profit margins of 13.07% and negative EBITDA of -$11.63 million in the last twelve months. These challenges underscore the importance of regulatory developments for the company’s future profitability. One of the most significant developments has been the initiation of Anti-Dumping/Countervailing Duty (AD/CVD) investigations on anode grade graphite material imported from China by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The complaint alleges dumping margins ranging from 823% to 916%, which could have substantial implications for Fluence’s supply chain and cost structure.

Analysts estimate that the cost of goods sold (COGS) for energy storage system (ESS) battery systems is only about 3% of the graphite cost. This suggests that every 25% tariff could potentially create a 60 basis point headwind to Fluence’s margins. However, the company may have opportunities to pass on or share these costs to help offset and mitigate the margin impact.

The tariff situation remains fluid, with potential changes in policy under different administrations adding to the uncertainty. Some analysts speculate that increased tariffs on Chinese cells could make Fluence’s domestically produced cells more cost-competitive, potentially benefiting the company in the long run.

Strategic Initiatives and Future Outlook

In response to the challenging regulatory environment and market pressures, Fluence Energy has undertaken several strategic initiatives to strengthen its competitive position. One of the most notable moves has been the company’s focus on securing domestic U.S. cell production for energy storage. This strategy anticipates potential policy changes that could favor domestically produced components.

To support these initiatives, Fluence recently raised approximately $400 million through convertible securities, bolstering its financial position. This capital infusion provides the company with a buffer against market uncertainty and supports its investments in domestic manufacturing capabilities.

The company’s strategic pivot towards U.S.-made cells could prove advantageous, particularly if stricter domestic content requirements are implemented for tax credits related to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Analysts view this bet on domestic production as a smart move that could lead to significant gains in U.S. market share.

Financial Analysis and Projections

Fluence Energy’s financial projections reflect both the challenges and opportunities facing the company. Earnings per share (EPS) estimates for the fiscal year 2025 range from $0.38 to $0.70, with projections for fiscal year 2026 ranging from $0.93 to $1.66. These estimates suggest expectations of significant profitability improvements over the coming years.

However, some analysts have revised their EBITDA projections downward, showing a reduction of 20-30% through fiscal year 2028 due to anticipated margin compression. This compression is largely attributed to ongoing price deflation in the energy storage systems market, driven by competitive pressures from Chinese suppliers.

Revenue projections remain robust, with estimates for fiscal year 2025 ranging from $2.7 billion to $4.1 billion, and fiscal year 2026 projections reaching as high as $5.2 billion. Current revenue stands at $2.33 billion, with InvestingPro’s Fair Value analysis suggesting the stock is slightly undervalued at current levels. These figures underscore the expected growth in the energy storage market, despite the competitive and regulatory challenges.

Bear Case

How might ongoing tariff uncertainties impact FLNC’s competitiveness?

The complex tariff environment poses a significant risk to Fluence Energy’s operations and financial performance. The potential implementation of high tariffs on Chinese imports could disrupt the company’s supply chain and increase costs. While Fluence has been proactive in securing domestic production capabilities, the transition period could be challenging and potentially costly.

If tariffs are implemented unevenly or unpredictably, it could create a volatile pricing environment where Fluence struggles to maintain consistent margins. Competitors with more diversified supply chains or those less reliant on Chinese components might gain an advantage, potentially eroding Fluence’s market share.

Moreover, if the tariffs lead to retaliatory measures from China or other countries, it could impact Fluence’s international operations and growth prospects in key markets like EMEA and APAC. This geopolitical uncertainty adds another layer of complexity to the company’s strategic planning and risk management.

What risks does FLNC face from increasing competition in the energy storage market?

As the energy storage market continues to grow rapidly, Fluence Energy faces intensifying competition from both established players and new entrants. Chinese suppliers, in particular, have been exerting significant pricing pressure, leading to ongoing price deflation in the energy storage systems market.

This competitive landscape poses several risks for Fluence. First, the company may struggle to maintain its pricing power, potentially leading to margin erosion even as revenues grow. Second, competitors may innovate more quickly or offer more attractive product features, challenging Fluence’s technological edge.

Additionally, as more companies enter the market, there’s a risk of commoditization in certain segments of the energy storage industry. This could make it harder for Fluence to differentiate its offerings and maintain premium pricing, further pressuring margins and profitability.

Bull Case

How could FLNC benefit from stricter domestic content requirements?

Stricter domestic content requirements, particularly those related to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), could significantly benefit Fluence Energy. The company’s strategic decision to invest in domestic U.S. cell production positions it well to capitalize on such policy changes.

If new regulations favor domestically produced components, Fluence could see increased demand for its products as customers seek to qualify for tax credits and other incentives. This could lead to a larger market share in the U.S. and potentially higher margins as the company’s domestic production becomes more cost-competitive relative to imported alternatives.

Furthermore, stricter domestic content rules could create barriers to entry for foreign competitors, particularly those heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing. This could give Fluence a significant advantage in the U.S. market, allowing it to solidify its position as a leading provider of energy storage solutions.

What potential does FLNC have for margin improvement through vertical integration?

Fluence Energy’s investments in domestic production capabilities open up opportunities for vertical integration, which could lead to significant margin improvements. By controlling more of its supply chain, the company can potentially reduce costs, improve quality control, and increase operational efficiency.

Vertical integration could allow Fluence to better manage inventory, reduce lead times, and respond more quickly to market demands. This increased agility could be particularly valuable in a rapidly evolving industry like energy storage.

Moreover, by developing proprietary technologies and manufacturing processes, Fluence could create unique value propositions that differentiate its products from competitors. This could lead to premium pricing and higher margins, especially if the company can demonstrate superior performance or reliability.

As Fluence gains more experience with its vertically integrated operations, it may also identify new opportunities for innovation and cost reduction, further enhancing its competitive position and financial performance.

WRI does not participate in litigation or direct legal actions by others,” World Resources Institute spokesperson Allison Cinnamond told The Daily Signal.
“Any assertion to the contrary is false.” The California-China Climate Institute Former California Gov.","China-linked entities have their fingerprints on climate lobbying and lawsuits in the U.S., causing alarm among some lawmakers and watchdog organizations.

“I don’t know the intentions. But whatever the intentions, policy after policy demonstrably strengthens China and weakens the United States,” Scott Walter, president of the investigative think tank Capital Research Center, told The Daily Signal of the green policies pushed by environmental groups that work with or receive funding from China.

“The most obvious is forcing green energy and subsidies [for green energy]. China overwhelmingly procures the outputs,” Walter continued. “We are literally subsidizing China’s industry. Americans don’t want electric vehicles and electric stove mandates. And who makes most of the parts for these electric appliances? It’s not the U.S. It’s China.”

Though China is one of the world’s biggest polluters, it is also the largest supplier of green energy products. China supplies 78% of the world’s solar cells, 80% of the world’s lithium-ion battery chemicals, and 73% of the world’s finished battery cells, according to Just Facts, a research organization.

But U.S.-based environmental organizations contend their partnerships with these entities make sense because global climate change problems can’t be addressed without working with organizations in China because of the impact of its massive carbon emissions on the rest of the world. Further, the groups stress that China-linked dollars used to fund these organizations are not used to affect U.S. policy.

“We work in China for one reason: There’s not a single global environmental problem that the world can confront unless China is part of the fix,” Natural Resources Defense Council spokesperson Josh Mogerman told The Daily Signal in a statement.

Push for Transparency

On June 25, a Senate subcommittee held a hearing titled “Enter the Dragon—China and the Left’s Lawfare Against American Energy Dominance.” Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, a Republican, was a witness at the hearing.

In an interview with The Daily Signal, Kobach noted that an organization called the Chinese-American Planning Council lobbied the state of New York to pass the Climate Change Superfund Act to impose retroactive fines on fossil fuel producers. This led to 22 states—including Kansas—to sue New York state over the act and its fines. Plaintiffs argue the superfund would raise energy prices nationally.

“China’s involvement was crystal clear in lobbying for the superfund law in New York,” Kobach told The Daily Signal. “We don’t have a clear picture of who is funding the county and local lawsuits against fossil fuel companies. But China has such a huge interest, it stands to reason they are probably also engaged in state and local litigation.”

A spokesperson for the New York-based Chinese-American Planning Council, which was established in 1965, did not respond to phone and email inquiries for this story this week or last week. The group’s website shows it has advocated for the superfund law.

Two bills in Congress would require more transparency regarding who is paying for the lawsuits.

Rep. Ben Cline, R-Va., introduced the Protecting Our Courts From Foreign Manipulation Act. Cline’s bill would require the Justice Department’s National Security Division to report on foreign funding in federal litigation. The legislation would also require any foreign person or entity to disclose if it is a third-party funder of a civil lawsuit in federal court.

“In recent years, foreign adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party have grown bolder in their efforts to infiltrate and manipulate America’s legal system,” Cline told The Daily Signal in a statement. “Through third-party litigation funding, these actors aim to influence legal outcomes in ways that serve their political interests and threaten our national security.”

Cline added, “We must not allow the CCP or any foreign entity to undermine our legal institutions or the rule of law in the United States.”

A bipartisan version of the Cline bill was introduced in the Senate in 2023.

Meanwhile, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., was the lead sponsor earlier this year of the Litigation Transparency Act of 2025, which would require the disclosure of those parties getting payments in civil lawsuits and the disclosure of the financing agreement between investors in and parties to these civil actions.

Climate Collaboration Backed by China

A big funder of U.S. climate groups has been the Energy Foundation China, based in San Francisco.

The foundation’s president and CEO is Ji Zou, a former deputy director general of China’s National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, which is part of the Chinese government’s National Development and Reform Commission, according to the organization.

Zou was also a member of the Chinese climate negotiation team leading up to the Paris Agreement, a multilateral climate deal which the Obama administration entered with China in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions.

David Vance Wagner is the Energy Foundation China vice president for strategic development. He was previously a China counsellor in the Office of the Special Envoy for Climate Change at the State Department, and helped lead U.S.-China collaboration on climate, according to the Energy Foundation China.

“Energy Foundation China (EFC) is an independent grantmaking charitable organization that provides funding for research and capacity building related to climate change and China,” Wagner told Fox News last month amid criticism of the organization. He added, “All grants we make support projects related to climate change and China, and are in no way related to influencing U.S. energy policy. EFC does not accept funding from any government or political party.”

Wagner went on to say: “Neither the Chinese government nor the CCP fund, direct, or control EFC or our grant-making decisions. We are compliant with all U.S. and Chinese laws and regulations and do not lobby or support electoral activities in any country.”

The Energy Foundation China did not respond to multiple email inquiries for this story last week and this week. The group’s website says over the past 25 years, it funded more than 4,000 projects, with total of more than $500 million.

“Our work is currently focused on China given the scale of its energy sector and its role in global emissions,” the website says. It adds, “Despite geopolitical tensions, meaningful engagement in China on climate change, emissions reductions, and supporting the clean energy transition is in everyone’s interests.”

The coordinated campaign of pushing so-called green policies and green litigation in the United States is the strategic alliance of “leftist billionaires, radical environmental organizations, and the Chinese Communist Party,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said at the hearing last week of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Federal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights.

“One of the primary vehicles for this alliance is Energy Foundation China, which has funneled upwards of $12 million to U.S.-based climate advocacy groups,” Cruz said. “This money isn’t going to tree-planting campaigns or to science fairs. It’s flowing directly to aggressive litigation outfits like the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Rocky Mountain Institute, and the World Resources Institute—organizations that routinely file lawsuits trying to block [oil and gas] pipelines.”

The World Resources Institute denied any role in litigation.

“World Resources Institute is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that produces data-driven research. WRI does not participate in litigation or direct legal actions by others,” World Resources Institute spokesperson Allison Cinnamond told The Daily Signal.

In 2017, the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental think tank, issued a report along with the Chinese government’s National Development and Reform Commission and other organizations. According to the report, the goal was to reach “a common factbase for how China could use energy efficiency and renewable energy to meet the growing demand of its population for a clean, low-carbon, efficient, safe, reliable, and cost-effective modern energy system.”

The RMI does not engage in litigation, a spokesperson noted. Further, all of the Energy Foundation China funding that it has received has been focused on tackling pollution in China, not shaping U.S. policy, the spokesperson said.

“All of RMI’s work supported by Energy Foundation China, which is a U.S.-based charitable organization, is focused squarely on the energy transition inside of China,” Rocky Mountain Institute spokesperson Dina Cappiello told The Daily Signal. “It is factually inaccurate to state or imply that any of these funds were related to our U.S.-based work.”

The Rocky Mountain Institute works in China for a straightforward reason, she said. “RMI works in China because it is the world’s single largest source of energy demand and the world’s largest emitter of heat-trapping pollution, accounting for roughly a third of each.”

“Solving energy resource issues cannot happen without engaging China, nor can solutions solely depend on China,” Capiello continued. “RMI has shared its independent research and analysis with governments all over the world, including the U.S., China, India, and many others; diverse policymakers; corporations; and researchers and fellow nongovernmental entities, in order to accelerate the adoption of market-based solutions for efficient, affordable, resilient, and clean energy.”

The Natural Resources Defense Council also denies using China-linked resources to shape U.S. policy.

“When developing our institutional positions—in the United States, India, China, or anywhere else in the world—we rely on our U.S.-based senior leadership and board of independent trustees, and no one else. We do the bidding of no government, in this country or any other,” said Mogerman, the spokesperson for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“NRDC does not take money from the Chinese government. NRDC used grant funding from the Energy Foundation China exclusively for work to help China cut pollution, not for U.S. advocacy or litigation,” Mogerman said. “Any assertion to the contrary is false.”

The California-China Climate Institute

Former California Gov. Jerry Brown launched the Californian China-Climate Institute at the University of California, Berkeley in 2019. The California-based institute partners with the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at China’s Tsinghua University, according to the Capital Research Center. That is the same Chinese university where hackers probed U.S. companies and government offices for espionage purposes in 2018, Reuters reported.

“The [California-China Climate Institute] was established to study and recommend actions to reverse catastrophic global warming, which can only be done if China—the world’s largest climate polluter—does its part,” an institute spokesperson told The Daily Signal in a statement.

The California institute is affiliated with both the University of California Berkeley School of Law and the Rausser College of Natural Resources.

The spokesperson for the institute dismissed testimony from the Senate hearing about Chinese money backing U.S. environmental groups, and said the California-China Climate Institute “does not lobby or litigate.”",https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250702_China-Enviros-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 12:20:06.881567

Faster charging and dependable power systems affect everything from emergency response to aviation.","Ampcera didn't just put out another new product. As CEO Sumin Zhu, Ph.D, put it, ""It's a shift."" One that may change how devices like your phone and electric car hold their charge.

Interesting Engineering reports that this U.S.-based company has begun commercial shipments of its nano-sulfide solid electrolyte powders. This may sound like a new energy sports drink, and it sort of is — but for your devices.

These powders don't splash around like battery liquid; they allow energy to flow through solids. In other words, the battery can run cooler, charge faster, and last a lot longer.

""A pivotal commercial milestone,"" Zhu said, per Interesting Engineering.

Ampcera itself reassured that the new materials offer ""enhanced safety with 50% more energy compared to current lithium-ion batteries.""

This isn't lab theory. Orders are in. Over 200 customers are already using the new materials in tests.

Most solid-state batteries still rely on liquids that can overheat or break down.

This new material changes that. According to Interesting Engineering, Ampcera claims that its solid-state cells achieve an energy density of 400 Wh/kg and retain 80% of their capacity after fast charging. That's like charging your phone before dinner and still having battery left the next week.

Fewer failures also mean fewer rare materials wasted. That cuts down on mining and reduces air and water pollution from material processing.

""Enhanced safety with 50% more energy"" isn't just a promise — it's already in use. A more stable battery design reduces the likelihood of thermal runaway — the kind of failure that leads to overheating or worse. For people in dense cities or sensitive environments, that reliability could mean fewer safety issues, lower insurance costs, and peace of mind.

It could also reshape how we power future tech. Think grid storage, electric delivery trucks, and even military-grade gear. Faster charging and dependable power systems affect everything from emergency response to aviation.

If supply chains cooperate, these next-gen batteries could start showing up within two years. Not splashy, but it's the kind of upgrade, along with smart green tech like solar panels, that quietly makes things safer, faster, and cleaner to use.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EV-charging-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 14:07:57.907156

In 2023, the climate tech start-up Seabound partnered with Lomarlabs, a subsidiary of UK-based shipowner Lomar Shipping, to trial a new technology that it hoped would capture carbon emissions to help decarbonise its shipping activities.
They developed a prototype that helped them raise $4 million in funding from investors who were looking for a way to decarbonise shipping.
During pilot projects, Seabound was able to improve the rate of emissions capture to 78 percent carbon capture efficiency and over 90 percent sulphur capture.
This means shipping companies can manage the level of carbon capture during a ship’s journey by purchasing and using more or fewer quicklime containers.","The race is on to decarbonise shipping, a hard-to-abate industry in which it is extremely difficult to cut emissions. Over 50,000 cargo ships are at sea at any moment, and these ships produce around 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which is even more than aviation, showing the dire need to clean up the industry. The long-term focus is on developing sustainable fuels, hydrogen fuel cells, or batteries big enough to power these giant vessels. However, one company believes it may have a short-term solution for reducing emissions as it rolls out its carbon-capture technology on board ships.

In 2023, the climate tech start-up Seabound partnered with Lomarlabs, a subsidiary of UK-based shipowner Lomar Shipping, to trial a new technology that it hoped would capture carbon emissions to help decarbonise its shipping activities. The pilot project was part of the U.K. Department for Transport’s 2022 Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition Round 3, which allocated $82 million to 19 flagship projects.

Seabound’s compact carbon capture device can be retrofitted into a ship’s engine exhaust at the funnel, giving it the potential to be used on a wide range of preexisting vessels. The technology takes up little space on board but can make a big difference. Carbon dioxide, which comes from the diesel that is burnt to power the vessel, chemically reacts with little calcium oxide (quicklime) pebbles, which are used to convert the CO2 into calcium carbonate, or limestone, to lock it in and stop it being released into the atmosphere. The pebbles can be stored easily on the ship until it returns to port, where the limestone is offloaded to be sold in its pure form or to be reseparated into quicklime and CO2 for the quicklime to be reused on other vessels.

Co-founders Alisha Fredriksson and Roujia Wen took the idea from the quicklime-based carbon-capture technology often used at industrial plants. They developed a prototype that helped them raise $4 million in funding from investors who were looking for a way to decarbonise shipping.

During pilot projects, Seabound was able to improve the rate of emissions capture to 78 percent carbon capture efficiency and over 90 percent sulphur capture. The team hoped to improve this to up to 95 percent emission capture. Seabound’s prototype captured around one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions a day during the test.

In 2025, the project is still advancing. Since the initial tests, Seabound has advanced its prototypes and tested its technology in Turkish shipyards, on the deck of a 3,200-container ship, and a three-week trip down the Suez Canal. The company’s new prototype is being developed to the dimensions of a standard 20-foot shipping container, meaning that it will be able to slot in with the cargo on deck.

Several containers with quicklime will be stacked alongside regular cargo so that the ship can incrementally increase carbon capture as the journey progresses, as containers holding limestone can be traded out for containers of fresh quicklime. This means shipping companies can manage the level of carbon capture during a ship’s journey by purchasing and using more or fewer quicklime containers.

To make the project even cleaner, companies are working on producing quicklime using kilns heated with renewable energy or incorporating carbon capture technology into manufacturing operations. Seabound hopes to source this green quicklime for future projects to make its operations more sustainable.

However, some environmental groups are concerned that incorporating carbon capture technology into vessels could deter the maritime sector from investing in long-term decarbonisation options. Blánaid Sheeran at Opportunity Green said, “The potential for short-term use of carbon-capture retrofits on existing vessels should not become a justification to extend the lifespan of fossil fuels or delay the shift to truly sustainable alternatives.”

However, Fredriksson and Wen believe that their technology can be used in the mid-term, while governments increase shipping regulations and invest in long-term decarbonisation technologies. As stricter regulations on maritime emissions are introduced, the founders plan to roll out more containers to help decarbonise.

The next challenge for Seabourne is to scale up operations. Each of the company’s quicklime units is priced at tens of thousands of pounds. Nevertheless, Fredriksson and Wen believe the units are cost-effective, and they are seeing increasing interest from shipping companies that are looking to decarbonise. The founders hope their technology will eventually be used on thousands of ships all over the world.

While innovative carbon capture technology cannot be used as a preventative method for carbon emissions, it may be useful in helping prevent large quantities of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere as a mid-term solution. Meanwhile, governments must introduce stricter regulations on the maritime sector and shipping companies should invest in research and development into sustainable fuels and other long-term solutions.

With a focus on housing, transport, and green innovation, the region is emerging as a compelling investment destination. Here's why investors should take note.

Infrastructure Boom: Housing and Transport as Growth Catalysts

The cornerstone of Barrow's revival is its ambitious infrastructure overhaul. Over 12,000 new homes—including 800 units in the Marina Village mixed-use development—will cater to a growing population and attract young professionals. Higher-density housing in the town center aims to reverse depopulation trends, while upgrades to the A590/A595 road network and Furness rail line will boost connectivity for both residents and freight logistics.

BAE Systems, Barrow's anchor employer with over 14,500 jobs, exemplifies the region's strategic importance to UK defense. Its stock's resilience reflects the sector's stability, but the real opportunity lies in the plan's diversification beyond traditional industries.

Green Energy: A Strategic Edge for Investors

Barrow's pivot to clean energy is its most compelling investment angle. The GRAMM consortium's proposed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) project—targeting up to 850 new jobs by 2035—aligns with UK net-zero goals. Meanwhile, offshore wind and carbon capture projects will anchor a green economy.

The region's existing maritime expertise positions it to dominate emerging sectors like offshore wind installation and hydrogen production. Investors should monitor companies like Ørsted (ORSTED.C), pioneers in offshore wind, and local firms bidding for Barrow's green contracts.

Job Creation: A Diversified Pipeline

The plan's success hinges on its 360-degree job strategy:

- Defense: 14,500+ existing roles, with submarine programs securing long-term employment.

- Clean Energy: 850+ jobs from SAF alone, plus roles in wind and carbon capture.

- Education: A new University of Cumbria campus (2025) offering engineering and nursing degrees will train a locally rooted workforce.

- Logistics: Improved transport networks will attract warehousing and distribution hubs.

By 2035, Barrow aims to reduce economic inactivity below the national average, with workforce qualifications (RQF 4+) rising significantly.

Public-Private Synergy: A Blueprint for Success

The Team Barrow partnership—uniting government, BAE Systems, and local authorities—ensures coordinated investment. Key collaborations include:

- The £970k Barrow Transformation Fund, developing outline plans for mixed-use town center projects.

- The Brilliant Futures Fund (£5M) and Social Impact Fund (£650k+ distributed), boosting education and community resilience.

These partnerships reduce risk for private investors, as public funding de-risks early-stage projects like the SAF plant or rail upgrades.

Demographic Upside: A Growing Population, Rising Demand

With 12,000 new homes, Barrow's population is set to expand by ~20% over a decade. This growth will fuel demand for retail, healthcare, and leisure—sectors ripe for investment. The town center's planned cultural amenities (e.g., theaters, event spaces) will further attract visitors and talent.

Investment Playbook: How to Capitalize

Real Estate: Back developers building Marina Village or town-center mixed-use projects. Look for firms with strong local ties.

Green Energy: Invest in companies bidding for Barrow's renewable projects or partnering with GRAMM.

Logistics: Target firms benefiting from A590/A595 upgrades or Furness rail efficiency gains.

Education & Skills: Support the University of Cumbria's Innovation Hub or apprenticeship programs aligned with local industry needs.

Final Take: A Decade of Opportunity

Barrow's 10-year plan is not just about infrastructure—it's a strategic rebalancing of the UK economy. By 2035, the region could rival Scotland's renewables hubs or the Thames Estuary's logistics corridors. Early investors in Barrow's housing, green energy, and logistics sectors stand to benefit from a virtuous cycle of job growth, rising property values, and diversified tax revenues.

Throughout the conference, a common theme emerged: progress is still possible, but only with shared responsibility across public and private sectors.
The conference concluded with a unified call to scale up ambition, reduce policy fragmentation and strengthen cross-border cooperation.","The International Finance Forum (IFF), in partnership with the Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe and the American Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, have co-hosted a high-level conference under the theme of “Overcoming New Hurdles in Firms’ Fight Against Global Warming.” The event brought together leading voices from international organizations, government and industry to discuss emerging challenges and solutions in the global climate agenda.

Against the backdrop of mounting geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, the conference emphasized the need for renewed commitment and bold policy actions to preserve momentum in combating climate change. While the climate agenda has experienced setbacks in recent years, participants agreed that businesses are continuing to press forward, translating climate ambition into action, investment and innovation.

Edmond Alphandéry, Chairman of the Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe, warned of growing inertia in climate policymaking, commenting: “We need to get the climate control race back on track. Political and financial forces are slowing us down, and this is deeply concerning. The temperature trends globally are alarming, and the consequences of inaction are irreversible.”

Zhu Xian, IFF Executive VP and former VP of the World Bank, echoed those concerns: “After several years of steady progress in advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, a series of obstacles now threatens to halt, and even reverse, our gains. Yet, across the world, companies remain committed to their duty to protect our planet for future generations.”

Durwood Zaelke, Founder and President of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, stressed the importance of both science and communication in addressing the climate emergency, adding: “The climate crisis is defined by three factors: temperature, time and tipping points. We are already at 1.5°C of warming, and the path we are on could exceed 2°C within a decade. Irreversible tipping points like the collapse of Atlantic ocean currents demand immediate, coordinated solutions.”

The high-level conference explored how firms are scaling up renewable energy projects amid infrastructure and policy challenges.

Marta Martinez Sanchez, Head of Analysis and Special Projects at Iberdrola, highlighted that renewables are gaining ground, but deployment is constrained: “To accelerate clean energy at scale, we need stronger policy support for infrastructure rollout and demand stimulation. Supply alone isn’t enough. We need demand-side incentives and industrial value chains to support solar, wind and battery manufacturing.”

Dr. Xie Tian, GM of LONGi’s Strategic Management Centre, pointed out that LONGi provides global climate mitigation solutions through technological innovation and intelligent green manufacturing. In terms of technological innovation, verified by Germany’s Hamelin Institute for Solar Energy (ISFH), the company’s independently developed Hybrid Interdigitated-Back-Contact (HIBC) crystalline silicon solar cell has achieved a conversion efficiency of 27.81% through calibration experiments, setting a new world record. In addition, the conversion efficiency of a two-terminal crystalline silicon-perovskite tandem solar cell developed by the company has been certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the United States to have reached 34.85%, once again breaking the world record.

Dr. Xie also informed attendees that LONGi’s Jiaxing base has achieved dual benchmark certification as both a “Lighthouse” and “Zero-Carbon” factory. This accomplishment has resulted in a 28% reduction in manufacturing costs, 84% shorter production lead times and 24.6% lower energy consumption per unit. Dr. Xie emphasized that, as the PV industry’s first dual-certified factory, the Jiaxing base underlines the company’s leadership in driving digital and green transformation across the sector. By integrating smart technologies into advanced PV manufacturing, LONGi pursues green production to further achieve carbon neutrality. The company has also implemented a data platform for ESG disclosure management, enabling verification and analysis of sustainability metrics.

Paul Frankel, Head of the Renewable Energy Department at the International Energy Agency (IEA), revealed at the meeting that the global installed capacity of renewable energy will increase by 700 gigawatts in 2024, with China making a significant contribution and ranking first in the world in terms of photovoltaic installed capacity. The IEA predicts that global installed capacity of renewable energy will increase by over 5500 gigawatts between 2024 and 2030, with solar photovoltaics becoming the main force due to cost reduction and accelerated approval.

FTI’s findings add weight to ongoing calls for structural reforms in how industrial energy is priced.
“We’ve now got clear evidence that zonal pricing will cut these costs at the source without pushing the burden onto households.","Electricity costs for vehicle manufacturers in the UK could be significantly reduced without increasing the financial burden on households or small businesses. That’s the key finding from a new report by FTI Consulting, commissioned by Octopus Energy.

The study examines the potential impact of introducing zonal pricing, a system that adjusts electricity rates based on local demand and supply. According to the analysis, this approach could reduce industrial electricity costs in the North East of England by nearly £6 million.

This would be a much-needed boost for the UK’s vehicle manufacturing industry, which currently faces some of the highest energy prices in the world. FTI’s findings add weight to ongoing calls for structural reforms in how industrial energy is priced.

The manufacturing group Make UK has recently underscored the pressure that high energy costs are placing on businesses. While the government’s existing energy subsidy has been beneficial to approximately 370 energy-intensive firms, the flip side is that it adds a substantial charge to everyone else’s energy bills. This levy now adds roughly £410 million a year to consumer costs, a figure projected to more than double by the 2030s.

Zonal pricing could change that. By making the electricity system more efficient, the model could save non-subsidised manufacturers an average of £12 to £16 per megawatt-hour by 2030. In some areas, like the North of Scotland, savings could reach as high as £29 per megawatt-hour.

Octopus Energy is now urging the government to rethink how energy is priced, advocating for a model that cuts costs at the root rather than passing them down to consumers.

The momentum behind the idea is growing. The House of Lords Industry and Regulators Committee has joined a growing list of supporters that includes Ofgem, NESO, Citizens Advice, and other leading voices in the energy sector.

Greg Jackson, CEO and Founder of Octopus Energy Group, said:

Britain’s manufacturers are being crushed by electricity costs, among the highest in the world.

“We’ve now got clear evidence that zonal pricing will cut these costs at the source without pushing the burden onto households.

“Instead of robbing Peter to pay Paul, zonal pricing can slash bills for heavy industry and households whilst accelerating our path to clean energy.”

Jason Mann, Senior Managing Director at FTI Consulting, said:

“Our work for Octopus on zonal pricing (and previously for Ofgem) shows that zonal pricing could materially benefit all British consumers. This is true for households as well as larger industrial consumers.

“Our most recent study indicates that with minor changes to the special arrangements that currently apply, all of the country’s very largest manufacturing plants could also benefit from lower electricity prices were zonal pricing to be implemented.”

Matthew Evans, Chief Operations Officer, techUK, said:

“The UK’s digital economy cannot remain globally competitive while data centres – core to AI, cloud computing, and high-performance technologies – face some of the highest industrial energy costs in the world.

Unlike other energy-intensive sectors, data centres bear 100% of network, policy, and balancing charges despite leading in renewable energy investment.

“If we want Britain to be a tech maker, not just a tech taker, we need urgent reform in energy pricing structures, including zonal pricing, that recognise the strategic value of digital infrastructure and remove cost-based barriers to growth.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_002d951e9d1e40238057aba8a96d79fb~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_815,h_503,al_c,lg_1,q_85/becc64_002d951e9d1e40238057aba8a96d79fb~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-06 12:19:13.876077

Hyundai slashes lease prices for the Ioniq 6 to attract EV buyers.

EV sales are witnessing a decline industry-wide, with a 6.2% drop recorded in June.

The expiration of federal tax credits could further impact demand for EVs.

Hyundai's Strategic Move: Lowering Lease Prices

Hyundai Motor Company (HYMTF) is making a bold attempt to boost its electric vehicle (EV) market share by slashing the monthly lease price of its Ioniq 6 model to just $169. This aggressive pricing strategy aims to entice consumers who are on the fence about transitioning from traditional gasoline vehicles to electric ones.

Industry-Wide Decline in EV Sales

Despite Hyundai's efforts, the EV market is facing challenges. Sales across the industry have seen a notable decline, with a significant 6.2% drop reported in June. This trend indicates a growing consumer reluctance to embrace electric vehicles, which could be attributed to several market dynamics.

The Impact of Federal Tax Credits

Adding to these challenges, the imminent expiration of federal tax credits is expected to further dampen demand for electric vehicles. These credits have played a crucial role in making EVs more affordable for consumers, and their expiration could create additional hurdles for the EV market's growth.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000NWR.png?20,N,,2025-07-06 15:04:56.506809

Large Electric SUV For America Axed It's important to note that the report claims that only the large electric SUV has been canceled.
Toyota recently pulled a similar move for its upcoming electric SUV, delaying its American-built SUVs and reallocating its upcoming production due to the popularity of the Grand Highlander.","Honda is one of those automakers that has slowed down their EV development due to weakening demand. Its 10-year plan, which shows a push for hybrids, was revealed earlier this year. It also confirmed a delay to three upcoming EVs based on the 0 Series SUV concept, launching between 2027 and 2028. Now, that plan has been scrapped for one of those three electric SUVs, according to a fresh report from Tokyo.

The information came from Nikkei Asia, which cites the continued weakening demand for EVs in the US as the main reason for the cancelation. In particular, the Japanese marque has projected a further delay in EV adoption in America due to the recently passed ""Big, Beautiful Bill,"" which will remove the $7,500 federal tax credit on qualified brand-new EVs after September 30, 2025.

Large Electric SUV For America Axed

It's important to note that the report claims that only the large electric SUV has been canceled. The battery-powered midsize SUV and sedan, which were both previewed by the 0 Series Concepts, are still happening, with the low-slung model arriving first in 2026. Honda has also started showing the midsize 0 Series SUV to the public during the Japanese Grand Prix in April.

The large SUV was supposed to be primed for the American market, where 60% of the automaker's sales are for high-riding models. However, due to the higher cost of development, the declining demand posed uncertainty in terms of sales. Honda has previously announced a reduction in its EV-related investments through the end of the decade, from 10 trillion yen ($69 billion) to 7 trillion yen ($48 billion).

Investing More In Hybrids For More Revenue

Unsurprisingly, the automaker will now allocate its resources to pushing for the development of hybrids. Looking back at its 10-year plan, the automaker is almost confirmed to be electrifying its entire lineup, including possible hybrid versions of the Pilot, Passport, and Odyssey, which will push sales and revenue for the automaker while preparing for another wave of EV push.

Toyota recently pulled a similar move for its upcoming electric SUV, delaying its American-built SUVs and reallocating its upcoming production due to the popularity of the Grand Highlander. The launch of the two EVs will now happen in late 2026 and 2028. Ford also recently announced a detour in its EV plans, which involves allowing Nissan to use a part of its flagship battery manufacturing facility in Kentucky.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/honda-0-suv-exterior-front-quarter-03.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 12:19:01.909557

“These programs that require compliance with a radical climate agenda undermine American farmers and ranchers, threaten to drive up costs for consumers, and weaken food security for working families.”","Eleven state agriculture commissioners called on the Trump administration and Congress to yank funding from United Nations programs that they say are hurting American farmers.

“The federal government should stop using American taxpayer dollars to fund the United Nations International Maritime Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the United Nations Environment Program, because each of these organizations’ net-zero policies will have devastating effects on American consumers, farmers, and ranchers, and further endanger food security for the poor in America,” said the July 1 letter.

“Net-zero” refers to policies that aim to reduce the net amount of carbon emissions to zero by the year 2050, either by fully eliminating them or by offsetting them.

The letter continues:

The U.S. should also eliminate funding for these organizations due to the harmful effects of their policies on American agriculture. The U.S. contributed (by far) the largest share of any country to FAO’s [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations] 2023 budget, accounting for $391 million of the $1.5 billion total. This contribution was over two-and-a-half times more than the second-highest contributor (Germany with $154 million). And the U.S. was the second largest contributor to UNEP [United Nations Environment Program] in 2023, providing over $49 million of a $502.6 million budget. The U.S. (one of IMO’s [United Nations International Maritime Organization] 176 member states) contributed $1.5 million of IMO’s $20 million 2023 budget, making it the 14th-largest funder of the IMO.

The letter went to Trump Cabinet officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

It also went to Senate and House Budget Committee Chairmen Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Jody Arrington, R-Texas, respectively, as well as Senate and House Agriculture Committee Chairmen John Boozman, R-Ark., and Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., among other members of Congress.

Elected and appointed state agriculture officials signed the letter, arguing that the U.N. agencies’ net-zero policies violate President Donald Trump’s executive order to withdraw from U.N. groups that have strayed from their missions.

“We continue to see programs being funded by U.S. taxpayers that are pushing a radical climate agenda through the agriculture industry,” said Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, a group that has teamed up with state officials in the past to combat taxpayer funding of left-leaning causes.

“The Trump administration has made it clear that energy policies should be focused on unleashing America’s energy dominance, not woke, net-zero policies. America’s farmers and ranchers don’t just feed our nation; they feed the world,” Hild added in a public statement. “These programs that require compliance with a radical climate agenda undermine American farmers and ranchers, threaten to drive up costs for consumers, and weaken food security for working families.”",https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AgComs-UN.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 11:11:31.722677

About 9% of the $261 billion in green factory investment announced since 2021 has been shelved — most of it since President Donald Trump returned to office in January — according to research firm Atlas Public Policy.
Close to the Kore site is the suburban sprawl that’s come to characterize the Phoenix area’s rapid growth.
It’s one of 53 out of 715 green factories announced since 2021 that have been cancelled, according to Atlas Public Policy.
“Maybe another green energy one will,” he said.","The vast tract of land off Route 85 was meant to be a symbol of Made-in-America manufacturing. A billion-dollar battery factory was going to rise, bringing thousands of new jobs. The business announced, “Get Ready Arizona,” the governor said the state was thrilled and even the US president gave the project a shoutout.

But here, in the boomtown of Buckeye, less than an hour away from Phoenix, the 214-acre lot sits empty. Work on the site had started, said Shelby Lizarraga, who manages the gas station next door, “but then it went all quiet.”

Four years after the fanfare, battery maker Kore Power Inc. abandoned its plans for a plant in Buckeye. The company’s chief executive officer stepped down and a promised $850 million federal loan was cancelled.

Kore isn’t alone in its dashed ambitions. In Massachusetts, a wind turbine cable factory set to be built on the site of a former coal power plant was scrapped. In Georgia, the construction of a facility that would have made parts for electric vehicle batteries was suspended more than halfway through. And in Colorado, a lithium-ion battery maker said it wouldn’t go forward with its factory there, at least for now.

They’re among the dozens of planned green factories that have been cancelled, with more delayed or downsized, all hit by soaring costs, high interest rates and slow-growing EV demand. About 9% of the $261 billion in green factory investment announced since 2021 has been shelved — most of it since President Donald Trump returned to office in January — according to research firm Atlas Public Policy. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said his agency doesn’t plan to move forward with some of the big-dollar loans that had been made to green manufacturing plants during President Joe Biden’s term.

Now there’s another, major threat to the sector: Trump’s massive tax-and-spending package, which rolls back Biden’s generous green subsidies.

Signed into law by Trump on Friday, it phases out credits for producing solar and wind energy years before they were designed to expire. It also ends federal tax credits for electric vehicles this September instead of in 2032.

Under Biden, a Democratic Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act a year later, setting aside hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for clean-energy projects. New factories were announced from South Carolina to Michigan to Arizona, set to churn out EVs, batteries and clean-energy parts. Biden and Democrats sought to bring manufacturing back to the US and make the country independent of, and competitive with, fast-electrifying China.

Many of the projects would be in red and purple states, shielding the policy against GOP attacks — or so the thinking went. That idea has now collapsed. (Among the members of Congress who voted for Trump’s bill was Paul Gosar, a Republican who represents Buckeye.)

Trump said at the signing that the country “is going to be a rocketship economically.” But fallout is likely to include more clean energy projects and the jobs they provide, or could have. Tesla Inc. Chief Elon Musk had lambasted the package on X as “severely damaging” to “industries of the future.”

The US pulling back now means it will lag other countries that have invested in green technologies, and that will hurt economic growth and boost reliance on overseas manufacturers long term, said Hannah Hess of Rhodium Group, a research firm.

“There’s also the risk of stranded investments, a sizable amount,” she said.

Lithium-ion battery manufacturers like Kore face strict rules on using foreign components, plus knock-on effects from the solar and EV credit phaseouts. Because of the former, fewer grid batteries will be installed over the next decade, according to the research group Energy Innovation. The demise of the EV credit will likely dent consumer appetite for electric vehicles — and by extension, demand for the batteries they run on.

Buckeye — a former farming town named by settlers from Ohio — is a hotbed of building activity. Close to the Kore site is the suburban sprawl that’s come to characterize the Phoenix area’s rapid growth. Concrete is being poured in foundations and piles of rebar are stacked on construction sites, where tracts of desert are being transformed into new neighborhoods.

Executives at Kore had scoured 300 sites across the country before settling on Buckeye. Land was cheap, it was close to major West Coast ports and Arizona’s dry climate wouldn’t impair the chemistry of lithium-ion batteries. The company announced its factory in 2021, planning to start construction that year and roll out batteries in 2023. It would be Buckeye’s biggest employer, creating 3,000 jobs.

But as executives drew up construction plans, inflation hiked costs, while rising interest rates made financing more expensive. And the project got mired in the same slow permitting that stalls projects nationwide.

Costs swelled to $1.25 billion from $1 billion, so the company made adjustments to control expenses — even downsizing the factory — and worked aggressively to keep the project alive, Kore’s current CEO Jay Bellows said in a telephone interview. “We were trying to move as fast as we could,” Bellows said. “But ultimately, the costs were just really high.” The battery maker later got a loan commitment from the Energy Department.

Kore ended up getting approvals to move forward with construction in 2024, almost a year after it had wanted to start producing batteries. And then uncertainty loomed over the fate of federal green incentives if Trump were to win the election.

In Buckeye’s city hall, about 10 minutes away from Kore’s site, Mayor Eric Orsborn sensed that things were amiss. The project’s timeline kept getting longer and delays dragged out. “Things slipped a little bit more, a little bit more,” he said in an interview in his office.

Kore then said it was ending its plans to build in Buckeye, 10 days after Trump was sworn in. It’s one of 53 out of 715 green factories announced since 2021 that have been cancelled, according to Atlas Public Policy.

The outlook for green enterprises has darkened as policy shifts unsettle manufacturers, with EV makers feeling it the most, said Matt Shanahan of Marathon Capital, an investment bank focused on the energy transition. “The rules have changed,” he said.

The pace of cancellations and delays depends on how the market reacts to the law, he added, but early-stage projects are especially at risk. “To break ground on a new facility — I think it’s very challenging right now.” Energy storage may remain more resilient thanks to surging data center demand, he said.

Kore is now on the hunt for an existing building to move into, with power and infrastructure in place so it can save money and get to market faster, Bellows said. Looking back, he said he learned the need to move more quickly and efficiently. The company tried, he said, but “it’s a long, arduous process” to go from dirt to a fully operating factory.

Even so, other green facilities in the region are forging ahead. In Queen Creek, another fast-growing community that’s about 80 miles to the west of Buckeye, construction is underway on a $3 billion EV battery facility by LG Energy Solution. Cranes tower over the sprawling site, while bulldozers kick up plumes of desert dust as forklifts scuttle by. The project has faced its own challenges — construction was paused for some time last year as the company scrapped plans for a bigger plant.

But now the factory is set to open next year, and LG plans to employ 1,500 workers there by 2027. The company said in an April press release that it aims to contribute to a “local battery ecosystem” and that it will hire locally.

“It’s a manufacturing powerhouse,” Queen Creek Mayor Julia Wheatley said in an interview, adding that the town is seeing strong interest from companies looking to move near the plant.

On a Monday in late June, the empty Kore plot scorched in 100F-plus heat. Nearby, desert gave way to parcels of farmland, discount stores and palm-tree-lined neighborhoods. Dairy cows took shade from the heat, while trucks stacked with hay bales hurtled by.

Across the road, Joe Skoog, who runs a trucking company, said he would have liked to have pitched his business to Kore had the factory gone ahead. But he didn’t see the cancellation as much of a setback for the growing region. “Come back in five, 10 years’ time, and there will be more manufacturers and warehouses, and fewer farms,” he said.

Orsborn, Buckeye’s mayor, said he was disappointed, but not disheartened. He enthused about Buckeye’s population boom, fueled by Californian transplants, the big-box retailers and movie theaters opening up and howKore’s shovel-ready site — with power, water and infrastructure now installed — is now even more attractive for other businesses that want to move in.

“Maybe another green energy one will,” he said.

Currently, Huawei doesn’t manufacture its own branded vehicles in China, but instead works with various automakers to apply some of its existing technologies to vehicles.

According to the patent application, its batteries use a method that ‘dopes’ sulfide electrolytes with nitrogen to address side reactions at the lithium interface. However, it is keeping the remainder of its technology close to its chest, as the race to mass-produce solid-state battery technology safely and at scale is well and truly on.

What’s more, the company theorizes that it is able to eke some 1,864 miles of range from its battery technology, as well as complete the industry standard 10-80% charge in less than five minutes.

However, some industry experts are skeptical of those bold claims, pointing out that it is a leap of more than three times the current range abilities of the most impressive electric vehicles on sale today.

Speaking to Electrek, Yang Min-ho, professor of energy engineering at Dankook University, said that such performance “might be possible in lab conditions” but went on to explain that reproducing the results in the real world, where energy loss and thermal management play a key role, would be “extremely difficult”.

The professor was also quick to point out that the nitrogen doping method is a “standard technique” that, again, can be applied in a laboratory environment but is currently difficult to scale to a point where it can be mass produced to meet the demands of global automakers.

Understandably, China is basking in its EV dominance at the moment and it isn’t afraid to publicize innovations that have the potential to change the game.

MegaWatt charging is one of the more recent topics, but solid-state batteries have also been bubbling sway under the surface for some time. Undoubtedly, China will be the first to this technology, but it likely won’t be as soon as many domestic companies make out, nor as impressive.

What’s more, the 1,800-mile figures seem largely pointless, as it would require a huge battery pack that is going to add excess weight and blunt driving dynamics in a vain attempt to dispel notions of range anxiety.

Should Huawei be able to nail energy densities between 400 and 500 Wh/kg, it would be far better placed producing smaller packs that can still offer an impressive range without the need for enormous, expensive batteries.

When an EV can easily cover 600 miles on a single charge, range anxiety largely becomes obsolete, as there are so few drivers that want to sit for hours on end without a break. Plus, with the public charging network expanding and improving year-on-year, it is now arguably easier than ever to find a spot to plug in and stretch the legs.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Huawei-华为-Logo.png,N,,2025-07-06 12:20:21.076543

Bear Case How might regulatory challenges impact Duke Energy’s growth plans?","Duke Energy (NYSE: ), with a market capitalization of $91.2 billion and a commanding presence in the North American power and utilities sector, is navigating a complex landscape of opportunities and challenges as it pursues an ambitious growth strategy. The company’s focus on transitioning to cleaner energy sources and modernizing its grid infrastructure has caught the attention of analysts, who see potential for significant returns despite some headwinds. According to InvestingPro data, Duke Energy has demonstrated remarkable stability with a beta of just 0.35, making it an attractive option for investors seeking lower volatility in their portfolios.

Company Overview and Strategic Initiatives

Duke Energy has embarked on a substantial capital expenditure (capex) plan, with projections ranging from $82.5 billion to $83 billion over the next five years. This investment is primarily directed towards generation and grid improvements, positioning the company for long-term growth and efficiency gains. The scale of this capex plan is noteworthy, with analysts projecting one of the highest capex growth rates among regulated utilities, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% from 2025 to 2029.

A key component of Duke Energy’s strategy is its focus on cleaner energy sources. The company has set ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. These goals not only align with broader industry trends but also enhance Duke Energy’s sustainability credentials, potentially attracting environmentally conscious investors and customers.

Strategic partnerships play a crucial role in Duke Energy’s growth plans. A notable collaboration with GE Vernova allows the company to secure gas turbines efficiently, supporting its plan to add over 5 gigawatts (GW) of gas generation by 2029. This partnership exemplifies Duke Energy’s approach to leveraging industry relationships to gain competitive advantages and streamline its expansion efforts.

Financial Performance and Outlook

Duke Energy’s financial projections paint a picture of steady growth. The company has guided for 2025 earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $6.17 to $6.42, with a midpoint of $6.30, representing a 5.4% year-over-year growth. Looking further ahead, Duke Energy aims for an EPS CAGR of 5% to 7%, with expectations to achieve the upper half of this range by the end of the decade. InvestingPro analysis reveals the company’s strong dividend track record, having raised dividends for 17 consecutive years and maintained payments for 55 years straight. With current annual revenue of $30.5 billion and an EBITDA of $14.9 billion, Duke Energy demonstrates robust financial fundamentals despite trading above its Fair Value according to InvestingPro’s proprietary valuation model.

Analysts are optimistic about Duke Energy’s growth trajectory. Projections suggest an EPS CAGR of 6.8% from 2025 to 2029, slightly above the street consensus of 6.7%. This growth is expected to be driven by the company’s robust capex plan and increasing power demand, particularly in its core markets such as the Carolinas.

The company’s dividend policy also reflects its financial health and commitment to shareholder returns. Projections indicate annual increases in dividends per share, rising from $4.06 in 2023 to an estimated $4.35 in 2026.

Regulatory Environment

Duke Energy operates in a heavily regulated industry, and its performance is significantly influenced by regulatory outcomes. Recent developments have been largely positive for the company. A favorable final order in Duke Energy Indiana’s General Rate Case by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a two-step revenue requirement increase and a 9.75% Return on Equity (ROE). This outcome has substantially derisked Duke Energy’s regulatory calendar, allowing investors to focus on the company’s refreshed 5-year financial outlook and growth prospects.

However, the regulatory landscape remains a double-edged sword. While recent outcomes have been favorable, future regulatory challenges could pose risks to Duke Energy’s growth plans and financial performance. The company must continue to navigate complex regulatory environments across its operating regions to ensure continued success.

Bear Case

How might regulatory challenges impact Duke Energy’s growth plans?

Despite recent favorable regulatory outcomes, Duke Energy remains vulnerable to potential shifts in the regulatory landscape. Future rate cases or policy changes could result in less favorable terms, potentially impacting the company’s ability to recover costs or maintain desired ROEs. This could lead to reduced earnings growth or necessitate adjustments to the company’s ambitious capex plans.

Moreover, the potential repeal of nuclear production tax credits (PTCs) or failure to qualify for them could significantly impact Duke Energy’s financial projections. Such a scenario might require additional equity issuance, potentially diluting shareholder value and putting pressure on the company’s credit ratings.

What risks does Duke Energy face in executing its large-scale capex projects?

The scale of Duke Energy’s capex plan, while promising for growth, also presents significant execution risks. Large-scale infrastructure projects are inherently complex and can face delays, cost overruns, or technical challenges. Any major setbacks in implementing these projects could impact the company’s financial performance and growth trajectory.

Additionally, the rapid pace of technological change in the energy sector poses a risk. Investments made today may become less competitive or even obsolete if new, more efficient technologies emerge. Duke Energy must carefully balance its investments in current technologies with the flexibility to adapt to future innovations.

Bull Case

How does Duke Energy’s strategic partnerships position it for future growth?

Duke Energy’s strategic partnerships, such as its collaboration with GE Vernova, provide the company with significant competitive advantages. These relationships allow Duke Energy to secure critical equipment and technologies efficiently, supporting its ambitious expansion plans. The partnership with GE Vernova, in particular, enables Duke Energy to add substantial gas generation capacity, a key component of its transition strategy.

Furthermore, these partnerships may open doors to new technologies and innovations, potentially giving Duke Energy early access to cutting-edge solutions in areas such as grid modernization and renewable energy integration. This positions the company well to adapt to the evolving energy landscape and maintain its leadership in the sector.

What opportunities does Duke Energy have in new nuclear generation and SMRs?

Duke Energy is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities in new nuclear generation, including small modular reactors (SMRs). As the energy sector continues to seek low-carbon baseload power sources, nuclear energy, particularly advanced technologies like SMRs, could play a crucial role.

The company’s existing expertise in nuclear operations, combined with its strong regulatory relationships and financial resources, places it in an advantageous position to pursue these opportunities. Successful development and deployment of new nuclear technologies could provide Duke Energy with a significant competitive edge, supporting its long-term growth and sustainability goals.

By the calculations of the conservation groups, this puts the new gas plant at $327 million -- or 3.6% more expensive.
The Colorado Energy Office urged that Tri-State explore sharing gas production with Xcel Energy, which is also closing its coal plants in northwestern Colorado.","This story originally appeared in Big Pivots.

Coal-burning for electrical generation will end in Craig before New Year's Day of 2028 arrives. Will a new gas plant arrive in 2029 to partially replace the lost generation?

Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association says it needs a 307-megawatt gas plant there to ensure electricity will be available for its members across its four-state service territory, but particularly western Colorado.

Three conservation groups argue strenuously that Tri-State can keep the lights on without the gas plant -- and at a cost that is $288 million less and with fewer greenhouse gas emissions. They instead recommend more battery storage in lieu of the gas plant.

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to make a decision on July 10. However, the PUC commissioners must first decide whether to order Tri-State to conduct additional modeling, as the conservation groups want. New modeling, however, would take time.

""Time is of the essence,"" Tri-State said in a PUC filing on June 25. It warned of ""serious risk of cost escalation"" if procurement of renewables is delayed, citing snarled supply chains and rising prices caused by the tariffs imposed on imports by President Donald Trump, and a reshaped tax landscape in the budget reconciliation bill before Congress.

For example, nearly all battery cells come from China. Many photovoltaic solar components also come from China. And the budget bill would strip tax credits for most renewable projects.

New gas plants have problems, too. Rising demand has caused lengthening wait times and higher prices. Companies that have not yet reserved the giant metal turbines now face waits of three or four years, about twice as long as just a year earlier, reported the New York Times in April. The report cited rapidly increasing demand from data centers.

""With demand for gas turbines reaching new heights and tariffs further threatening international supply chains, costs for new gas plants are soaring,"" said a team from Boulder- and Basalt-based RMI in a June 18 report.

Colorado in the next five years will put coal in its rear-view mirror. The state got 80% of its electricity from coal combustion at the start of the 21st century. That had slipped to 60% in 2015. By the end of 2030, the state's last coal plant, Comanche 3, located in Pueblo, will go silent.

All the state's largest utilities are investing heavily in wind, solar and lithium-ion batteries. They are also hedging their bets with new gas plants. Brighton-based United Power is in the lead. During July it will formally dedicate a new 162-megawatt gas plant about 45 miles northeast of downtown Denver. The electrical cooperative is currently exempt from PUC regulation.

Xcel Energy, like Tri-State, must gain approval of the PUC commissioners. In another case currently before the PUC, Xcel says it needs between 1,050 megawatts and 2,625 megawatts of new generation as it closes coal plants and gets ready for a massive increase in new demand, about two-thirds of it from data centers. How real is that projected demand? Question marks littered the testimony in recent hearings before the PUC.

Two other utilities, Platte River Power Authority and Colorado Springs Utilities, also plan new gas plants. And like United, they are also exempt from PUC regulation.

The dispute about the gas plant at Craig revolves around perceptions of risk and uncertainty. Reliability of electrical supplies remains paramount. How to achieve that without significant cost increases?

Long-distance transmission across multiple time zones and weather systems will help. That, however, is both expensive and usually takes a decade or longer.

Reliable and affordable long-duration storage has become the holy grail in this energy transition. For example, Xcel Energy is partnering with Form Energy in an iron-air pilot project in Pueblo. This technology stores energy by essentially ""rusting"" iron during discharge and ""unrusting"" it during charging, making it a potential alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage for up to 100 hours.

The difference this particular longer-duration technology will make in future needs is not clear. Xcel certainly is not betting its future on an outcome. It wants natural gas, too.

As for Tri-State, it views a gas plant as having 95% reliability compared to 50% for renewables. It frets that it has no experience with battery storage, although in any scenario it will soon have many of them in various parts of Colorado and New Mexico.

The question then becomes, in part, whether to delay expensive investments in a new natural gas plant for a couple years to see what new technological wrinkles may make that investment unnecessary.

Tri-State 15 years ago remained heavily dusted with coal. As former Gov. Bill Ritter noted at a recent event, Tri-State's leaders then fervently believed their future lay in coal forevermore. It's a substantially different utility now. It will retire the first of the three units at Craig by the end of 2025 with the remaining two in 2027. It owns another unit in Arizona, at Springerville, which it will close in 2030. After that, it will own just one coal-burning unit at the Laramie River Station in Wyoming.

As it prepares to leave coal mostly behind, Tri-State has begun building large amounts of new renewables, including a solar farm in the Axial Basin south of Craig, near a coal mine.

This plan calls for the addition of 700 megawatts of wind and solar between 2026 and 2031. On top of that Tri-State wants to add 650 megawatts of four-hour battery storage.

As for gas, it proposes to replace the five turbines at the J.M. Shafer plant near Fort Lupton, increasing the capacity from 272 megawatts to 281 megawatts. The environmental community has no quarrel with that plan.

The new gas plant at Craig is the fulcrum for the dispute. Tri-State says it needs the eight new turbines of natural gas at Craig specially for peak demands or when renewables come short. The environmental community maintains that 550 megawatts of battery storage beyond what Tri-State proposes will do the trick.

""Although battery integration is important for a balanced energy strategy, the immediate needs of the Western Colorado system, particularly in the transition away from coal, require the inclusion of reliable dispatchable resources like gas plants to ensure system reliability,"" the utility said in a June 10 filing.

Just transition is another element of the conversation. In 2019, state legislators adopted goals for an 80% decrease in emissions by 2030 as compared to 2025 levels. On the coattails of that goal-setting was the declaration that ""strong and comprehensive policy is ... needed to invest new financial resources in coal communities that are seeking to diversify and grow their local and regional economies in a manner that is both sustainable and equitable.""

In a settlement agreement reached in June 2024, Tri-State committed to paying $22 million to Craig and Moffat County from 2026 through 2029 to aid the community's energy transition.

Tri-State is also on the hook for an addition $48 million in the next decade for lost property tax base -- unless it adds new tax base. In that case, the new tax base will be deducted from the utility's obligations. Part of its plan is to place 200 megawatts of battery storage in the Craig area by 2030. A gas plant would help even more, as Craig and Moffat County point out in their comments in support of Tri-State.

Once again, does Tri-State really need the gas plant to ensure the lights stay on during hot summer days and winter weeks when wind wanes as it did during Storm Uri in February 2021.

The conservation coalition -- Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council and Western Resource Advocates -- insist Tri-State has not proven the need. In a June 18 filing with the PUC, they raised what they call ""serious questions about the accuracy of Tri-State's modeling."" They want the PUC to order Tri-State to conduct new modeling, a move that Tri-State resists because of the added time. Again, it says, time is of the essence.

Costs of the gas/no gas choices can be measured in several ways. Tri-State prefers a financial measuring stick called present value of revenue requirements to assess the cost of the extra-batteries option. This tool provides the total costs over the next 19 years.

By this measure, the heavier investment in batteries will require Tri-State to generate $88 million over the next 19 years. That difference is just 0.5% more in revenue spread across the more than $16 billion in revenue Tri-State projects is needed for both portfolios, say the conservation groups. A small price, say the conservation groups, of just 0.5% of increased cost in an outlay of more than $16 billion in capital outlays.

If the social costs of carbon and methane are factored in, the no-gas alternative will actually be cheaper, contend Western Resource Advocates and the two allied groups, the Sierra Club, and Natural Resources Defense Council. The PUC is required to consider these climate change impacts but is not required to use it as a basis for a decision. By the calculations of the conservation groups, this puts the new gas plant at $327 million -- or 3.6% more expensive.

The most compelling numbers for the environmental advocates are the up-front capital costs. By that measure, building the gas plant and new transmission needed for its preferred projects will cost $288 million more than the deeper investment in batteries.

What others had to say

Other agencies and groups at the table (called ""intervenors"" in PUC dockets) didn't raise objections to the gas plant. The Office of Utility Consumer Advocate, for example, saw the benefit to Moffat County as a positive more important than the ""slightly higher emissions"" caused by the new gas plant. It buys Tri-State's argument about improved reliability.

The Colorado Energy Office urged that Tri-State explore sharing gas production with Xcel Energy, which is also closing its coal plants in northwestern Colorado. (Tri-State responded that it has explored that possibility but gave no evidence that the conversations were producing anything.)

The energy office and San Miguel County also mentioned a hope that Tri-State would get electricity from enhanced geothermal. Tri-State reported it had received a bid for a 20-megawatt geothermal plant, likely the first such bid in Colorado. It did not select it.

John Clark, the mayor of Ridgway, also wrote in support of geothermal. ""I've always been climate-conscious and truly believe there's no limit to the number of efforts we should be pursuing in an attempt to avoid the worst of what could come if we don't do enough about climate change,"" Clark told Big Pivots in an e-mail.

""We live in a promising area for geothermal,"" he added, and enhanced geothermal -- created by tapping heat from deep well -- is an around-the-clock source of energy.

If Tri-State is based in Colorado and has its largest number of electrical cooperatives within Colorado, it also supplies electrical cooperatives in Wyoming and New Mexico and public power districts in Nebraska. It's one system stretched across the four states. Members from all four states wrote letters both in support and against the gas plant.

Most supportive of the gas plant were the eight member cooperatives in Wyoming. They pointed to double-digit rate increases projected by Tri-State and continued rate impacts for the next decade. They suggested that the costs are due to adding renewables and the goals for emissions reductions.

From New Mexico came exactly the opposite argument from several state legislators, county commissioners, and Navajo Nation members. The alternative favored by conservationists is a ""viable -- and superior -- alternative to spending several hundred million dollars on a gas plant that will emit millions of tons of greenhouse gases over its expected operating life,"" they said.

Colorado elected officials have also weighed in with a letter signed by 33 individuals from town, city, and county staffs as well as elected officials. That letter, too, made the economic case against a new gas plant as well as the climate benefits.

Chaffee County Commissioner PT Wood, one of the signatories, told Big Pivots that he has personal doubts the reliability of natural gas. Coal was supposed to be reliable, but the Comanche 3 generating station at Pueblo has been closed for extended periods. Plus, he sees the extraction of natural gas as being ""incredibly harmful to the landscape.""

Many individual letters were filed with the PUC, obviously developed using a common template but with some localized embellishment.

From Mancos, west of Durango, Brandi Lynn Piller described a new gas-fired plant as ""fraught with financial risks due to volatile market prices and high construction costs.""

From Walsh, a few miles from the Kansas and Oklahoma borders, Fred and Kay Lyn Hefley noted the installation of two 50-kWh wind generators on their farm. ""We strongly urge Tri-State to achieve its goal of 100% clean energy in Colorado by 2040 using wind and solar power.""

And from Matheson, on the windy plains about 50 miles east of Colorado Springs, Jan Kochis, and her husband, Virgil Kochis, said they strongly oppose the gas plant at Craig because it ""contradicts Colorado's decarbonization goals and risks becoming an obsolete asset, potentially burdening co-op members with hundreds of millions in stranded costs, as seen in past fossil fuel missteps."" They have 30 wind turbines on their property that generate electricity for Xcel.

Martha Whitmore, of Ridgway, saw it entirely differently. Whitmore said Tri-State was going far too far into renewables. They are ""not constant, not reliable and (are) expensive to develop. If the State of Colorado is hell bent on eliminating reliable fuels, then the State had better get going with permitting new nuclear facilities. And, since the same enviros who scream about carbon also scream about not wanting nuclear power either, better not decommission our existing coal and natural gas power plants. We will be on rolling blackouts ...""

But the industry is now facing an all-out assault from President Donald Trump.

His signature “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which Trump signed into law on July 4, heavily targets the industry, which Trump has labeled the “green new scam.” The legislation eliminates a 30 percent tax credit for residential rooftop solar panels by the end of 2025, as well as those dedicated to utility-scale solar and wind, although plants that are already financed and approved by June 2026 — or that are operational by 2027 — can still qualify for the credits. (The credit for solar leasing companies will also last through 2027 and can be passed through to consumers.) The bill also eliminates tax credits for electric vehicles and chargers, as well as battery storage systems, geothermal heating, electric panel upgrades, energy audits and weatherization, all of which can lower consumer’s energy bills.

In a last minute move, however, Republicans struck a proposed excise tax on wind and solar projects if the materials included a percentage of minerals sourced from certain foreign countries. Experts say that, regardless of the excise tax reprieve and the included grandfather provisions, the clean energy industry will be badly hurt and consumers’ energy prices could rise by eight to 10 percent.

The clean energy industry’s growth and hefty economic impacts are due in part to former president Joe Biden’s signature $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act of 2021 and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which he signed into law the following year.

The clean energy industry’s growth and hefty economic impacts are due in part to former president Joe Biden’s signature $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act of 2021 and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which he signed into law the following year. The latter provided for $369 billion in clean energy and climate-related spending over 10 ten years to nurture renewable technologies, including EVs, energy-efficient appliances, rooftop solar panels and batteries, geothermal heating, heat pumps, industrial clean energy storage and biogas systems.

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contained billions for the electrification of transportation and a rapid expansion of electric vehicle charging stations. Calling it a “landmark bill,” the League of Conservation Voters said it also makes it easier for everyday people to save hundreds or thousands of dollars on energy costs and transition to clean energy in their homes, vehicles, schools and businesses while reducing fossil-fuel emissions.

New cost-effective technologies — such as ultra-high performance bifacial solar panels, which are able to absorb light from both sides of the panel and deliver over 700 Watts per module with little output degradation over 30 years — have contributed to the industry’s positive economic impact. Solar power is now often cheaper than the operating costs, let alone the construction costs, of older coal plants which take years to build and permit, and there is at least a six-year wait for new combustion turbines used in gas-fired power plants. By contrast, solar plants can be built in six to 18 months. Of the new power capacity added to the grid in 2024, 96 percent was non-carbon based energy.

The industry employs 3.5 million Americans. According to a new report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP), “Clean power manufacturing contributes $18 billion to GDP [Gross Domestic Product] annually,” creates $33 billion in investment “and supports 122,000 American jobs” with an average salary of $118,000 a year.

As a whole, the clean energy sector added 400,000 new jobs from 2020 to 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Had the industry remained unfettered, its manufacturing could have contributed $86 billion to the GDP annually and supported over 575,000 jobs by 2030, with those investments coming mainly in rural Republican areas.

Trump had the renewable energy industry in his sights from the first day of his new administration, when he signed an executive order proclaiming a national energy emergency — even though, under Biden, the U.S. produced more oil and natural gas than any other nation and was the world’s third-largest coal producer. The order was seen by many as fulfillment of Trump’s promise to strip away regulations on the fossil-fuel industry, from which he requested $1 billion in contributions to his 2024 presidential campaign.

In his emergency declaration, Trump contended that all aspects of energy and critical minerals — leasing, development, production, transportation, refining and generation — “are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs.”

Accusing the prior administration of “harmful and shortsighted policies” that allegedly created “inadequate energy supply” and high energy prices, the order declared those policies created “a national emergency” requiring swift, decisive action to avoid a dramatic future crisis “due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology,” presumably AI.

The U.S. does have an emergency, Dr. Daniel Kammen told Grist in the wake of Trump’s executive order. A distinguished professor of energy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former U.S. science envoy, he said it’s not one caused by energy scarcity but by the nation’s heavy dependence on fossil fuels and the relatively leisurely pace of its transition to clean energy, despite the global climate crisis.

The emergency declaration also seeks to weaken enforcement of environmental regulations, including those covered by the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, and to eliminate regulations that might impede the construction of oil and gas pipelines and other fossil-fuel facilities. It omits any mention of providing clean, safe and sustainable energy.

The order was correct, however, in stating that the nation needs a reliable, diversified and affordable supply of energy — and in recognizing that AI technology is sharply increasing U.S. power needs.

We need your help to stay independent

In Memphis, Tenn., the xAI Colossus data center, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, uses inefficient and highly-polluting portable gas turbine generators, which are typically intended for short-term or emergency use, to meet much of the plant’s ongoing power demand. The data center currently consumes 300 megawatts of power, enough to power 100,000 homes, according to CNN, and is seen as a threat and a corporate polluter by many residents of Boxtown, a majority Black, low-income community.

ACP Executive Director Jason Grumet, calling attention to “skyrocketing demand” for power in the U.S., said that “two Texas[es]” worth of new demand is being added to the grid every decade. “Our country deserves better than a Congress that plays ping pong with our economy and our security.”

Eager to sway Congress in its favor, the industry now has in place a $40 million lobbying campaign to defend its interests. “We have to confront the uncomfortable reality that the greatest threat to reliable energy is an unreliable political system,” Grumet said.

Powered by its strong economic fundamentals, the clean power industry seems unlikely to be crushed by the Trump administration’s hostile measures. Now that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has become law, the industry’s growth and financing will be severely diminished — and American families and businesses will be paying more for energy.",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2024/08/maintenance_worker_installing_solar_panels_to_house_1169021383.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 10:02:33.643509

U.S. companies are now also free to leak as much methane—a hazardous planet-warming greenhouse gas—as they want into the atmosphere for another decade, throwing out a Biden-era penalty on methane emissions.

It sounds bad—and it indeed is. Climate scientists and environmentalists have warned that the bill could seriously harm air quality, jeopardize public health and accelerate planet warming by encouraging more fossil fuel use. But according to research firm BloombergNEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook 2025, there’s still some reason for optimism: EVs are expected to continue displacing millions of barrels of crude oil each year.

Even if the U.S. slowdown results in 14 million fewer EV sales globally by 2030, the broader transition towards cleaner energy will continue to march on across the world, according to BNEF.

In fact, the future of the oil and gas industry is looking weak, even though it managed to bag a chest-thumping victory this week in the U.S. with the passage of the Trump administration’s Big Beautiful Bill—that victory will only give petroleum companies short-term benefits. Over the long term, oil consumption is still on track to go down drastically and EV sales are expected to grow with new and more competent models.

According to BNEF’s economic transition scenario, the first million daily barrels of road fuel displacement happened in 2018 thanks to early adoption of EVs. Owners who bought EVs stopped visiting gas stations, meaning the petroleum companies started losing those regular customers. Plus, studies show the vast majority of car buyers who make the switch to EVs don’t return to gas cars.

It took another six years for the next million barrels of road fuel to get displaced—by 2024 the world was displacing two million barrels of road fuel per day. For reference, that’s almost equal to how much the whole of South Korea uses in a single day.

By the end of the decade, EVs are expected to displace more than five million barrels of road fuel per day. For context, the U.S. consumed around 20 million barrels of oil daily in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Had the clean energy policies survived, that number might have dropped even faster. But with Europe and China charging ahead with EV adoption, the U.S. will now be left behind.

This projected decline in oil demand means the world’s leading oil producers now have EVs on their minds. Big Oil has grand plans to become Big EV, as Business Insider said in 2023. The torchbearers of fossil fuels are already making huge bets on EV charging and the mining of lithium, a key raw material used in batteries.

Chevron said in June that it had acquired 125,000 hectares of land in Texas and Arkansas for lithium extraction. BP is rapidly purchasing charging hardware from Tesla and Alpitronic. And Shell Recharge, the oil company’s charging division, is already investing in charging stations worldwide. It opened its largest charging station in Shenzhen in 2023 with 258 fast-charging stalls at just one location.

The global momentum for EVs and other forms of clean energy means oil displacement will continue to grow, just without America in the lead. So even though Washington D.C. might revel in its fossil fuel party for right now, the long term fate of that industry is pretty much decided.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/Ak4Wjx/s1/evs-displace-oil.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 10:02:37.072439

The IPO's Role in Reducing Import Dependency India's solar manufacturing ecosystem is still nascent, with imports accounting for over 70% of cell production.
Investment Thesis: A Compelling Play on India's Renewable Future Emmvee's IPO offers investors a direct stake in India's energy transition, backed by: - Policy tailwinds: Government mandates and PLI schemes ensure steady demand.
- Strong fundamentals: A 3.9 GW order book and 7.8 GW capacity provide visibility.
Recommendation: Investors seeking exposure to India's renewable energy boom should consider Emmvee's IPO.","As India races toward its ambitious 500 GW renewable energy target by 2030, solar manufacturing has emerged as a cornerstone of the nation's clean energy transition. Among the companies leading this charge is Emmvee, a Bengaluru-based solar module manufacturer poised to leverage its robust order book, advanced technology, and strategic partnerships to capitalize on government incentives and investor demand. With an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) targeting ₹2,500–₹3,000 crore, Emmvee aims to solidify its position as a key player in India's solar manufacturing boom.

Leveraging Government Incentives: A Strategic Advantage

India's push for energy self-reliance has been fueled by policies like the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) mandate, which requires solar projects to use domestically produced modules. This policy has spurred a manufacturing boom, with India adding 25.3 GW of solar module capacity in 2024 alone. Emmvee is well-positioned to benefit from these tailwinds:

- 7.8 GW of module capacity: Emmvee's production facilities, including a 4-lakh-square-foot plant in Karnataka, enable it to meet domestic demand while exporting to global markets.

- Government support: Karnataka's approval of a ₹5,495 crore investment for Emmvee underscores state-level backing for its expansion, creating 2,508 jobs and strengthening its role in the state's renewable ecosystem.

- Reducing import dependency: By scaling solar cell production to 2.94 GW—matching its module capacity—Emmvee aims to minimize reliance on imported cells, aligning with India's “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (Self-Reliant India) vision.

A Robust Order Book Anchors Growth

Emmvee's order book is a testament to its execution excellence and client trust:

- ₹5,898 crore in unexecuted orders (as of January 2025) include projects for NTPC Renewable Energy, CleanMax, and Ayana Power, with deliveries scheduled through 2026.

- KPI Green's ₹1,500 crore order: A landmark deal for 1.58 GW of high-efficiency TopCon bifacial modules, manufactured at its Karnataka facilities and deployed for a Gujarat project. This partnership highlights Emmvee's technological edge and ability to deliver at scale.

- Alignment with India's 500 GW target: Emmvee's capacity expansion plans directly support the government's goal, as its modules will power utility-scale projects, solar pumps, and rooftop installations nationwide.

Technology Leadership: TopCon Bifacial Modules

Emmvee's focus on advanced solar technologies sets it apart in a competitive market:

- TopCon bifacial modules: These high-efficiency panels, capable of capturing sunlight from both sides, boost energy yield by 10–15% compared to conventional modules. They are critical for utility-scale projects, where efficiency translates to cost savings.

- Automation and quality control: Its Karnataka facilities employ state-of-the-art automation and multi-layered quality checks, ensuring compliance with global standards. This has enabled Emmvee to penetrate markets in Europe, Africa, and North America.

Comparing Emmvee to Recent Solar IPOs: A Strong Playbook

Emmvee's IPO strategy mirrors the success of peers like Waaree Energies and Premier Energies, which leveraged robust order books and government incentives to attract investors:

- Waaree's ₹4,321 crore IPO (2024): Raised capital to build a 6 GW solar manufacturing hub in Odisha. Its stock rose 86% post-listing, buoyed by a 9 GW order book.

- Premier Energies' ₹2,830 crore IPO (2023): Oversubscribed 74x, driven by its role as the largest U.S. solar cell exporter. Its valuation surged 130% post-IPO due to export demand.

- Emmvee's edge: With a 3.9 GW order book and a 7.8 GW production capacity, Emmvee's scalability and geographic diversification (domestic and international) position it to outperform.

The IPO's Role in Reducing Import Dependency

India's solar manufacturing ecosystem is still nascent, with imports accounting for over 70% of cell production. Emmvee's IPO proceeds will fund:

1. Capacity expansion: Scaling cell production to match module output, reducing reliance on imported cells.

2. Debt reduction: Lowering interest costs to improve margins.

3. Global competitiveness: Investing in R&D for next-gen technologies like heterojunction (HJT) and perovskite cells.

Risks and Considerations

Regulatory uncertainty: Changes to import duties or ALMM criteria could impact demand.

Global oversupply: A surplus of solar panels post-2025 might pressure margins.

Execution risk: Meeting capacity expansion timelines is critical to sustaining investor confidence.

Investment Thesis: A Compelling Play on India's Renewable Future

Emmvee's IPO offers investors a direct stake in India's energy transition, backed by:

- Policy tailwinds: Government mandates and PLI schemes ensure steady demand.

- Strong fundamentals: A 3.9 GW order book and 7.8 GW capacity provide visibility.

- Technological differentiation: TopCon modules and automation give Emmvee a cost and efficiency edge.

Recommendation: Investors seeking exposure to India's renewable energy boom should consider Emmvee's IPO. Its alignment with national priorities, robust order pipeline, and global reach make it a standout candidate for long-term growth.

In conclusion, Emmvee is not just another solar manufacturer—it's a catalyst for India's clean energy independence. The IPO is a critical step toward unlocking its full potential, and investors who bet on this momentum could reap rewards as the nation transitions to a greener future.",,N,,2025-07-06 12:19:23.575440

However, in recent years, new natural gas plants have constituted a small share of new capacity additions to the overall U.S. electricity mix.
Increased natural gas demand from growing liquified natural gas exports is a primary driver for these cost increases, according to the EIA.
It’s a textbook Econ 101 example—exporting LNG abroad where natural gas prices are much higher raises demand for U.S.-produced gas.
Over same time period, 340 fewer gigawatts of clean energy would also not get built.","Remember the era of cheap natural gas? Yea, that world is gone.

Utilities and tech companies may be clamoring to build new gas-fired power plants to meet rising energy demand, but no matter how much they envision gas as a solution, there’s no escaping gas’s expensive, bad-for-the-climate reality. Anyone harboring the illusion of low-cost gas is operating as if it’s still 2015.

“I think people have in their minds that gas is a cheap way to generate power”, said Rich Powell, CEO of trade group the Clean Energy Buyers Association. “New build natural gas is not a cheap way to generate electricity.”

Today, gas’s economics are facing pressure on two fronts: Supply chain bottlenecks and workforce shortages have made it nearly impossible to source equipment for new gas-fired power plants in the near to medium term while also raising the costs of those plants. And gas as a fuel is becoming more expensive as global demand for liquified natural gas intensifies and the United States exports more of the fossil fuel instead of keeping it within our borders to meet American demand.

The shale revolution did usher in an era of cheap gas that reshaped the U.S. energy landscape, with gas overtaking coal in electricity generation around 2016. However, in recent years, new natural gas plants have constituted a small share of new capacity additions to the overall U.S. electricity mix.

In fact, since the 2018 surge, nearly every megawatt of new generation added to the grid has been clean energy—96% of new power in 2024 and 85% in 2023. That’s largely because for more than half a decade, renewables have been the cheapest sources of new electricity.

A gas buildout would look different this time

The big surge of new U.S. gas-fired power plant additions came in the early 2000s, before leveling off to a more moderate pace where the slowdown triggered several reactions that could make it hard to quickly build new gas plants today.

It turns out building gas plants is a use-it-or-lose-it skill.

Gas turbine manufacturers such as GE Vernova and Siemens Energy scaled back their production capabilities to meet lower demand, and output can’t be increased overnight. As a result, new gas turbine orders face a wait time of five to seven years before they can be delivered to utilities.

“Gas turbines were dead in 2022,” Siemens Energy North America President Rich Voorberg said at a recent conference, noting the company had been down to one customer.

Additionally, the slowdown in gas plant construction led to a brain drain, with NextEra CEO John Ketchum explaining much of the workforce that built the early 2000s boom has retired or moved to other fields, leaving behind a serious labor shortage.

Because of these factors, not only will it take years to build more natural gas-fired power plants, they’ll also be more expensive this time around. NextEra’s Ketchum estimates building a new plant today would cost three times as much as the last facility the utility built, back in 2022.

Others agree. ""We did a quote and to do the same kind of unit that had been built a few years back it would be two and a half times more today,"" Paul Sotkiewicz, president and founder of consultant E-Cubed Policy Associates.

He’s not alone in this sentiment.

""We are seeing substantial increases in the estimates for new builds, including everything from the cost of engineering, procurement and construction to the cost of equipment and materials,"" said Bobby Noble, senior program manager for Gas Turbine Research and Development at EPRI.

The fuel to run gas plants costs more too

Then there’s the other side of the coin—not only will it cost much more to build a natural gas plant in today’s world, but the fuel that plant will burn is becoming significantly more expensive. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts Henry Hub prices—the main benchmark for natural gas prices—will increase by 43% in 2025 and another 27% in 2026. Increased natural gas demand from growing liquified natural gas exports is a primary driver for these cost increases, according to the EIA.

It’s a textbook Econ 101 example—exporting LNG abroad where natural gas prices are much higher raises demand for U.S.-produced gas. And when demand goes up, so does the price.

“It is not clear how both the AI and LNG export boom, both of which need prodigious volumes of gas, can succeed without provoking price spikes,” Gas Outlook recently reported.

“The explosion of (LNG) exports has upended domestic energy markets ... and has exposed American energy markets to increased price volatility and episodes of sharply higher prices,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s energy program.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” makes the problem even worse

There’s no question U.S. electricity demand will increase in the coming years, although exactly what the rate of growth will be remains an open question. But relying on natural gas to fill the gap over at least the next five years appears to be both a foolhardy and highly expensive gamble. Instead, we should be increasing the pace of wind, solar, and storage buildout, as these technologies are currently the fastest, most affordable ways to add more power to the grid. Unfortunately, Congress just built a giant roadblock for clean energy.

The new One Big Beautiful Bill Act would repeals renewable energy incentives and puts in place overly complicated supply chain constraints, killing many of the domestic clean energy projects that had been projected to come online over the next few years. That will increase wholesale electricity costs by 74% over the next decade, according to Energy Innovation analysis. Over same time period, 340 fewer gigawatts of clean energy would also not get built.

Thus, we face a scenario where we need more power quickly, can’t get the materials or staff needed to build new gas plants that would be wildly expensive anyway, and we’re taking big chunks of fast, cheap clean energy off the table.

That’s a great blueprint for losing the AI race and making America expensive again.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68669ec79d6b635d23df1ff2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-06 09:04:47.205343

Comanche is the largest coal-burning power plant in the state, and two of its three operating units still create electricity from coal.
Even though Xcel plans to shutter Comanche’s Unit 3 within five years, it still needed to renew its Title V air permit, the document that details how much pollution the company is allowed to spew into the air.
So Nichols believes it is necessary for the state to put the closure date in the Title V permit.
“I think that emphasizes the need to find perhaps more creative ways to ensure that the Comanche coal-fired power plant retirement dates are fully set in stone through this Title V permit.”","If all goes as planned, Xcel Energy is applying for its last federal air-pollution permit for a coal-fired power plant in Colorado.

But environmentalists worry that is a big “if” as long as the Trump administration is in power, and now they are asking the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to include the Comanche Generating Station’s projected closure date of Jan. 1, 2031, in the Pueblo power plant’s latest Title V air permit.

They hope putting the date in a permit that needs Environmental Protection Agency approval will guarantee that Xcel, the largest utility company operating in Colorado, will shutter its last coal-fired power plant in the state by that deadline.

“I really want to emphasize the need to ensure that these retirement dates, which Xcel has committed to and everybody has agreed to, are established and set in stone via this Title V air permit,” said Jeremy Nichols, a senior advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity. “Right now, the federal government has launched an unprecedented assault on states like Colorado who are trying to do their part to confront the climate crisis and protect clean air and to enable a transition from coal to clean energy.”

Colorado’s utility companies have been planning for nearly two decades to shutter their coal-burning power plants and transition to cleaner alternatives, including natural gas, solar and wind power. Comanche is the largest coal-burning power plant in the state, and two of its three operating units still create electricity from coal.

Xcel is on track to shutter Comanche’s Unit 2 in September and remains committed to closing the plant’s Unit 3, which generates 750 megawatts of electricity, by January 2031, said Michelle Aguayo, a Xcel Colorado spokeswoman. Unit 1 is already closed.

“We continue to make significant progress towards our emission reduction goals approved by the state, which would require us to retire our coal units by (the end of) 2030,” Aguayo wrote in a statement. “We’re working with the administration and our states to continue delivering customers safe, clean, reliable energy while keeping our customers’ bills as low as possible.”

But President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin want the United States to continue burning coal, saying it is needed now more than ever to fuel a growing demand for electricity. That demand is being sparked, in part, by a growing reliance on artificial intelligence, which consumes massive amounts of power.

In April, Trump signed executive orders aimed at boosting the industry, calling it “America’s beautiful, clean coal,” and vowing to prevent states from curtailing its use. As part of that push, the president has ordered utilities in Michigan and Pennsylvania to keep their coal plants open even when some were on the verge of shutting down.

But Colorado officials pushed back, with Gov. Jared Polis calling the president’s orders “federal overreach.” By eliminating coal-fired power plants, Colorado will inch closer to meeting its goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change.

Now, though, Polis’ regulators are being asked to put that commitment in writing.

“We are exploring if we would have legal authority to include an enforceable retirement date for Comanche’s Unit 3 coal plant in the draft Title V operating permit — and what exactly that would mean,” said Kate Malloy, an Air Pollution Control Division spokeswoman.

Coal is a dirty substance, emitting more carbon dioxide than other energy sources and accelerating climate change. Coal also contains multiple other contaminants such as mercury, sulfur dioxide, fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide that are released into the air and are a threat to human health.

It also leaves a toxic byproduct called coal ash, which contains arsenic, lithium, selenium, cobalt and other metals, that must be dumped into landfills in the state. Millions of tons of coal ash are buried in Colorado, and at least three sites have been documented as leaking lithium and selenium into groundwater.

Even though Xcel plans to shutter Comanche’s Unit 3 within five years, it still needed to renew its Title V air permit, the document that details how much pollution the company is allowed to spew into the air.

Under the proposed permit, the amount of pollution coming from Comanche would be reduced by thousands of tons of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants, said Carrisa Money, the state health department’s Title V operating permits unit manager.

The permits are supposed to be renewed every five years. Xcel’s was last renewed in 2018.

Xcel submitted its renewal application in 2022, and now the Colorado health department is on the verge of approving it.

The state’s Air Quality Control Commission, which sets state air pollution regulations, on Tuesday held a public hearing on the permit application at which five people asked the state to do its part to slow climate change. Another 54 people submitted letters, most of which asked for the closure date to be included in the permit.

“We want to be responsive to the feedback we have received and do what’s best for Colorado, so we are working to evaluate this issue,” Malloy said in an emailed statement. “Once we have an answer, we will respond to public comments as appropriate.”

Utility companies like Xcel plan for years to shutter power plants as they replace coal with cleaner power generation. And they set goals with approvals from the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which is responsible for making sure there is enough power surging through the grid to keep people’s lights on at an affordable price.

Malloy noted that the Comanche Unit 3 retirement date is enforceable through the company’s clean energy plans, which are required by state law and were submitted with Xcel’s electric resource plan to the PUC. The Air Pollution Control Division supports clean energy plans by verifying data and sharing them for public review and input, she said.

“Even if a federally enforceable permit condition were not on the table, the state does still have oversight and enforcement authority for coal plant retirement dates,” Malloy said.

But that hasn’t stopped Trump from making his demands. So Nichols believes it is necessary for the state to put the closure date in the Title V permit.

“We urge Colorado to create a bulwark, a defense, so to speak, against the federal government’s attacks on our climate progress and our progress in transitioning away from coal,” Nichols said during Tuesday’s public hearing on the permit. “I think that emphasizes the need to find perhaps more creative ways to ensure that the Comanche coal-fired power plant retirement dates are fully set in stone through this Title V permit.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TDP-L-Environmental-Justice-RJS-0010_b359a5.jpg?w=1024&h=706,N,,2025-07-06 09:04:51.630894

The heatwave that brought 100-degree temperatures to the Philadelphia region in June also brought warnings that the air quality was unhealthy for sensitive groups.

This was not a coincidence.

Heat and sunlight are key ingredients in the reaction that creates ground-level ozone, a common air pollutant that can cause coughing, wheezing and more frequent asthma attacks.

Ozone is what’s known as a secondary pollutant. It forms from other pollutants produced by sources such as cars, trucks and power plants.

In an urban area like Philadelphia, the air already contains plenty of these precursor pollutants, said Kabindra Shakya, a professor at Villanova University who studies air quality.

“They also need one other ingredient, which is the sunlight,” Shakya said. “When we see the high heat and the sun, then that actually drives more formation of the ozone.”

Increased reactivity of compounds in the air is not the only reason that air quality tends to be worse during heat waves, said Xiaomeng Jin, a professor at Rutgers University who also studies air quality. She said that hot days can also bring poor air quality because increased air conditioner use drives up emissions from power plants.

“Besides that, during these hot days, generally you’ll see the wind speed is low, which creates stagnant conditions that can somehow trap the air pollution in these areas, so there is not so much of the transport that can clean up the air,” she said.

In the northeastern U.S., rising temperatures due to climate change are expected to increase the number of severe ozone days in the coming decades, according to the National Climate Assessment.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/07-09-2024-k-paynter-heat-wave-general-4.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 09:04:56.011870

Trump admin EPA scraps limits on climate-warming emissions, while continuing to cut funding for “crucial” mitigation and infrastructure projects.

“PublicSource is an independent nonprofit newsroom serving the Pittsburgh region. Sign up for our free newsletters.”

Sweeping federal funding cuts have halted a slate of local projects intended to reduce emissions and bolster resilience to climate change. The cuts come as U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin continues to repeal environmental regulations.

Local advocates warn that EPA rollbacks could have dire consequences for communities, especially as funding for local programs is cut and parts of the Pittsburgh region already struggle with industrial pollution.

On June 11, Zeldin moved to erase federal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants, and to strip restrictions on hazardous emissions including arsenic, mercury and lead.

The proposals are the latest in a series of deregulatory actions and funding cuts by President Trump’s administration, dubbed the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.”

The EPA contends that the moves will lower the cost of living for American families, bring jobs and manufacturing into local communities, eliminate “trillions” in regulatory costs and “unleash American energy”.

“We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion,” Zeldin said earlier this year.

The recent easing of power plant emission restrictions came after the cancellation of several EPA grants that supported local efforts to cut emissions and build climate resilience.

Cuts “devastate” environmental protection

The recent rollbacks have been met with opposition from environmental advocates who say that, if approved, the moves are certain to harm public health and the environment.

The Breathe Project called the latest EPA rollback “a gift to fossil fuel lobbyists and industry at the expense to the health and well-being of our country.”

The local nonprofit, which also represents a coalition of environmental organizations under the Breathe Collaborative, pointed to research from Harvard University that it said attributed “over 25,380 extra deaths per year of people older than 14 years old due to exposure to PM2.5 from fossil fuels.”

“Everything is getting dirtier because of the decisions being made by this administration, and I don’t think that anyone voted for that,” said David Hess, who served as secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection [DEP] in the early 2000s. Hess said EPA proposals to eliminate grants to state regulators like the DEP “will incapacitate state environmental protection efforts,” which backstop deregulation at the federal level.

The White House’s recommended cuts, detailed in a recent budget proposal, “will devastate economic development, critical infrastructure, and environmental protections across the nation,” wrote the Environmental Council of the States, a nonpartisan association of state environmental regulators, including the Pennsylvania DEP, in a May 3 letter to Zeldin.

In Pennsylvania, Hess said, that’s likely to mean fewer inspections, enforcement and permit reviews for a DEP that’s already struggling to keep up.

A coalition of environmental advocacy organizations in Pennsylvania, including PennFuture, GASP and Physicians for Social Responsibility, issued a collective statement on the EPA rollback on June 11.

By rolling back these protections, this will increase carbon pollution stemming from power plants that exacerbate the climate crisis, the coalition wrote. “These rollbacks combined with the administration’s all out assault on climate will cost lives and livelihoods of Pennsylvanians across the state.”

Dr. Stephanie Maximous, a pulmonologist and assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, said the most recent EPA rollbacks pose a “major problem” for the region, despite Allegheny County’s last coal-fired power plant being demolished in 2023. “All of the air is shared.”

Air quality is already among the worst in the country, Maximous said, pointing to a recent failing grade from the American Lung Association, but it’s also come a long way since the heyday of industry in Allegheny County. That improvement, Maximous said, is because of regulation. Now, “we’re going in the wrong direction,” she said.

“Everybody in the Pittsburgh region and Allegheny County stands to have worsened health outcomes” due to the EPA rollbacks, Maximous said. “It puts our local residents at risk.”

EPA cuts stall climate resiliency, green workforce projects

As the Trump administration moves to strip limits on climate-warming emissions, the EPA has clawed back funding for projects intended to address the local impacts of climate change, including landslides, flooding and associated workforce development and cleanup efforts.

The EPA “abruptly cancelled” a $930,000 grant to the Allegheny County Health Department, according to spokesperson Ronnie Das. The grant was intended to fund 10 new green infrastructure stormwater projects aimed at reducing flood damage in designated environmental justice communities, including Braddock, Homestead, Swissvale and Wilmerding. It was also set to finance litter cleanups in 10 local communities. The initiative was a partnership among the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering and two local nonprofits, Landforce and Allegheny Cleanways.

News of the cancellation came in late March, days before work was scheduled to begin on a project aimed at mitigating stormwater damage at the Westgate Condominiums in Wilkinsburg.

The county does not plan to continue the project after losing “crucial funding,” according to Das, who added that the funds “may have been cut because of the words ‘environmental justice’ being attached to it.”

Separately, Allegheny County lost $4.1 million that was awarded in early January by the U.S. Department of Transportation for the installation of 150 new electric vehicle charging stations. The grant was set to “accelerate the transition to clean energy and promote sustainable transportation across our region,” U.S. Rep. Summer Lee said at the time.

That funding was matched with an additional $2 million from Duquesne Light Company, which, along with other project partners including the City of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny County Airport Authority, the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and 14 local municipalities, are “considering options” to continue the project, according to Brittany Prishak, sustainability director for Allegheny County.

Federal efficiency or government ‘plundering?’

In early May, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, slashed more than $6.4 million in federal funding to local organizations when the EPA terminated the Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program, which was part of the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

On June 11, Lee and Congressman Chris Deluzio, D-Aspinwall, wrote to Zeldin at the EPA in response to ongoing federal funding cuts:

“[DOGE] is plundering our government and dismantling important community-led public and environmental health initiatives, workforce development, and outdoor education programming,” the representatives wrote, while requesting that the EPA restore the grants.

Allegheny Cleanways, a local nonprofit focused on illegal dumpsite remediation, had signed a contract for $224,500 before the EPA canceled the grant. It would have been the single largest influx of funding for the organization, said Executive Director Caily Grube, and would have supported the organization’s land and water cleanups and education programs for two years.

The organization has been hit twice more by federal funding cuts through partnerships with Allegheny County and the City of McKeesport.

When they were approved, “me and my staff were literally dancing,” Grube said. Now, the organization is planning for “fiscal gymnastics.”

On June 18, a federal judge ruled the EPA’s termination of the Thriving Communities grants was unlawful. The EPA is reviewing the decision.

“We’re half assuming it will get axed again,” Grube said.

Across the region, a number of other grants have been canceled by the EPA, including:

$1 million to the City of McKeesport to address environmental issues including air pollution, heat island effects, residential brownfields and stormwater management.

$4.9 million to the Energy Innovation Center Institute to support workforce development in the water utilities.

$15 million to Landforce for workforce development in land stewardship.

More local organizations, including New Sun Rising, the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community, 412 Food Rescue and Riverwise, had all been relying on funding from the Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program for projects that improve public health initiatives across the Pittsburgh region, the representatives wrote in their letter.

“This Administration is yet again breaking promises to our region. The EPA has long been a lifeline for so many communities in Pennsylvania. From helping provide clean drinking water, to commerce, to recreation, and more — our prosperity relies on clean and healthy initiatives funded by the EPA.”

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-06 11:32:14+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Contributor: We still rely on gasoline. Why is California adding to the cost and the pollution?,Michael A. Mische,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-07-06/california-gasoline-costs-refineries-pollution-imports,"Despite these realities, California energy policy is leading to the dismantling of the critical infrastructure that supports this essential system.
Stunningly, because that pollution happens over international waters, it doesn’t get counted by the California Air Resources Board.
Closing a refinery in California and importing more fuel causes a net increase in pollution.
Yet we’ve built an energy model that depends on importing foreign oil and, now, a growing dependency on foreign-supplied gasoline.
California will be forced to source more and more fuel from overseas — at greater environmental and economic cost.","California is a state of contradictions. We lead the nation in environmental regulation, tout our clean energy goals with pride and champion a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. Yet despite this green image, our economy — and daily life — still very much run on oil and gas.

Fossil fuels account for roughly 8% of California’s $3 trillion economy — but that’s the first 8%. “If you don’t get that first 8%,” I tell my students, “You don’t get the rest of our economy.” Oil powers everything from trucks to tractors to construction equipment. Without it, you can’t build roads or bridges or get goods to grocery stores. Without refined petroleum products, you don’t make cement, steel, plastics or even the lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles.

Despite these realities, California energy policy is leading to the dismantling of the critical infrastructure that supports this essential system. Our state has lost more than 30 refineries in the last few decades. We are now down to just nine major gasoline-producing facilities, and two more are scheduled to close in the coming months, Phillips 66 in Los Angeles and Valero in the Bay Area. Those two plants represent 284,000 barrels of daily production and account for nearly 18% of the state’s total refining capacity.

California sits atop one of the largest untapped reserves in the world, the Monterey Shale. But because of policy and regulation, we import most of our oil — including from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Guyana and Ecuador. California has also imported oil from Russia and Venezuela. Ironically, we have among the world’s cleanest refining standards, but we import fuel from places with lower environmental and labor protections.

All of this is enabled by a supply chain that’s more vulnerable than most realize. We have no major pipelines bringing oil to California. We rely on ships — many from Asia — that take 30 to 40 days to deliver fuel. These foreign tankers pollute at staggering rates. Stunningly, because that pollution happens over international waters, it doesn’t get counted by the California Air Resources Board. Closing a refinery in California and importing more fuel causes a net increase in pollution. And adding to our reliance on foreign oil is risky when global instability is rising.

This isn’t just a self-inflicted energy crisis in the making. It’s also a national security issue.

Military bases in California, Nevada and Arizona depend heavily on in-state refineries for specialized aviation fuel and other petroleum products essential to operations. As refineries shut down, the supply chain narrows, increasing reliance on imports from Asia and elsewhere. These gaps create unacceptable logistical and strategic risks for U.S. military readiness in the western states.

And remember, there are estimated to be hundreds of millions of barrels of accessible oil under our feet. Yet we’ve built an energy model that depends on importing foreign oil and, now, a growing dependency on foreign-supplied gasoline.

This isn’t just unsustainable. It’s also borderline irresponsible.

California’s energy transition is inevitable — but how we get there matters. We can’t pretend fossil fuels are already gone. We still need them for the economy, for mobility, for national security and for the working people who can’t afford a $60,000 electric vehicle or a solar roof.

We have the tools, talent and resources to lead a responsible energy transition, one that leverages our in-state production, balances environmental stewardship with economic pragmatism and protects our most vulnerable communities along the way.

But we have to be honest about where we are. And right now, fossil fuels still power the Golden State.

Especially because of coming refinery rules and a new tax taking effect in July, Californians are set to pay the highest gas prices in the nation. Our prices are inflated by a web of taxes, fees and boutique regulations that has grown thicker and more expensive over time. Even if oil dropped to $0 per barrel and refining were free, Californians would still be paying about $1.82 a gallon at the pump — $1.64 of that from state taxes and fees, plus 18 cents in federal gas tax.

According to CalTrans, Californians drive about 1,200 miles a month. If you’re a working-class Californian and gas goes up 50 cents per gallon, that adds about $500 in annual fuel costs. And because you pay for that with after-tax dollars, you’d need to earn at least an extra $750 just to cover it.

That matters to a construction worker commuting 60 miles a day in a pickup truck. It matters to a single mom cleaning homes across the city or a physical therapist driving to house calls. Most of these people can’t easily trade in their vehicles for Teslas and dodge gasoline hikes. Consumer analysis as noted in CalMatters indicates that the majority of EVs are bought by higher-income Californians living in areas such as Atherton, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and Mountain View.

The people hit hardest by rising gasoline prices are the ones least able to afford alternatives. For most Californians, there is no viable mass transit available. People are just stuck spending more and more of their income on the gas-powered vehicles their lives depend on. Our state’s policies punish people for not being able to adapt quickly enough to a green future that’s not yet built. It’s a regressive tax masquerading as environmental action.

Until California realistically bridges the gap between aspirational climate goals and equitable policy execution, the state’s lofty environmental vision will continue to rest uneasily on the shoulders of its most vulnerable.

The new state excise tax adding about 2 cents a gallon went into effect July 1, and CARB is pushing for a new low-carbon fuel standard that could add and potentially major costs to the prices of gasoline and diesel fuel. No one knows exactly how much — not even the board proposing the rules.

At a recent Assembly oversight hearing, CARB officials were asked if they analyzed their regulations for consumer impacts. Their answer: We don’t calculate that. The room went silent. It was a stunning admission — regulators pushing policy without running the math.

No wonder we’re seeing an exodus of working families. By layering new and unclear costs on top of an already overstretched system, CARB and other regulators are creating what could become a self-inflicted economic shock.

And for what? Not environmental progress. California will be forced to source more and more fuel from overseas — at greater environmental and economic cost. By relying on polluting sources and carbon-intensive shipping, we’ve simply outsourced our emissions to other countries. California is not reducing emissions. We are exporting them.

If this sounds reckless, it is. But more than that, it’s unjust.

These policies are not burdening the wealthy. They’re crushing the working class. They’re forcing families to choose between gas and groceries, between job access and housing stability. They’re also outsourcing jobs overseas.

And they’re being implemented by unelected bureaucrats who, by their own admission in testimony before California lawmakers, haven’t calculated the real-world impact.

The people of California deserve better than this. They deserve honesty, transparency and policy grounded in economic realism, not ideological fantasy and environmental dogma. If recent and coming changes become a tipping point, it won’t be because of some unpredictable global event. It will be because we chose not to look before we leaped.

The path forward demands a pause, a recalibration and a return to common sense. Otherwise, this summer could mark not just another price hike — but the day we began losing control of our energy future.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b946cf3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+283/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2F1e%2Fb520c71b46b4b87e9f2f1bbc4bfd%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2222214835,N,,2025-07-06 08:03:21.050177

If the federal government finalizes the budget reconciliation bill in play, pro-consumer voices in Minnesota warn the changes will not be friendly to monthly bills for energy customers.

The analysts pointed to new findings from the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, which looked at provisions in the Senate version from this week. It said the plan would cause Minnesotans' home electricity costs to rise by 28 percent over the next decade.

Annie Levenson-Falk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, said it is because Republican lawmakers are poised to eliminate clean energy tax credits while expanding new oil and gas leasing.

""If we can't build as much wind and solar and renewables, then we're not just going to be building more gas plants, but running inefficient, more costly gas plants, more than we would have to,"" Levenson-Falk explained.

Levenson-Falk pointed out many Minnesotans are already struggling with utility costs, and the advancement of cleaner energy sources has prevented things from getting worse. Fossil fuel-linked groups are cheering the proposed measure, including America's Power, which argued incentives for renewables are no longer needed and they are pushing out energy sources such as coal prematurely.

The debates remain at the forefront with energy demand predicted to spike in the coming years. Levenson-Falk noted the new report showed transitioning back to a fossil-fuel vision would lead to a slower rollout of additional power capacity.

""Our power plants are old and they need to be upgraded or replaced,"" Levenson-Falk stressed.

Both nations have established a joint “Green and Digital Transformation Hub” in Indonesia, which represents a strategic data-based approach to solve shared problems while using their strengths to create an alliance based on sustainable development and global leadership.

The renewable energy portion of Indonesia’s energy mix stands at 14.1 percent during early 2025, while the government maintains a reduced target of 17–20 percent due to funding limitations and technological problems, and infrastructure restrictions. The first implementation phase of the RUPTL 2025–2034 renewable capacity expansion focuses on fossil fuels because green projects face bankability risks, and policy inertia exists. The “Making Indonesia 4.0” initiative emphasizes the immediate requirement to develop digital capabilities among workers, yet vocational training and digital infrastructure development remain behind regional standards. The national targets for decarbonization and industrial value chain progression face risk from these existing deficits.

The German economy possesses top-tier abilities in green technology alongside smart manufacturing and dual vocational training systems. The Fraunhofer Institutes, along with Mittelstand firms, excel in applied research and precision engineering, and Germany has invested more than €200 billion from public and private sources in clean energy and digitalization initiatives since 2020. The German economy decreased by 0.2 percent in 2024, which resulted in a second annual recession, and manufacturing value added decreased by 3 percent because of expensive energy costs and international market competition, and the electric vehicle industry. The economy’s diminishing size demonstrates that gradual changes are insufficient, which leads German industry to search for collaborative platforms to achieve growth through sustainable means.

The proposed Green and Digital Transformation Hub in Indonesia serves to address multiple interconnected challenges. The proposed centralized campus, located within an Indonesian industrial zone, would become possible through combined funding from the German Development Bank (KfW), together with Indonesian state funds and private sector investments. The Hub would perform four essential functions through its establishment. The first function would include German Fraunhofer researchers and Indonesian BRIN scientists operating together at applied R&D centers to develop renewable energy technologies such as tropical solar modules and small-scale pumped storage systems, along with carbon capture projects. The vocational training at the Hub will combine German apprenticeships with Indonesian polytechnic education to train technicians who can install and maintain solar farms and wind turbines, as well as smart manufacturing equipment. The incubator program will enable German cleantech startups to test their innovations in the 270 GW power market of Indonesia and Indonesian digital ventures to connect with German networks and access capital. The Hub would establish a Policy Dialogue Forum to bring together policymakers and regulators who will align Indonesian regulatory standards for feed-in tariffs and land use, and data governance with EU best practices to decrease investment risk and improve project approval speed.

Several challenges must be acknowledged. The construction of green infrastructure in developing markets faces significant financial barriers since the energy transition in Indonesia needs more than $100 billion before 2030, while climate finance commitments remain underutilized. The currency volatility and policy changes demonstrated through the 2025 target revision reduce investor trust in emerging markets. German vocational training methods need to be adapted to match Indonesian academic traditions through joint curriculum development and credential recognition systems. The process of achieving coordination among different government entities, along with private organizations and agencies, faces possible delays from bureaucratic procedures. Environmental and social considerations, including community land rights and ecological sensitivities in island provinces, need established stakeholder engagement protocols to prevent new challenges from arising.

A steering board with senior foreign ministry officials as chairs would lead the Hub’s governance model, while technical committees composed of energy ministry representatives alongside industry ministry representatives and education ministry representatives, and finance ministry representatives would provide support. A transparent monitoring system that uses benchmarked indicators such as renewable megawatt deployment and the number of graduated apprentices, patented technologies, and regulatory changes would maintain accountability. The implementation of public–private dialogue platforms with civil society advisory panels would incorporate local views, while an integrated communication strategy using social media, along with biannual progress reports, would increase public support.

The Green and Digital Transformation Hub provides Indonesia with a proven method to reach its 2025 targets by lowering coal electricity usage below 50 percent while boosting manufacturing export growth by 15 percent per year. The Hub provides Germany with a strategic opportunity to transfer its cleantech expertise and rebuild its manufacturing sector while establishing an example for international climate partnership models. This initiative establishes a strategic alliance through infrastructure development, coordination with human capital investment and technology incubation, and policy harmonization, which creates mutual accountability and shared innovation between the two nations for a low-carbon, digitally empowered future.

The state is showing a dedication to sustainable farming measures by allocating $223 million for agricultural practices that stop pollutants and sediment disturbances that lead to runoff into the Chesapeake Bay.

It is a $16 million increase over the last fiscal year, leading to the fourth year of increasing funding from the state. The program helps farmers in the commonwealth to implement projects that conserve water, help soil health through cover crops, and other sustainability goals. It is part of a larger, multistate effort to improve the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay.

“This unprecedented funding underscores Virginia’s strong commitment to environmental stewardship and agricultural resilience,” said Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Stefanie Taillon in a statement. “Investing in voluntary conservation practices is one of the most effective ways we can protect our waterways, support farmers and meet our Chesapeake Bay restoration goals.”

Farmers can apply for up to $300,000 in fiscal year 2026 to cost-share one of over 60 projects, including stream cattle exclusion zones, cover crops, and animal waste control facilities.

“So sometimes they would be implementing a practice, but this is kind of taking their practice to the next level from a work party perspective, and the payment structure is set up in a way to try and incentivize or offset the financial disadvantage of implementing rye over a legume for example,” said James Martin, Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation’s division of soil and water conservation. Rye is less attractive to farmers as a cover crop because it spreads into other crops.

Martin said it is important to bring farmers to the table on these goals because they understand it is a cost to them to implement these projects. He said he has been pleased with the General Assembly’s investment in cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay.

“If we fail to meet our agricultural commitments in the Chesapeake Bay by 2027 there’s a possibility that the secretaries of agriculture and the secretaries of natural resources would mandate the implementation of nutrient management on crops,” Martin said.

Over a decade ago, Virginia joined other states in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Later, the General Assembly implemented a law that beefed up the requirements for the state to reduce its amount of pollutants running out of its waterways into the Bay.

There are questions around how the agreement will be impacted with the Trump administration proposing major cuts to the EPA. After a brief funding pause, many of the dollars already allocated by Congress were released to the Bay cleanup programs. It is uncertain what the budget for the projects will be in the next year.

But should a SALT cap raise — or a host of similar bugaboos — be a dealbreaker for the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill?
Even in watered-down, twisted-out form, Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill made for yet one more.","As I write this, House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is talking ... and talking ... and talking, using his Cory Booker moment to stall the final passage of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Act.

He may be helping its passage. Vice President JD Vance said one GOP Congressman just texted him, “I was undecided on the bill but then I watched Hakeem Jeffries performance and now I’m a firm yes.”

But as of my deadline, which was early last week so Gazette staff could have Friday off to celebrate (the real) No Kings Day, I can’t confirm the BBB’s passage. As I type, Jeffries is still using his “magic minute,” a customary privilege of party leaders to speak for as long as they wish.

Trump racks up wins

But as I file this column, I can confirm President Donald Trump is hours away from his scheduled rally at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. He’ll surely talk about his victories of late, and he’s got a bucketful from just the last two weeks: Bunker-busting kabooms that impaled Iran’s nuclear capabilities, high praise from the NATO secretary-general for convincing most members to up their defense spending and a fistful of favorable Supreme Court rulings.

Ope, there’s more: new trade deals, a stock market that has roared back from tariff panic, gas prices back at 2021 levels right before a big summer travel weekend, zero illegal migrants released into the country for a second month in a row and a jobs report that that beat expectations for the third month in a row.

Also, he’s kicking off a yearlong celebration to mark the 250th year of the greatest country in the history of the world.

And yes, he’ll probably boast his big, beautiful win in getting the Big Beautiful Bill passed, even if it hasn’t happened by the time he steps on that stage.

By the time you read this, the Big Beautiful Bill will likely have passed. It needed to. Without it, the income tax cuts we have all enjoyed for the last eight years — whether some admit or even realize it — would vanish. Our taxes would have gone up collectively by trillions of dollars, stifling the economy and likely triggering a recession. No one has ever raised taxes and watched an economic boom follow.

Bill is a necessary mess

Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of things about the Big Beautiful Bill I dislike. I don’t like that only eight years after the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped state and local tax (SALT) deductions at $10,000, the BBB raises that cap to $40,000. That will enable high-tax states and metropolitan areas to keep their taxes high — or raise them even higher if up to $30,000 of that tax burden can once again be deducted from their residents’ federal taxes. We Iowans didn’t set fiscally sane tax rates just to see Californians’ federal obligations offset by their own tax-and-spend stupidity.

But should a SALT cap raise — or a host of similar bugaboos — be a dealbreaker for the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill? No. Even worse than all that would be if our taxes shoot up and the economy sputters, not to mention a number of other unfortunate side effects.

The $10,000 SALT cap added to the 2017 tax cut bill cost the bill 12 GOP congressional votes, all from Republicans in high-tax blue states. At the time, House Republicans had a 45-seat advantage over Democrats and could afford to lose those votes. In the current Congress, House Republicans could only lose three from their own party and still get the bill passed. (In a strategy move that surprises absolutely no one, Democrats in both chambers were united in opposition.)

So they had to negotiate. They had to compromise and give just enough members just enough of what they wanted, including a whole load of stuff that plenty of people don’t like.

Politicians wield power to serve interests

Don’t go assuming that is unusual. It’s what politicians do. They leverage their influence hoping to serve the interests of themselves and their constituents.

Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., for example, said he couldn’t get behind the Senate version of the Big Beautiful Bill, which hikes the SALT cap increase to $40,000 but drops it back to $10,000 in the year 2030.

""I need $40K for my constituents, and it has to be $40K forever,” LaLota told Axios on June 30.

I, as an Iowan, having stated my dislike for large SALT deductions, certainly don’t like that. But I understand it. If I hated myself enough to live and pay taxes in New York, I’d probably favor LaLota’s leveraging for a higher SALT deduction cap. (How LaLota voted in the end is something we’ll find out past my deadline.)

That’s the standard in all deliberative bodies — members wield their power and leaders let them to the extent that they must in order to accomplish the overall goal.

Politicians flex

Look at what happened in the Iowa Legislature not two months ago. A group of 12 state senators pledged to not vote on the required state budget unless legislation prohibiting eminent domain for private companies was brought up for a vote. Those 12 senators leveraged their collective power for the sake of the interests of constituent landowners and their environmentalist allies who were adamantly opposed to their land being seized by a carbon capture and storage company for a pipeline. The leverage worked -- the eminent domain bill passed, as did the state budget, and everyone got to go home.

Yes, the anti-pipeline bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds, opening a tiny window at the end of a still-unlikely tunnel for Summit Carbon Solutions’ and ethanol leaders’ hopes to construct a carbon pipeline in Iowa.

But Reynolds and legislators who had opposed the eminent domain bill were acting on behalf of constituents, too, and their interests: avoiding the unintended blocking of future, desirable projects. It’s nothing to do with keeping the former employers of one particular state senator with gubernatorial aspirations happy and their checkbooks wide-open. (Depending on whom you ask, at least.)

While we’re on the subject, one thing that helps make the carbon pipeline industry especially lucrative is tax credits — specifically, the 45Q tax credits that offer between $85 and $180 per ton, depending on the method of capture. If Summit captures 18 million tons of carbon annually as they claim is their plan, that adds up to between $1.5 billion and $3.2 billion in incentives. Ka-ching.

Everyone loves spending bills when they suit

Democrats in Washington, D.C., and their supporters decry those tax credits as part of the bill’s big, beautiful giveaway to corporations and the wealthy. But they certainly didn’t object to those same handouts when passing former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which increased the values of those very 45Q tax credits to their present amounts. (And increased the deficit and raised the national debt, but those were minor details, apparently.)

That’s why their arguments fall flat. The game they loathe is the same game they love when their people hold the gavel and the pen.

They condemn Republicans for trying to prevent trillions in tax increases, claiming it will increase the deficit and national debt. (Economic growth from BBB complicates their gloomy forecast.) But when Republicans try to cut a tiny fraction of spending, and they go ballistic and claim people will die.

Big corporations shouldn’t get tax giveaways, they insist. But Congress must protect these tax credits for things like renewable energy upgrades (from which big corporations will profit.)

OK, then.

That’s why there’s always so much to spending bills, “big and beautiful” or not. Everyone has their own interests. The federal government is an enticing machine for serving those interests.

Bob’s interest is in passing the bill so his taxes don’t go up. Carl’s interest is seeing it fail so the wealthy pay more (even though Bob will, too.)

Roger wants to keep residential solar tax credits alive so he can install panels on his roof. Denise is a server at a restaurant who wants tips to become tax-exempt. Jared desires his overtime pay not to be taxed so he can still take more home even after it bumped him into a higher tax bracket.

Our legislators are the ones trying to represent all those interests while compromising with colleagues representing other, often competing ones. It’s a process.

Some GOP holdouts demanded “perfect“ at the expense of ”good.“ In representative government, there’s no such thing. Especially when the constituency is so polarized and when looming consequences include a big tax increase.

Democrats continue down their road to nowhere

Unfortunately, the Democrat left doesn’t even want for perfect to be the enemy of good. They want to make Trump the enemy of everything. They’re failing at doing so.

Polls show their base is getting accustomed to failure. A record number of Republican voters, on the other hand, are stoked at all this winning. Even in watered-down, twisted-out form, Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill made for yet one more.

Whenever it actually passed, that is. As I turn this in, Minority Leader Jeffries is still talking.

These cuts could increase energy costs, pollution, and threaten investments in clean energy projects.

Indiana has already benefited from clean energy tax credits, with significant investments and job creation in electric vehicle and carbon capture projects.

On May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m grateful that Rep. Erin Houchin was one of 21 representatives who signed a letter in support of clean energy tax credits but disappointed that the House advanced this legislation without these credits.

These cuts will hurt Indiana if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution and threaten growing economic investments we’ve seen in Indiana.

Federal tax credits — designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. — have been working for us locally and around the country. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, our district, Indiana’s 9th, has benefited in at least three ways:

Columbus got $100 million in investments that helped create 1883 jobs at Toyota to build electric vehicles. Bedford got $45 million in investments for making electric vehicles at GM. And Mitchell got $991 million in investments for carbon capture and storage in cement making at Heidelberg Materials and Mitsubishi.

This legislation has overwhelmingly benefited Republican-held districts — 78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP. But that success story could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

Trump administration proposals to repeal federal policies and freeze funding have cost America nearly 42,000 announced jobs — including 1,600 in Indiana — and stopped more than 60 announced clean energy projects representing more than $57 billion in investment.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Households and local businesses will take a huge hit. A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades like rooftop solar is a blow to Indiana residents, who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills. Incentives have made it easier for homeowners to install solar panels and save money. They have also helped stabilize America’s power grid. But those benefits — and the local businesses that depend on them — are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts.

On the other hand, if Congress protects clean energy tax credits, it would be a huge boost to Indiana’s economy over the next decade. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will add 524,000 jobs in Indiana and boost Hoosiers’ income by $37 billion. That’s not hypothetical — that’s real money and real livelihoods.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits. Four Republican senators sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

Clean energy tax credits are beneficial for Indiana! Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. Please join me in urging Sens. Todd Young and Jim Banks to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect these tax credits. Email them through their websites or call them at (202) 224-3121.

Raising concern about substandard solar panels, Mostafa Al Mahmud said the import of low-quality solar products is creating chaos in the market. Effective verification and control systems in customs and BSTI is important to flourish this sector, he noted.

The renewable energy sector is not only a solution for power generation for Bangladesh, but it also has the potential to create millions of new green jobs, he said.

According to iVT, Oxa, the brains behind autonomous driving software, has teamed up with Bradshaw EV, a trusted manufacturer and supplier of industrial electric vehicles. The two companies are launching a new wave of driverless electric vehicles. Designed to optimize operations in factories, airports, and solar farms, the EVs are already fully equipped and ready to go.

The Oxa-Bradshaw collaboration is starting with two autonomous vehicles: the Bradshaw T800 tow tractor and the Club Car Carryall 500 utility vehicle. Both come fitted with the advanced Oxa Driver self-driving software and are built for real-world industrial work.

The Bradshaw T800 has an eight-ton towing capability for off-highway light logistics applications. It can move autonomously across massive warehouse floors, distribution centers, campuses, airports, and other sites. Meanwhile, the Carryall 500 is designed for autonomous asset monitoring and data collection. It is fully equipped for use in industrial plants, solar farms, and other large environments.

These driverless EVs also don't just move cargo or collect data; they free human workers from repetitive or hazardous jobs, reduce operating costs, and help companies accomplish more without burning more fuel, making them smart and cost-efficient.

Their built-in inductive charging and rugged off-highway design allow them to run longer, cleaner, and with far less maintenance than traditional vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

With the industrial sector contributing more than 3 billion tons of heat-trapping gases each year, innovations like driverless EVs can help slash this huge number. By replacing gas-powered fleets with clean, autonomous electric vehicles, industries reduce air and noise pollution as well as energy and health costs.

Oxa CEO Gavin Jackson, per iTV, called the partnership a major step toward ""safe, reliable self-driving solutions."" Together, Oxa and Bradshaw aim to deliver mobility automation that provides real productivity gains for industries that need them most.

This project aligns with a broader effort to make transportation cleaner and smarter across all sectors. One company in Dubai is pushing the freight transport revolution with a fleet of self-driving electric trucks. Hesai and Westwell have collaborated to develop all-electric trucks for more efficient logistics in ports and cargo terminals. Even Apple is contributing to the shift with its efforts to develop self-driving cars.

As more sectors adopt automation, innovations like the Oxa-Bradshaw EVs signal a shift in logistics operations and how industries can lower their negative impact on the environment.

For those exploring lower-impact travel alternatives, there are now more EV options available. The future of transport isn't just electric. It's autonomous — and already moving.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bradshaw-T800-Driven-by-Oxa-.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 06:02:47.882621

Eskasoni Cold Logistics stores frozen, cold and dry goods, which can include anything from satellite dishes to blueberries, but the bulk of its storage is frozen fish products.

Thanks to the recent addition of more than 1,300 ground-mounted solar panels through a government-funded solar energy initiative, up to 40 per cent of the facility's energy use is offset by solar power. The project was celebrated with a ceremonial ribbon cutting on June 23.

""The fact that we're just using natural sunlight to drive power is a good thing,"" said co-owner Jim Gillis.

Gillis and his brother Allan purchased the facility in 2017 in partnership with the Eskasoni First Nation. Steve Parsons, the CEO of Eskasoni's corporate division and the lead on the community's renewable energy efforts, says the project resulted from another partnership between Eskasoni and Natural Forces Solar, an independent renewable energy power producer in Halifax.

That partnership qualified the storage facility for the solar panel installation under the province's Green Choice Program, which aims to help large-scale electricity customers transition to clean energy.

According to Eskasoni's corporate division, the 583-kilowatt solar system was the result of a $1.85-million investment, with $1.1 million from Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada, $570,000 from Eskasoni, $128,000 from the province and $72,000 from Efficiency Nova Scotia.

Parsons said the facility can store up to 2.3 million kilograms of frozen fish products, which requires a constant temperature of about –23 C. The facility also provides live lobster storage and can hold up to 113,000 kilograms at once. The lobsters require a constant filtered water flow at about 3 C to remain dormant.

Parsons said the cost to run those systems adds up, so the solar energy project will make a big difference on the monthly bill.

""Based on the estimates and our typical, average sun patterns, we should be able to save 35 to 40 per cent on an ongoing, consistent basis,"" he said.

That represents about $8,000 a month, Parsons said, noting the project has created jobs in the community as well, with 10 band members trained as certified installers of solar ground-mount systems.

Gillis, who is also general manager of Live Stor Sydney, which operates out of the facility, said the solar system was only brought online a few months ago, but it's already making a difference on the power bill and the building's efficiency.

The facility still relies on Nova Scotia Power for at least 60 per cent of its energy consumption, but Parsons said he hopes there will be more clean energy opportunities for the facility in the future.

Gillis is also excited about what lies ahead.

""I know it's new, the solar panel systems are starting to crop up. I see them a lot on houses now,"" he said.

Flood Mitigation Infrastructure Texas's drainage systems were overwhelmed by rainfall that exceeded their design capacity.
Risks and Considerations Regulatory Delays: Permitting infrastructure projects can take years.
The Bottom Line: Act Now or Pay Later The Texas floods are a harbinger of disasters to come.","The catastrophic floods that ravaged Texas's Hill Country in July 2025 were a stark wake-up call. With rainfall exceeding 12 inches per hour, the Guadalupe River surged to 39 feet—its highest recorded level—submerging neighborhoods, destroying infrastructure, and claiming over 24 lives. The disaster underscored a grim reality: America's aging infrastructure is catastrophically unprepared for climate-driven disasters. For investors, this crisis is a call to action—one that demands capital be directed toward building a more resilient future. Here's how to profit from the urgent need to fortify communities against floods, storms, and rising temperatures.

The Texas Floods: A Blueprint for Vulnerabilities

The floods exposed three critical weaknesses:

1. Grid Insecurity: Over 2,600 households lost power as aging transmission lines failed under floodwaters.

2. Drainage Failure: Outdated systems were overwhelmed, turning urban areas into lakes.

3. Early Warning Deficiencies: A failed river gauge left officials blind to the crisis.

These failures cost Texas over $10 billion in damages—and that's just the start. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave Texas a “C” for infrastructure in 2025, citing systemic underinvestment in energy systems, transit, and flood mitigation. With climate change intensifying extreme weather, these vulnerabilities are no longer theoretical risks but present-day realities.

The Climate Resilience Investment Opportunity

The urgency to rebuild better—and smarter—is creating multi-billion-dollar markets. Here are the sectors to watch:

1. Grid Hardening & Smart Energy Systems

The Texas floods revealed how fragile energy grids are to climate shocks. Outdated power lines and substations failed catastrophically, leaving communities in darkness. Solutions are already in motion:

- Entergy Texas's $137M Grid Resilience Plan: Burying power lines and fortifying substations to withstand floods and wildfires.

- Microgrids and Distributed Energy: Companies like Tesla and NextEra Energy are leading the shift to decentralized systems that can operate independently during outages.

Investment Play:

- Stocks: Consider utility companies with grid modernization pipelines, such as NextEra Energy (NEE) or Dominion Energy (D).

- ETFs: The iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (IGF) offers diversified exposure to energy and utility projects.

2. Flood Mitigation Infrastructure

Texas's drainage systems were overwhelmed by rainfall that exceeded their design capacity. The solution lies in “gray” and “green” infrastructure:

- Gray Infrastructure: Levees, dams, and storm surge barriers. The $31 billion Ike Dike project aims to protect Texas's coast from hurricanes, but similar projects are needed inland.

- Green Infrastructure: Wetland restoration, permeable pavements, and AI-optimized rain gardens. Firms like AECOM and Tetra Tech are pioneers in these solutions.

Investment Play:

- Stocks: AECOM (ACM) and Jacobs Engineering (JEC) are engineering giants with flood resilience expertise.

- Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Look for municipal bonds funding projects like Harris County's $2.5 billion flood control plan.

3. Predictive Analytics & Emergency Tech

The failed Guadalupe River gauge was a life-threatening oversight. New technologies are filling this gap:

- AI-Driven Early Warning Systems: IBM's Weather Company uses predictive analytics to model flood risks in real time.

- Drones & Satellite Surveillance: DJI and American Robotics deploy drones to assess damage and map flood zones faster than ever.

Investment Play:

- Stocks: IBM (IBM) and NVIDIA (NVDA) are leaders in AI and data infrastructure.

- ETFs: The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Communication Services ETF (XLO) includes tech firms advancing emergency comms.

4. Parametric Insurance & Climate Finance

Traditional insurance models are buckling under climate costs. Parametric policies—triggered by measurable events like rainfall thresholds—are rising to meet demand. Swiss Re and Munich Re are pioneers, but startups like FloodFlash are democratizing access.

Investment Play:

- ETFs: The SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE) includes firms innovating in climate insurance.

- Green Bonds: Municipal bonds for flood mitigation projects offer tax-free yields while funding resilience.

Risks and Considerations

Regulatory Delays: Permitting infrastructure projects can take years.

Cost Overruns: Texas's history of 20–30% cost overruns on projects demands due diligence.

Tech Consolidation: Early-stage firms may be acquired, limiting upside for equity holders.

The Bottom Line: Act Now or Pay Later

The Texas floods are a harbinger of disasters to come. The ASCE estimates $5 trillion is needed to modernize U.S. infrastructure by 2029—a timeline shrinking as storms grow fiercer. Investors ignoring this trend risk being left behind.

Actionable Strategy:

- Allocate 30% to grid hardening (utilities, smart energy tech).

- Deploy 40% to flood mitigation (infrastructure firms, green bonds).

- Reserve 30% for emergency tech and insurance (AI, parametric policies).

The time to invest in climate resilience is now. Those who build defenses against today's floods will profit from tomorrow's safer, smarter world.

Ethanol saves every American family money at the pump and helps build a more resilient, self-reliant energy future.","The following editorial is by Erik Huschitt, President of WBFA.

As Americans prepare to celebrate our nation’s independence this Fourth of July, a new report

offers a timely reminder. American-made ethanol is helping us move toward greater energy

independence while saving consumers billions of dollars at the pump.

A recent analysis by energy expert George Hoekstra finds that ethanol use results in more than

$50 billion in annual fuel savings for American drivers. That is equivalent to about 39 cents per

gallon. You’re saving nearly 40 cents per gallon every time you fill up thanks to ethanol, without

sacrificing your engine or reliability.

How? Ethanol is a high-octane, low-cost fuel component blended into nearly every gallon of

gasoline sold today. Hoekstra’s study shows that producing the same octane level using only

traditional petroleum refining methods would be more than four times as expensive as using

ethanol. Eliminating ethanol from the U.S. fuel mix would significantly increase refining costs,

driving up fuel prices nationwide.

Consequently, for drivers in Wisconsin and across the country, that savings is real and meaningful. Blending American-grown ethanol into our fuel is one of the most effective strategies we have to shield

consumers from global energy market disruptions. Renewable fuels strengthen U.S. energy

security at critical moments. Wisconsin’s biofuels industry plays a direct role in delivering

that protection. The state’s farmers grow the corn. Our producers convert it into clean-burning fuel. Our

communities benefit through lower fuel costs, job creation, capital investment, and increased

local tax revenue.

Wisconsin is home to nine ethanol plants. The plants grind 32% of the 545 million bushels of corn

produced in our state each year. This generates approximately 670 million gallons of ethanol

annually. These facilities are a cornerstone of our state’s agricultural economy, supporting both

rural vitality and national energy goals.

Furthermore, the benefits don’t stop at the 10% ethanol blend (E10) that’s now standard nationwide.

Hoekstra’s research also indicates that higher ethanol blends, such as E15 (Unleaded 88), can yield even greater savings per gallon for consumers. These fuels are already expanding across

Wisconsin and the country. By supporting policies that enable year-round sales of higher

ethanol blends and investing in retail infrastructure, we can unlock even more value for

American families.

Ethanol is a national asset economically, environmentally, and strategically. As we honor our

country’s independence this week, let’s also recognize the role renewable fuels play in

preserving it. Ethanol saves every American family money at the pump and helps build a more

resilient, self-reliant energy future.",https://www.q106.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gas-pump-e1669988266460-300x182-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 09:05:46.376778

More wind and solar on the electric grid helps keep utility bills lower, and Biden-era tax credits would have ramped up those projects.

Climate United Fund and other nonprofits in March sued the Environmental Protection Agency, its administrator Lee Zeldin and Citibank, which held the program's money. The lawsuit argued the defendants had illegally denied the groups access to billions awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a ""green bank."" The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn't already been obligated to its recipients.

The EPA said the bill should hand it a victory in its court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington. Now that Congress has rescinded funding, an earlier federal judge's decision forcing the EPA to release money to the groups should be reversed, the agency said in its Thursday court filing.

Climate United Fund disagrees. It acknowledges that the bill in Congress is a ""significant policy setback"" but argues that most of the money had been disbursed and is unaffected by the bill. And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there's a different process the agency would need to follow.

""Our funds have already been obligated and disbursed. Any effort to claim otherwise is simply a lie to justify illegal attempts to claw back funds intended to benefit communities across the country,"" CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated repealing the program would save just $19 million, which is in line with its administrative expenses only, indicating the bill doesn't touch the multibillion-dollar grant awards, according to Lauren Tsuboyama, spokesperson for the Power Forward Communities coalition, which received a green bank award.

According to the EPA, when the agency terminated the grants the funds ""became unobligated.""

""Grantees have desperately performed legal gymnastics to hold tens of billions of taxpayer dollars hostage. In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,"" EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.

The green bank's goals run counter to the Trump administration's opposition to policies that address climate change and its embrace of fossil fuels. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the $20 billion in grants as a scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.

In February, Zeldin told Fox News that he suspected the green bank ""was a clear cut case of waste and abuse"" that ""in my opinion, is criminal."" The following month, Zeldin terminated the grants.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has previously said that when the federal government was asked for evidence of fraud, the agency didn't provide it and shifted its position. Chutkan, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, decided the government can't terminate the contracts and that the groups should have access to some of their frozen money.

That order was put on hold during the EPA's appeal.

The agency argues the nonprofits are making constitutional and statutory arguments that don't apply in what it sees as a simple contract fight.

If the government successfully argues the case is a contract dispute, then the EPA says it should be heard by a different court that can only award a lump sum -- not force the government to keep the grants in place. Federal officials argue there is no law or provision in the Constitution that compels the EPA to make these grants to these groups.

In its court filing, the EPA also pointed to comments by Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as supportive of the agency's position.

Musk's bid to dismantle the ""Porky Pig Party"" and prioritize fiscal discipline while defending his tech and energy interests creates a volatile policy landscape. For investors, this is not merely a political spectacle but a critical lens through which to reassess exposures in tech monopolies, renewable energy, and infrastructure. Let's dissect the risks and opportunities.

The Fiscal Crossroads: EV Subsidies vs. Debt Reduction

At the heart of Musk's agenda is a paradox: preserving subsidies for his core industries (EVs, space tech) while slashing the national debt. The $7,500 EV tax credit—a lifeline for Tesla—faces existential threats from fiscal conservatives. Musk's proposed ""sensible wind-down"" of subsidies clashes with deficit hawks aiming to eliminate them entirely by 2025.

Tesla (TSLA) has historically faltered during subsidy debates. In 2023, rumors of tax credit cuts triggered a 25% drop in its stock. Today, the stakes are higher: losing the credit could cost Tesla $1.2 billion annually, ceding ground to Chinese rivals like BYD. Investors must ask: Can Musk's political clout shield Tesla, or will fiscal austerity prevail?

Energy Sector: Fossil Fuel Fights vs. EV Infrastructure Resilience

While Musk's party pushes EV subsidies, the executive order ""Unleashing American Energy"" (Jan 2025) prioritizes fossil fuels, mandating expanded oil/gas production and scrapping EV mandates. This creates a split:

- Traditional Energy: Firms like Peabody Energy (BTU) may see subsidy cuts, but natural gas utilities (e.g., Dominion Energy (D)) could thrive as a ""bridge fuel.""

- EV Infrastructure: ChargePoint (CHPT) and Tesla's Supercharger network are shielded by $4B in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funds, making them safer bets than Tesla itself.

Historically, CHPT outperforms TSLA during subsidy volatility (+14.57% vs. -25.46% over 60 days). This suggests a tactical shift: short TSLA while long CHPT to hedge against policy whiplash.

Infrastructure & Space Tech: Bipartisan Goldmines

Musk's focus on fiscal austerity may backfire in one arena: infrastructure. The BIL's $4B for EV charging and bipartisan support for space colonization (e.g., NASA's $12B SpaceX contracts) create rare consensus.

Aerospace: Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Maxar Technologies (MAXR) stand to benefit from space tech and defense projects, insulated from partisan squabbles.

Renewables: NextEra Energy (NEE) gains from bipartisan infrastructure spending, even as Musk's party negotiates EV subsidy terms.

Political Realities: Can the America Party Deliver?

The party's survival hinges on overcoming state ballot access hurdles (e.g., California's 75,000-member threshold) and FEC contribution limits ($10k/year per state chapter). Legal challenges from existing parties could delay its influence until 2026. For now, the ""swing bloc"" strategy—targeting 2-3 Senate seats—may yield limited legislative sway.

Investment Playbook for Volatility

Short Tesla (TSLA) while long ChargePoint (CHPT) to exploit subsidy policy swings.

Rotate capital from fossil fuels to clean energy plays like NEE, benefiting from infrastructure spending.

Overweight aerospace stocks (LMT, MAXR) for space tech's bipartisan appeal.

Hedge with gold (GLD) and inflation-protected bonds (TIP) to weather political uncertainty.

Conclusion: A High-Risk, High-Return Policy Landscape

Musk's America Party has injected unpredictability into sectors tied to his interests. EVs face subsidy risks, while infrastructure and space tech offer relative safety. Investors must balance exposure to Musk's core industries with defensive positions—until the political smoke clears. As the old adage goes: Beware the man who wants to save the world… he might just disrupt it first.

Turns out, the EV6 was built in Georgia and packed with more American-made parts than most Chevys.
In 2025, the Tesla Model 3, Model Y, Model X, and Model S claimed the top four spots.
The Kia EV6 ranked sixth, and the Volkswagen ID.4 came in tenth.
It also underscores contradictions, as some traditionally “foreign” brands may build more American-made cars than legacy U.S. brands.","With factory jobs disappearing and tariffs driving up prices, Americans are desperate to support vehicles built at home. I thought buying a Kia meant shipping jobs overseas, but in a twist that’s setting Reddit and Facebook comment sections on fire, the 2025 Kia EV6 ranked sixth on the American-Made Index. Turns out, the EV6 was built in Georgia and packed with more American-made parts than most Chevys. Meanwhile, some “American” cars are assembled overseas with imported parts.

For the first time, six of the top ten vehicles in the 2025 American-Made Index (AMI) are electric, signaling a major shift in domestic EV production. The AMI, compiled annually by Cars.com, ranks vehicles by how much of their content and labor is sourced from the United States. In 2025, the Tesla Model 3, Model Y, Model X, and Model S claimed the top four spots. The Kia EV6 ranked sixth, and the Volkswagen ID.4 came in tenth. Other EVs on the broader list include the Ford F-150 Lightning (22nd place), Hyundai Ioniq 5 (30th place), and the Kia EV9 (67th place). The surge in electric models reflects deeper integration of EV manufacturing into the U.S. auto economy. This year, 11 battery-electric models qualified, up from just eight last year, with another 19 hybrids and plug-in hybrids also making the list. The top 10 models show that EVs are not only here to stay but are being made closer to home.

This has led to a lot of social media buzz about which EVs made the list and the implications for “buying American.” Here’s a recent post on Reddit by black88mx6 about why the 2025 EV6 made the top ten.

“The battery on the EV6 is manufactured here in the USA and is one of the reasons for the delay for the new 2025 model. This is reflected in the 80% USA/Canada content 2025 EV6 percentage vs 20% USA/Canada for the 2025 Ioniq 5's up to VIN 10,000.”

detox4you responded with:

“Building batteries in the USA will become difficult if China keeps blocking exporting materials needed.”

black88mx6 added:

“Materials will be sourced from elsewhere, just not for the same cost.”

The American-Made Index (AMI) is important because it provides transparency into how much of a vehicle’s content and labor is sourced from the United States. This helps consumers make informed choices that align with their economic, patriotic, or sustainability values. The AMI has taken on more importance as supply chain concerns, tariffs, and geopolitical tensions affect global trade. Consumers are increasingly interested in buying vehicles that support American jobs and reduce reliance on foreign production. The AMI helps spotlight automakers that have invested in U.S. manufacturing, like Tesla, Kia, and Volkswagen. It also underscores contradictions, as some traditionally “foreign” brands may build more American-made cars than legacy U.S. brands.

The American-Made Index ranks vehicles using five key factors: location of final assembly, percentage of U.S. and Canadian parts, origin of available engines and transmissions, and U.S. manufacturing workforce. With growing awareness of economic nationalism and supply chain reliability, these criteria matter more than ever to both consumers and analysts. This year’s rankings reflect a shift toward valuing domestic content and job creation. For example, the Kia EV6 surprised many by ranking sixth due to its assembly at the West Point, Georgia plant and its impressive 80 percent U.S. and Canadian parts content, the highest of any vehicle sold in the country. Cars.com emphasized that transparency around where cars are made is increasingly important as buyers weigh their purchasing decisions. In a year marked by global instability and trade tensions, the index has become more than just a technical measure, it’s now a key signal of economic and industrial alignment.

Tariffs and Policy Changes Drive Consumer Behavior, plus Affordability and Incentive Concerns

The new 25 percent tariffs on foreign-built vehicles and imported auto parts have amplified consumer interest in domestically produced cars. These import taxes, introduced under the Trump administration, are expected to raise car prices by several thousand dollars and create pressure on affordability, especially for lower-priced models. According to Cars.com, vehicles priced below $30,000 are mostly imported, and only two such vehicles are made in the U.S. Political dynamics are also shifting. While the Biden administration backed EV adoption with tax credits and infrastructure investment, a Republican-led rollback is gaining momentum. The House has already passed a bill to end the $7,500 EV tax credit, and the Senate is now considering it. Former President Trump has vocally criticized EV incentives and distanced himself from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. These developments create an unpredictable policy environment for both automakers and consumers and could slow the momentum of U.S.-based EV production and adoption.

Rising vehicle prices and the potential loss of federal tax incentives are fueling concerns about EV affordability. The $7,500 federal tax credit, which helped offset EV costs for many buyers, is now under threat in Congress. Without it, the barrier to EV ownership could grow, especially for first-time or budget-conscious buyers. Analysts note that most EVs priced under $30,000 are imported and may become even more expensive with new tariffs. Cars.com data shows that among 18 sub-$30K vehicles, only two are made in the United States. While a majority of surveyed shoppers say they are willing to pay more for American-made cars if it means supporting U.S. jobs, that sentiment may not translate into action for buyers seeking affordability. Automakers now face the dual challenge of keeping costs down while building vehicles domestically. Without incentives, the industry could struggle to meet its electrification goals, especially among mainstream consumers.

Tesla continues to dominate the American-Made Index, a position it has held for several years. For 2025, Tesla vehicles take the top four spots, led by the Model 3 at number one, followed by the Model Y, Model X, and Model S. These results reflect the company's vertical integration and localized production strategy. All of Tesla’s light-duty passenger vehicles are assembled in California or Texas, boosting their rankings based on U.S.-based labor and parts content. Tesla’s consistent lead in the AMI highlights the company’s investment in domestic supply chains and workforce. Its manufacturing model gives it an edge over conventional automakers who rely more heavily on foreign assembly and parts. This strong U.S. presence also insulates Tesla from some of the volatility tied to global logistics and trade policy. As the EV landscape evolves, Tesla’s early commitment to building vehicles in America has allowed it to remain at the forefront of AMI rankings.

All of this results in lower monthly energy costs.","People are always looking for ways to save money, particularly on their monthly bills.

When it comes to energy costs, EnergySage spoke to several experts, and one thing became clear.

""News flash: We already have the answer,"" EnergySage said.

That relies largely on more widespread adoption of solar energy, those experts told EnergySage. As rooftop solar panels are more common, other options become available, such as expanded use of battery storage and virtual power plants.

As a leading, independent source for all things solar, EnergySage knows a thing or two about how to make that happen. Along with its objective information and advice, EnergySage also offers free tools that allow homeowners to quickly compare quotes from solar panel installers.

First, solar provides clean energy, free of the harmful carbon pollution caused by dirty sources like coal and gas. Roughly three-quarters of the United States' human-caused greenhouse gas pollution comes from burning fossil fuels for energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Renewable sources, like solar, can also be paired with battery storage to provide more stability. When the sun is shining, solar panels often create more energy than is needed for that moment. Battery units allow for that energy to be stored and used whenever it's needed.

Batteries are also key to virtual power plants, where utilities pay customers to use some of their excess stored energy. This allows customers to save even more on their energy costs while also giving utilities the ability to provide clean, low-cost energy to all their customers when the grid is stressed or down.

Using residential solar also keeps power local, which solves another problem. Studies have shown that about 6% of power is lost as electricity travels from power plants to homes. The closer our energy sources are, the more efficient our energy use is.

All of this results in lower monthly energy costs. By using EnergySage's tools, users can also see considerable savings on installation costs.

The company estimates that using its quote-comparison tool, people can save up to $10,000 on installation costs. By using EnergySage's mapping tool, users can see the average cost of a home solar panel system, along with any available incentives, for their state.

But anyone who wants to realize those savings may want to act quickly. Among the cuts being considered in Congress' budget negotiations is the Investment Tax Credit, which allows homeowners to deduct 30% of solar installation costs from their federal taxes — a savings of about $7,200 on a $24,000 installation.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/solar-energyimage-recCuDigKDIj8ftb6-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 04:02:46.648364

But the trucking industry has described an alarming situation for California sellers as a result.
""At the end of the day, California became a used truck market instead of a new truck market,"" she said.
INSIDE THE LOBBYING PUSH President Trump, at the ceremony to sign the legislation canceling the California rules, acknowledged controversy surrounding the move.
He noted that the trucking industry represents 4% of vehicles on the road in the United States but moves approximately 73% of all freight.","WASHINGTON -- As the Republican campaign to halt ambitious electric vehicle policies mostly spotlighted the cars and light trucks in personal garages and driveways across the country, a less-discussed part of the auto industry celebrated a center-stage moment last month.

""The trucking industry has America's back, and we are grateful that a president and the administration ... have our back too,"" veteran driver Gina Jones said at a June 12 White House event. President Donald Trump invited her to speak at a bill signing ceremony to cancel California's influential, strictest-in-the-nation emissions standards.

Jones, who has professionally driven over a million miles, spoke proudly on behalf of an industry that strongly lobbied against the environmental standards. California and states that voluntarily adopted identical rules had sought to quickly curb the trucking business's sizable contribution to planet-warming emissions.

To do so, the Golden State rules would have forced a transition to EVs across all segments of the auto industry more quickly than critics say the market is ready for. But the effect on medium and heavy-duty vehicles -- woven into the fabric of American life through delivery vans, firetrucks, cement mixers, tractor trailers and more -- might have been especially pronounced.

Chris Spear, president and CEO of the American Trucking Associations, said he felt ""just tremendous relief"" when Congress and Trump canceled the rules, which he called ""not even within the realm of possibility.""

Environmentalists have taken a different stance, suggesting that California regulators worked with businesses in crafting the rules and were always prepared to be flexible in the face of market realities.

""Congressional Republicans and the (Trump) administration taking a sledgehammer to these regulations ... really doesn't reflect the engagement and stakeholder process that was happening,"" said Guillermo Ortiz, a clean vehicles advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

He added: ""We were hitting the gas and accelerating innovation here in the United States, but then they slammed the brakes so hard, it's giving everyone whiplash.""

RULES AND CLASSES

Spear's relief came after lawmakers controversially nixed two key federal waivers that allowed California to restrict emissions for medium and heavy-duty vehicles significantly more than federal standards.

One waiver granted in March 2023 allowed California's Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, which required zero-emission trucks to make up between 40% and 75% of all new model sales by 2035, depending on vehicle class. The rules defined ZEVs as fully battery-electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which remain a barely available technology.

The other waiver, granted in December 2024, allowed the state's Heavy-Duty Low NOx Omnibus regulation to take effect. That rule would have required significant reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides, a precursor to smog.

While sales of light-duty EVs have hovered around 10% of the national new vehicle market for the past two years, the transition to electric powertrains among heavier trucks and work vehicles has been slower. In some weight classes, according to data from the American Truck Dealers trade group, market share is yet to surpass 0.1%.

""We have to be in a position to actually achieve the targets and timelines that are put in these requirements, and the only way that happens is if they reflect reality,"" said Spear, a former executive for Hyundai Motor Co. ""And we didn't feel that a lot of the targets and timelines that California put forth did that.""

Ortiz, who strongly supported the rules, acknowledged that there would be different challenges for electrification across the highly varied medium and heavy-duty vehicle spectrum. E-commerce and delivery companies have already made significant deployments and purchase orders for vans, while long-haul trucking and other kinds of work vehicles have seen slower adoption.

American companies and public entities have committed to deploying close to 260,000 Class 2B and 3 electric cargo delivery vans into the next decade, according to a tracker compiled by the Environmental Defense Fund. The commitments for Class 7 and 8 tractor trucks total about 9,900.

The cargo category includes major commitments from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. and fleet management business Merchants Fleet. Amazon has committed to deploying 100,000 vans from EV startup Rivian Automotive Inc. by 2030, while Merchants Fleet has committed to about 30,000 total electric vans from General Motors Co.'s BrightDrop line and Stellantis NV's Ram brand.

The largest Class 8 truck commitment also came from Amazon, which committed to buying 1,250 electric Lion8 trucks from Volvo Cars with a target deployment later this year.

Ortiz said the rules were designed to account for different paces of electrification for each weight class. He also said that California, in response to current market conditions, was in the process of adjusting rules to allow credit trading across segments and participating states.

""No one wants a rule that fundamentally doesn't work or is destined to fail,"" he said. Those added flexibilities would have required federal signoff, however, which was always unlikely under a Trump administration that wanted to ditch the rules entirely.

Still, Ortiz noted, all vehicle classes have met their required targets so far in California. Notably, about 19.7% of new Class 2 vehicle registrations in the state last year were electric, well above mandated levels.

But the trucking industry has described an alarming situation for California sellers as a result. Sales in some segments fell by about 50% in 2024, according to the American Truck Dealers trade group.

Jacqueline Gelb, president of the group, said there was a ""significant market disruption"" in the state because of compliance pressures. She explained that there was limited ZEV truck demand from customers. In turn, that limited how many diesel-powered vehicles dealers could sell due to the sales percentage rules.

""At the end of the day, California became a used truck market instead of a new truck market,"" she said.

INSIDE THE LOBBYING PUSH

President Trump, at the ceremony to sign the legislation canceling the California rules, acknowledged controversy surrounding the move.

""People said it couldn't be done. You got it done,"" he said. ""But boy, it's been -- it's had us tied up in knots for years.""

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, congressional Republicans and conservative lawyers broke with precedent and typical parliamentary procedure to use the Congressional Review Act to revoke the Biden-era waivers.

Throughout the process, they were cheered on by lobbyists like the Trucking Associations' Spear, who pleaded to lawmakers about ""common sense"" and the potential harms to a key national sector. He noted that the trucking industry represents 4% of vehicles on the road in the United States but moves approximately 73% of all freight.

""Because of our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint, and because of 40 years of work, we've reduced emissions coming out of (heavy-duty truck) tailpipes by 98.5% since 1988,"" Spear said. ""That's some really powerful and compelling numbers.""

He also pointed out that five states previously aligned with California's trucking regulations cancelled or eased enforcement for the next several years as businesses face significant cost and implementation hurdles.

“These new projects reflect UNEP’s deep commitment to supporting countries on the frontlines of climate change,” said Martin Krause, Director of UNEP’s Climate Change Division.

About the Green Climate Fund The Green Climate Fund – a critical element of the historic Paris Agreement - is the world’s largest climate fund, mandated to support developing countries raise and realise their Nationally Determined Contributions ambitions towards low-emissions, climate-resilient pathways.","The Green Climate Fund (GCF) has approved over US$120 million in new funding to strengthen climate resilience in Ghana, the Maldives, and Mauritania.

At the request of the three countries, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) developed these projects to help vulnerable communities anticipate and adapt to increasingly severe impacts of climate change through nature-based solutions, climate-resilient agriculture, early warning systems and improved water security.

Henry Gonzalez, Chief Investment Officer of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), said: “The approval of these projects demonstrates how GCF is supporting country ownership of national climate action priorities in Ghana, Maldives, and Mauritania. These investments will positively impact key areas of climate resilience in all three countries.”

The initiatives are a major step forward in deploying adaptation finance where it is most needed — particularly in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and the Sahel region. They are expected to benefit more than 3.5 million people.

“These new projects reflect UNEP’s deep commitment to supporting countries on the frontlines of climate change,” said Martin Krause, Director of UNEP’s Climate Change Division. “Our focus is on contextualizing climate solutions to the benefit of the most vulnerable nations and communities with tailored, locally led, and science-based solutions.”

Ghana

Northern Ghana faces increasingly erratic rainfall and long dry seasons that have led to chronic food shortages, drying water bodies, and the destruction of infrastructure from flooding. Smallholder farmers, reliant on rainfed subsistence agriculture, are especially vulnerable. High temperatures reduce the land’s water-retention capacity, and extreme rain events risk dam collapse and downstream flooding.

In response, the new US$70 million project – including a US$63 million GCF grant – aims to build the resilience of agroecosystems and rural livelihoods. The initiative will support 120 communities across eight districts in the North East, Upper East, and Upper West regions.

Activities include improving access to climate data and early warnings, enabling dry season farming through water storage solutions, and restoring 28,000 hectares of degraded land to improve soil health, improve water retention and reduce flood risks.

Implemented by the Government of Ghana through the Environmental Protection Agency and Ghana Meteorological Agency, the project will benefit 619,000 people directly, while early warning alerts will reach up to 2.9 million people. Around 120,000 individuals will experience improved food security as a result of climate-resilient farming practices.

Maldives

Maldives is the world’s most exposed country to climate change. Comprising 1,192 islands, nearly 80 per cent of which lie less than one meter above sea level, Maldives faces the constant threat from rising sea levels.

In addition to rising seas, the country is vulnerable to more frequent and severe storm surges, floods, heatwaves, coastal erosion, and other hazards exacerbated by climate change. These hazards are already disrupting critical economic sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and tourism, affecting the entire population of Maldives. The poorest, most marginalised and remote communities, and women and children are particularly susceptible.

To strengthen the country’s ability to adapt to these threats and reduce vulnerability to climate change, UNEP, in coordination with several national and international partners, developed the project, Toward Risk-Aware and Climate-Resilient Communities (TRACT) – Strengthening Climate Services and Impact-Based Multi-Hazard Early Warning in the Maldives.

The US$25 million project – expected to benefit more than half a million people – will be implemented over five years under the lead of UNEP. It aligns with the goal of the Early Warnings for All initiative (EW4All) to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous climate events through early warning systems by 2027 and it will deliver on the Maldives’ roadmap to achieve the EW4All Initiative, developed by the Government of Maldives and international partners to guide the scaling up of early warning systems in the country.

Mauritania

In the fragile zone between the Sahara and Sahel, prolonged droughts, sand encroachment, and water scarcity are threatening lives and livelihoods. Mauritania has seen accelerating dune movement, siltation of water sources, and growing pressure on socio-economic infrastructure such as roads and schools. Agricultural output remains extremely low, with the country importing up to 85 per cent of its food.

With a US$33 million investment — including a US$30 million GCF grant — the new UNEP project will restore ecosystems and secure livelihoods in four vulnerable hubs: Aoujeft, Rachid, Tamcheket, and Nema. It will support green-grey infrastructure to fix dunes and control sand encroachment, improve access to water for farming and land rehabilitation, and scale up climate-resilient agriculture to boost food security and incomes.

Led by Mauritania’s Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, the project will directly benefit 85,000 people and improve resilience for 145,000 more. It will also protect 2,100 hectares of land and support the country’s contributions to the Great Green Wall — a multilateral African initiative to combat desertification and build climate resilience across the continent.

This credit was implemented through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and administered by the Internal Revenue Service.
Gin also noted that the end of the tax credit would disproportionately affect certain income groups.

It was part of the president's tax and spending bill he signed into law Friday.

The tax incentive has allowed taxpayers to qualify for up to $7,500 in tax credits for new EVs and up to $4,000 for pre-owned vehicles, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. This credit was implemented through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and administered by the Internal Revenue Service.

""It's really kind of sad that it's ending because it's going to mean the ending to a lot of green energy jobs, a lot of electric vehicle jobs around the country,"" said Elaine Borseth, President of the San Diego chapter of the Electric Vehicle Association.

The expiration of these credits could have significant implications for EV sales and adoption rates. Alan Gin, an economics professor at the University of San Diego's Knauss School of Business, explained the potential impact: ""They are normally more expensive than gas powered cars so that helps buyers so if you take them away I think that will cause sales to slow.""

Gin also noted that the end of the tax credit would disproportionately affect certain income groups. ""The low to medium income ranges are going to be impacted most by this because they have less income and these incentives then allowed them to purchase these electric vehicles,"" he said.

For those considering purchasing an EV, Borseth advises acting quickly.

And there is something happening in almost every community that is part of a clean energy transition.","On May 8th, 2025, the Network for Responsible Public Policy (NFRPP) convened a session to discuss the future of the transition to clean energy in the face of some stiff headwinds caused by the new US administration led by Donald Trump. The panel included Dale Bryk, Director of State and Regional Policy at the Harvard Environmental and Energy Law Program and a Senior Fellow at the Regional Plan Association, and Dan Sosland, President of the Acadia Center. The discussion was moderated by Richard Eidlin, National Policy Director for Business for America.

The actions of the Trump administration are somewhat surprising, given the campaign rhetoric at face value. While the administration promised an end to burdensome Federal regulation and an era of new Federalism, the current policy regarding clean energy and the environment has been anything but. The president’s executive order “Unleashing American Energy”, issued on January 20th, 2025, is, in fact, a heavy-handed intrusion by the Federal government into state and local energy policies, and reads, according to Bryk, like a “mindless assault on anything that sounds clean.”

While the acts of the current administration will make a transition to clean energy more difficult, the message from Bryk was that “the arc of history bends towards clean energy.” The transition will happen because, politics aside, the science is now clear and not in dispute. So what can be done in the face of an administration that is antagonistic to this transition? As described by the panel, US states in fact have a tremendous amount of jurisdiction over not only energy policies, but over the industries that primarily contribute to climate change, such as transportation and housing. And the advice from Bryk to those state and local governments is “not to chase the chaos.” Most states and communities have affirmative agendas for their energy policies, and those need to be defended, including in the courts.

There is a long history of Federal and state collaboration on various programs, and many states also cooperate among themselves to agree on, for example, emission limits from power plants operating within those states. Historically, these efforts have broad bipartisan support. One of the points repeatedly mentioned during this presentation was that there is more agreement on the need for an energy transition than might be apparent based on the highly polarized talking points visible at the national level. But how is this possible?

Part of the reason is that the discussion at the state and local levels is not necessarily about “climate change.” In fact, how we discuss the transition to clean energy is a complicated issue itself, and what we say can also obscure what is happening in many states. Bryk emphasized that in many states, “climate is not the driver. Job creation is the driver.” Or, reducing energy costs is the driver, or just trying to keep energy dollars local is the driver. It can be surprising for people steeped in climate change discussions to learn that the US states that generate the most wind power (Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas) or have the most widespread use of heat pumps (South Carolina) do not have the most aggressive climate policies. They have other priorities that align with the desire to make a transition to clean energy, and the climate impact may be just a side benefit, for now. On the topic of the transition to clean energy, the American electorate has more in common than it has differences. Even conservatives argue that the Trump energy policy is interfering in the market, and is not allowing renewable energy sources to move to the forefront. However, it is often economically advantageous for them to do so.

So, how we talk about this issue matters. As Sosland emphasized, we are all paying for the costs of the energy choices we are currently making. We pay not just in terms of dollars, but also in terms of the impact on the climate and our own health. “We need to do a better job in the climate community of framing a message that works. We talk so much about cost, so much about utility and other kinds of economics…we are really talking about human beings in flood zones, coughing, getting sick. We are talking about humans here. The human impact of this issue is not even being addressed. That has to change. It has to turn around.” As Bryk put it, “The underlying values that we have are not controversial, and that’s a place where we can start and have conversations about these things with our families and our friends.”

If the transition is going to happen, however, it’s not the case that unleashed market forces by themselves will get us to where we want to be. As Bryk recognized, we know that there are “communities across the country that have been overburdened by pollution and underserved by the clean energy solutions.” There is a disconnect, and it’s important to think about what, as she says, a “just and orderly transition looks like, economic sector by economic sector. To make that transition orderly, we will need policies to be put into place that avoid the failures that often occur in the market. “That’s part of what we have to think about when we are thinking about equitable transition … all of those opportunities to intervene and help it work better and prevent the bad things from happening that can happen in a transition.”

The approach of the current administration will pose the greatest challenges to our ability to create just policies. Although states and communities have power, states cannot do everything when plans involve, for example, Federal leases, and the government may renege on those contracts. This makes it extremely difficult to conduct business. “What can you rely on if you can’t rely on the signature of the US government on a signed contract?” Bryk asked. The opposition of the Federal government to enabling a clean energy transition is especially surprising, given that data shows economic forces are already pushing in that direction. Sosland reminded us that in the Northeast region of the country, energy production was 21% based on coal just 10-15 years ago. It is now less than 1% coal. Market pressures are driving the shift away from fossil fuels. This is why the panel believes that the transition is inevitable, but the opposition of the Federal government will delay the transition timeframe, and that may or may not be the time that we have. International agreements aim to achieve goals by 2030, 2035, and 2050. If we are not on track to meet the first targets, we will either not meet or it will be much more expensive to meet the 2050 target. So, while the technology and ingenuity is in place, the policies of the current administration are incredibly damaging. “This isn’t a blip, necessarily, that is affordable. Losing four or more years is really going to be damaging to meeting the 2030, 2035 targets as we head to 2050,” Sosland reminded us. “There is an enormous amount to worry about,” Bryk said. We are currently in a very precarious position. I have confidence in the states, cities, communities, and some businesses. But, we are not meeting many targets that many states and companies have set. And now we are being hamstrung in a way … that’s out of our power. But there are always other places where we can make a lot of progress,” said Bryk.

And this last comment highlighted the areas of optimism that the panel wanted to emphasize. While the stance of the current US administration can be disheartening, the panel believes that considerable good can be achieved at the state and local levels.

For example, small communities are doing quite a bit. Putting solar farms on landfills. Creating bike paths as alternatives to cars. Massachusetts has incentives to adopt very stringent energy codes, so new buildings are being constructed to very high standards. Many states with climate policies are demonstrably improving the quality of life in their communities. Almost all states (44) participate in the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program, a policy initiated under the IRA. Whether or not these states have explicit climate policies doesn’t matter as much as the fact that they see good reasons to pursue a migration to a clean energy infrastructure. They have recognized that we are always spending money on energy infrastructure, so we can choose to allocate it to options that will yield greater benefits and longer lifespans.

If there is so much agreement on the underlying principles, why does it still seem so difficult to talk about it? The answer to that seems to be that, at the current level of polarization in our society, it is challenging to discuss anything that has become a political litmus test. How to talk about this issue was branded by Bryk as the “question of our time.” The advice given by this panel was to adopt the old aphorism, “think globally, and act locally.” It is hard to have these conversations at the national level, but easier at the state level, and even easier at the community level. And there is something happening in almost every community that is part of a clean energy transition. So, getting involved at the local level, for example, with local faith organizations, was described as one of the best ways to engage in this issue while avoiding much of the damaging political rhetoric.

But, we are not meeting many targets that many states and companies have set. And now we are being hamstrung in a way … that’s out of our power. But there are always other places where we can make a lot of progress,” said Bryk.

And this last comment highlighted the areas of optimism that the panel wanted to emphasize. While the stance of the current US administration can be disheartening, the panel believes that considerable good can be achieved at the state and local levels.

For example, small communities are doing quite a bit. Putting solar farms on landfills. Creating bike paths as alternatives to cars. Massachusetts has incentives to adopt very stringent energy codes, so new buildings are being constructed to very high standards. Many states with climate policies are demonstrably improving the quality of life in their communities. Almost all states (44) participate in the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program, a policy initiated under the IRA. Whether or not these states have explicit climate policies doesn’t matter as much as the fact that they see good reasons to pursue a migration to a clean energy infrastructure. They have recognized that we are always spending money on energy infrastructure, so we can choose to allocate it to options that will yield greater benefits and longer lifespans.

If there is so much agreement on the underlying principles, why does it still seem so difficult to talk about it? The answer to that seems to be that, at the current level of polarization in our society, it is challenging to discuss anything that has become a political litmus test. How to talk about this issue was branded by Bryk as the “question of our time.” The advice given by this panel was to adopt the old aphorism, “think globally, and act locally.” It is hard to have these conversations at the national level, but easier at the state level, and even easier at the community level. And there is something happening in almost every community that is part of a clean energy transition. So, getting involved at the local level, for example, with local faith organizations, was described as one of the best ways to engage in this issue while avoiding much of the damaging political rhetoric.

Under Donald J. Trump’s America First energy policy, not so much.

The David vs. Goliath narrative has collapsed on the altar of proof. What had been sold to the public and policymakers as a righteous battle on behalf of the voiceless has been exposed as a series of coordinated political stunts driven by activist law firms, dark-money donors and operatives looking to have left-leaning judges formulate American energy policy from the bench.

On June 25, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing led by Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz investigated the various outside entities perpetuating these lawsuits, including the San Francisco-based plaintiffs’ firm Sher Edling LLP and the Environmental Law Institute.

Critics say these groups aren’t interested in pursuing justice or protecting the environment. Instead, they’re shaking down the energy industry using the threat of billion-dollar damages to bring about extreme policy changes that voters and lawmakers have both rejected.

These lawsuits needlessly clog the courts, so a growing number of state and federal judges are starting to slam the doors on them.

In the past few months, judges in Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have dismissed climate lawsuits as being outside the scope of state law. Pennsylvania Judge Stephen Corr put it this way: The “claims raised … are not justiciable by any state court.” Similar decisions have been rendered by judges in Baltimore; Bucks County, Pennsylvania; and Anne Arundel County, Maryland, all of whom recognized the Clean Air Act delegates the authority to set emissions policy to the federal government, not to trial lawyers acting as climate crusaders.

Cases making the counterargument persist because an activist ecosystem gratuitously props them up. Sher Edling, operating on a contingency fee basis and bankrolled by dark-money funds such as the Collective Action Fund, has filed more than two dozen nearly identical lawsuits on behalf of states and municipalities. The objective is a massive payout emerging from a single court that breaks with the precedent being quickly established.

The Environmental Law Institute’s Climate Judiciary Project has “briefed” more than 2,000 judges in closed-door sessions with no public oversight on issues including climate science and litigation strategy. The curriculum for these sessions was developed by academics and lawyers tied to the lawsuits themselves, notably former UCLA Professor Ann Carlson, a Biden appointee who helped fundraise and consult for the law firm.

This isn’t education. It’s lobbying cloaked in robes. And the consequences are severe. We’re told these lawsuits are about accountability. They’re really about politics, power and paychecks. This is lawfare, pure and simple, intended to pressure settlements, vilify American energy and circumvent the legislative process. Even Puerto Rico, once a willing participant, saw the writing on the wall. Just days after the DOJ moved to block similar cases in other states, the Commonwealth withdrew its lawsuit against the energy companies.

It was a smart move, one that other states should follow. Yet some, such as Hawaii and California, continue. In New Jersey, a judge dismissed the state’s case with prejudice, warning that global emissions can’t be regulated piecemeal through state courts. In Maryland, a judge reversed an earlier decision to allow Annapolis and Anne Arundel County’s case to proceed, citing mounting rulings across jurisdictions that found the legal theory doesn’t apply to state laws.

Still, the activist machine rolls on. The Federal Judicial Center, the research arm of the federal court system, is collaborating with the Environmental Law Institute to provide judges with curated content that aligns with Sher Edling’s litigation narratives. A joint congressional investigation revealed that UCLA’s environmental law clinic has even admitted to providing legal assistance to Sher Edling on these suits — students doing the groundwork while activist lawyers cash in.

This is not the fair, impartial justice system Americans expect. It’s a coordinated campaign — funded in secret, litigated in bulk and designed to wear down the courts until someone, somewhere cracks. So far, the legal system is holding. It’s time for state leaders still involved in this mess to wake up.

Climate litigation may sound noble in a press release. In practice, it’s a bait-and-switch that wastes taxpayer money, undermines judicial integrity and accomplishes nothing. Governors and attorneys general need to stop enabling this legal charade. Drop the lawsuits. Reject the backroom influence of law firms, advocacy groups and their money enablers. Focus on generating reliable energy solutions that work for the future.

The climate litigation house of cards is falling. Who wants to be left holding the last worthless case?

Malaysia is already one of the world’s top producers of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules, hosting industry giants such as First Solar, LONGi, and JA Solar. The country's well-established electronics supply chain, coupled with favorable tax incentives and government support under the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), is accelerating foreign direct investment (FDI) into the renewable energy sector.

Key Drivers for Foreign Participation in Solar:

Competitive labor and infrastructure costs

Duty-free access to major export markets

Strategic location in Southeast Asia

Pro-renewable energy policies and tax incentives

Participation in ESG-aligned industrial ecosystems

The Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI) has identified solar manufacturing as a strategic growth sector, with foreign investors playing a crucial role in scaling up capacity.

The Rise of Sustainable Industrial Parks

To support green industry growth, developers are now prioritizing sustainable features in new industrial park developments. These parks incorporate:

Solar-ready rooftops for tenant factories

Rainwater harvesting systems

Green building certifications (e.g., GBI, LEED)

Smart energy grids for efficient power distribution

EV charging infrastructure and last-mile logistics

Foreign firms, especially those with strong ESG mandates, are seeking industrial spaces that align with their corporate sustainability goals. As a result, sustainable industrial parks are becoming magnets for multinational tenants in sectors like clean energy, EV battery production, and high-tech electronics.

Case Studies: Foreign-Led Green Development

Kulim Hi-Tech Park (Kedah): Home to foreign solar manufacturers such as First Solar, investing over RM4 billion in new capacity.

Batu Kawan Industrial Park (Penang): Integrates green features and attracts ESG-conscious global manufacturers.

i-Park@Senai Airport City (Johor): Features a green-certified design that appeals to foreign investors from Europe and Japan.

These developments underscore how green infrastructure is now a business imperative, not just a branding strategy.

Opportunities for Local and International Stakeholders

Malaysia’s commitment to sustainable development is more than policy—it’s becoming an economic engine. With the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030) emphasizing clean growth, opportunities abound in:

Green logistics and supply chain services

Energy-efficient factory design and retrofitting

Industrial solar power solutions

Water and waste management technologies

Conclusion

Foreign participation in Malaysia’s solar manufacturing and sustainable industrial park development is accelerating rapidly. As global companies align operations with sustainability targets, Malaysia offers a unique value proposition: cost-efficiency, green compliance, and regional connectivity.

The legislation, dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” was passed by House Republicans and signed by the President not long thereafter.

It’s being touted by Trump as a centerpiece of his economic agenda. But Newsom says the bill “rips care from cancer patients, meals from children, and money from working families” to give tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy.

“With this measure, Donald J. Trump’s legacy is now forever cemented: he has created a more unequal, more indebted, and more dangerous America. Shame on him,” Newsom stated.

What the bill does

The sweeping legislation cuts billions in federal spending from programs that provide health care, food assistance, college aid, and public safety resources, while granting significant tax relief to high-income earners and corporations.

According to Governor Newsom’s office, the impact on California could be severe and includes the following:

Health care:

$28.4 billion in Medicaid cuts to California.

Up to 17 million people nationwide projected to lose coverage by 2034.

Cuts that may force rural hospitals across the state to close or limit care options.

Jobs:

An estimated 686,000 California jobs could be lost due to the elimination of clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act.

Labor groups have called the legislation possibly the “biggest job-killing bill in American history.”

Food and family assistance:

Cuts food aid for more than 3 million people nationwide.

Raises taxes for parents who pay for child care.

Public safety:

$646 million cut from FEMA, impacting disaster preparedness.

Cuts to the FBI, DEA, and ATF, reducing law enforcement staffing and capabilities.

Nearly $500 million slashed from cybersecurity efforts, raising concerns over national infrastructure security.

Education and student aid:

Restricts access to Pell Grants and financial aid.

Eliminates loan forgiveness options and deferments for borrowers facing financial hardship.

Environmental and climate programs:

Eliminates wildfire prevention programs, a direct threat to fire-prone regions of California.

Imposes new penalties on hybrid and electric vehicle owners, undermining green energy incentives.

Reproductive rights:

Defunds Planned Parenthood, jeopardizing health care access for more than 1.1 million patients.

Immigration and family separation:

Expands funding for immigration raids, increasing the risk of family separation and workplace crackdowns, particularly in agricultural areas.

Newsom accused President Trump and his supporters of using the bill to advance a political agenda that benefits the wealthy while hurting working Americans. On the other side, the President called the legislative victory “a triumph of democracy.”",https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/07/Newsom-Trump_010925_AP_Rick-Scuteri-and-Rich-Pedroncelli.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-06 02:00:07.077768

Even though Rivian EVs are too expensive to qualify for the EV tax credit, they benefitted from the similar commercial clean vehicle credit.
The deadline for removing the EV credit is set for September 30, leaving people a whole quarter to buy an EV and deduct the $7,500 credit.
Even if customers have not shown much interest in electric vehicles lately, the fear of missing out is a powerful incentive.
The bill could turn out to be the best promotional material for Tesla and other carmakers who sell electric vehicles.","Donald Trump has always hated electric vehicles and everything related to clean transportation, clean energy, and other clean stuff. Not because he knows that they are inherently bad but because he associates them with left activists, the so-called ""woke spirit,"" and, ultimately, the Democrats. Six months after being sworn in, Trump fulfilled his wish to scrap most EV, battery, and clean energy incentives that Biden had included in his Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

There are several ironies at play here, the first being that Trump (and the Republicans who helped pass the bill) removed the money that funded clean projects in mostly red states. Citizens of these states will be among the most affected by scrapping these incentives. By voting for the bill, Republicans jeopardized the livelihoods of their constituents.

The second irony is that Elon Musk paid big dollars to have his subsidies removed. You can say that, without Musk's money and his social media network, Trump wouldn't be in the White House, and the GOP would not have a majority in both the House and the Senate. Without Musk, the Big Beautiful Bill would've remained just a crazy idea inside the twisted mind of a grumpy old man.

Despite knowing exactly what Trump wanted to do, Elon Musk is now very upset about losing the subsidies for his companies. Without the EV tax credit, fewer people would be able to afford a Tesla, especially if Musk won't be able to keep the battery incentives, which amount to $45 per kWh. The bill introduces stricter requirements for battery content and equipment sourcing, the latter being harder to meet. Tesla is building an LFP battery factory with excess equipment sourced from China's CATL, which will not qualify for the battery subsidies under the new rules.

Losing incentives is a big blow to EV adoption

Besides Tesla, other carmakers that invested big in electric vehicles and Li-ion batteries will also be affected. EV sales have dwindled for the past few years, and the federal credits were a huge help in making them accessible to a wider customer base. Tesla and Ford have reported a significant decrease in EV sales in the second quarter, while GM increased its market share.

Rivian is also in trouble, barely making ends meet. Even though Rivian EVs are too expensive to qualify for the EV tax credit, they benefitted from the similar commercial clean vehicle credit. As this will also be canceled on September 30, Rivian will lose an important incentive for its vehicles. Both Rivian and Tesla will lose another important revenue stream: ZEV credits.

While the bill doesn't directly cancel the ZEV credits, it eliminates the reason they have become a commodity. Trump's bill effectively kills the ZEV credit market by removing the penalties for carmakers that fail to meet the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. These credits enabled Rivian to claim a positive gross margin in the past two quarters. Tesla also relied on them, especially in Q1 2025, when its profits plummeted. Tesla would've posted a loss in Q1 2025 if not for the ZEV credits.

Tesla reported another year-over-year sales decline in the second quarter, following a disastrous first quarter. This is why Elon Musk insists that Tesla is no longer a carmaker and car sales are irrelevant. However, until autonomous driving and its Robotaxi service earn more money than the automotive business, Tesla will remain a car company. And it will need its automotive arm to perform strongly in the foreseeable future to stay afloat.

The silver lining: more people will rush to buy an EV this summer

With subsidies removed, this becomes even more problematic. However, the bill has a silver lining: the possibility to deduct up to $10,000 for car loan interest for American-made vehicles. There's another side effect that could benefit Tesla and other EV markers in the short term. The deadline for removing the EV credit is set for September 30, leaving people a whole quarter to buy an EV and deduct the $7,500 credit.

This will likely cause a buying frenzy as people rush to secure an electric car while the credit is still available. Even if customers have not shown much interest in electric vehicles lately, the fear of missing out is a powerful incentive. The bill could turn out to be the best promotional material for Tesla and other carmakers who sell electric vehicles.

Undoubtedly, the massive demand in the third quarter will cause some bottlenecks, which might cause price increases or at least remove sales incentives from the table. It happens every time when a lot of people try to buy a car in a short period. This is a boon for EV makers, although it will be a short-lived consolation.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/instead-of-killing-the-evs-trump-s-bill-will-turn-buying-one-into-a-gold-rush-this-summer-253940_1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 03:00:38.288487

However, the two US-based firms have been in the propulsion business for more than 100 years apiece, and last month they completed a $2.7 billion transaction aimed partly at cementing their respective footprints in global electric vehicle markets.

The Global Electric Vehicle Market Is Calling

EV sales in the US face a somewhat uncertain future domestically, due to an abrupt shift in federal electrification policy this year. Nevertheless, so far, US demand for EVs has held steady, with the notable exception of Tesla.

General Motors, in particular, is very excited about EV sales in the Q2 report it posted earlier this week. In addition, global EV sales continue to rise at a healthy clip, BYD’s electric truck division being one outstanding example. Regardless of domestic policy, US-headquartered firms with a global footprint are following the money.

Both Allison Transmission Holdings of Indiana (founded 1915) and Dana Incorporated of Ohio (founded 1904) are diversified drivetrain and propulsion firms with a firm grip on the internal combustion engine business. Still, as Allison noted in a press release last month, there is money to be made in vehicle electrification.

On June 11, Allison announced that it has acquired Dana’s off-highway business. The $2.7 billion transaction “aligns with Allison’s strategic priorities to expand its emerging markets footprint, enhance core technologies and deliver strong financial results,” Allison explained.

“Upon completion of the transaction, Allison will be able to offer a wider range of commercial-duty powertrain and industrial solutions to more customers and end users worldwide,” the company added.

Combining “emerging markets” with “worldwide,” it sure seems like Allison has bigger fish to fry than the US electric vehicle market. To re-emphasize again, the company does not intend to drop its core business like a hot potato, but the company’s focus on the EV-friendly Asia-Pacific market indicates that the transition to the electric vehicle market is under way.

The Dana transaction is not a one-off. Allison has been investing in its vehicle electrification portfolio over the years, including a new R&D facility in Michigan. The Dana acquisition kicks the activity level up a notch.

“This acquisition marks a transformative milestone in our commitment to empowering our current and future customers with propulsion and drivetrain solutions that Improve the Way the World Works,” emphasized Allison Chair and CEO David Graziosi in a press statement.

“We look forward to harnessing this momentum to increase value for all of our stakeholders worldwide,” he emphasized again.

What’s In It For Dana?

Meanwhile, Dana has been on an electrification journey of its own. The shedding the off-highway line was an unexpected windfall for the company’s future plans. At $2.7 billion, the transaction “represents 7x the expected 2025 adjusted EBITDA of the Off-Highway business,” Dana reported in a press statement, with EBITDA referring to the standard financial measurement Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.

As with Allison, Dana has no intention of dropping the ICE shoe any time soon. However, alongside other cost-cutting measures the Allison transaction will enable Dana to focus more closely on the growing demand for electric vehicles among fleet owners.

“As we committed to last year, the sale of the Off-Highway business supports our strategy to become a streamlined light- and commercial-vehicle supplier with traditional and electrified systems,” explained R. Bruce McDonald, Dana’s Chairman and CEO in a press statement on June 11.

“Dana has taken a leading position in vehicle electrification. In fact, with in-house gearbox, low- to high-voltage motor, inverter, controls, and thermal and battery management expertise, we are the only supplier capable of delivering all elements of a complete, fully integrated electrified system across all mobility markets,” Dana reminds everyone on its website. The company also launched the LEED-certified Sustainable Mobility Center at its World Headquarters campus in Maumee, Ohio in 2022.

The fleet market is an all-important one for Dana, which has had a bumpy ride over the past several years. If all goes according to plan, the Allison transaction will help Dana keep up with the Joneses as it navigates the fleet industry’s transition to electrification and digitization (see more fleet electrification background here).

Dana already has a head start through its existing relationships in the ICE world. In April, for example, Dana announced that it earned the 2025 Supplier of the Year Award, issued by the leading heavy duty vehicle aftermarket distributor FleetPride.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/electric-vehicle-charging-stations-us-doe.png,N,,2025-07-06 00:01:04.085635

South Carolina, another state expected to see a 13% price hike in annual energy costs with Trump's bill, generates a lot of its electricity from nuclear, with natural gas supplying much of the remainder. Orvis said South Carolina stood to add a lot of solar to its electrical grid with tax incentives, but would have to revert to gas once those credits go away.

""You're going from gas setting that price to renewables, and when you undo the tax credits, you see it reverting back to gas,"" Orvis said.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/mediaos.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cnn-l19jb21wb25lbnrzl2ltywdll2luc3rhbmnlcy9jbwnlc3g1m3ewmdazm2i2b3qxywpty2j3-l19jb21wb25lbnrzl2fydgljbguvaw5zdgfuy2vzl2nty2mybw52adawngsyn3a4nmy4dgj3chopreview-536906187080-09648293265637806.JPG?crop=1xw:0.84459459459459463xh;center,top&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-07-06 01:01:46.295565

Amid rising geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, Japan has received some welcome news on the energy front. Mitsubishi Corporation is preparing to begin importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Canada. These shipments will be primarily destined for the Japanese market.

This will be the first major delivery of Canadian LNG to Japan, which currently depends on Australia and Malaysia for over half of its LNG imports.

With limited domestic energy resources, Japan has been actively working to diversify its LNG supply. Australia, its largest supplier, is projected to face production declines in the coming years. This highlights the need for more stable and reliable sources. Canadian LNG, backed by geographic proximity and political stability, presents a strong alternative. It could play a key role in strengthening Japan's energy security.

Diversifying Japan's LNG Supply

LNG is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state, reducing its volume to about one-600th and making it much easier to transport by sea.

Japan does produce some natural gas domestically, mainly in areas like Niigata and Chiba, but this supply falls far short of meeting national demand. Like oil, Japan relies almost entirely on imports for its natural gas.

With delays in restarting nuclear power plants, Japan remains heavily dependent on thermal power, which generates around 70% of the country's electricity. Gas-fired power plants are the largest contributors.

Compared to other fossil fuels, natural gas produces less CO₂, making it a relatively cleaner option. Because of its key role in electricity generation, any disruption in LNG supply could have serious consequences for the economy and daily life. In fiscal 2024, Japan imported 65.87 million tons of LNG, making it the world's second-largest importer after China.

The LNG Canada Project

The new LNG supply will come from the LNG Canada project in British Columbia, a facility developed with investment from Mitsubishi Corporation, Shell, and other partners. Natural gas is extracted inland and transported via a 670-kilometer pipeline to the coast. There, it is liquefied and shipped overseas by tanker.

The project represents a total investment of about $14 billion USD and has an annual production capacity of 14 million tons. Mitsubishi holds a 15% stake, giving it rights to around 2.1 million tons per year. If all of that were exported to Japan, it would cover roughly a quarter of the country's projected increase in LNG demand.

Mitsubishi's LNG Expertise

Mitsubishi was the first major Japanese trading company to enter the LNG business, beginning in the 1960s. Today, it is involved in LNG projects across more than 10 countries. With the addition of Canadian supply, Mitsubishi's annual LNG production capacity has grown to around 15 million tons, the largest among Japanese companies.

Katsumi Saito, Senior Executive Officer overseeing the fuel business and related operations, commented, ""Our strength lies in the knowledge and development capabilities built on more than 50 years of experience.""

One of the key advantages of Canadian LNG is proximity. Shipping LNG from Canada's west coast to Japan takes about 10 days — much shorter than the roughly 30 days required from the US Gulf Coast via the Panama Canal. That route can take even longer when canal traffic is restricted by drought.

Avoiding Chokepoints and Longer Routes

Other shipping routes, such as around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, can take up to 60 days. LNG from the Middle East typically takes about 16 days. In contrast, Canadian LNG avoids major chokepoints like the Strait of Hormuz, offering more stable and reliable delivery.

Canada also has vast natural gas reserves — enough to meet Japan's current annual LNG demand for about 25 years. Its cold climate makes the liquefaction process more energy-efficient. Canadian LNG has a higher heat content than LNG from the United States. On top of that, there is strong political support in Canada for energy exports, ensuring long-term policy stability.

As of fiscal 2024, Australia supplies 38% of Japan's LNG. Although shipping times from Australia are similar to those from Canada, slower gas field development — driven by climate change policies — has raised concerns about future supply. To reduce risks, Japan has also prioritized LNG imports from the United States, Qatar, which has massive reserves, and Russia.

The US has significantly increased its LNG exports in recent years. Qatar, however, faces geopolitical risks, especially due to tensions with Iran. Japan continues to import LNG from Russia, but new projects have been put on hold under US sanctions. For instance, Japanese trading firms like Mitsui & Co are currently unable to engage with Russia's Arctic LNG 2 project.

Growing Electricity Demand

Japan's electricity demand is expected to grow as the number of data centers increases, driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence technologies. If decarbonization efforts do not progress, the government estimates LNG imports could rise by 12% by 2040, reaching about 74 million tons.

The LNG Canada project marks the first new LNG venture involving Japanese companies in around six years. With global instability highlighting the need for stronger supply chains, Canada's role as a new supplier is a major win for Japan. Further expansion of production capacity is also eagerly anticipated.

The Trump administration's proposed cuts to NOAA are drawing sharp criticism in the wake of devastating floods in Texas that have claimed 27 lives and forced widespread evacuations, particularly in Kerr County. Entire communities have been inundated, and emergency crews are still searching for missing persons, including children.

Several social media users slammed Trump administration.

One person posted on X, “Children are missing in the Texas Hill Country flash flood. Praying for the best. This is not a time to be defunding weather research and NOAA.”

The affected locations include the Las Palmas Community Center, the Starr County Courthouse Annex, and the Sebastian Community Center.

The announcement has added fuel to an already growing controversy surrounding the Trump administration’s approach to emergency management.

On June 10, President Donald Trump stated his intention to phase out FEMA after the 2025 hurricane season.

The legislation eliminates a wide array of clean energy tax credits, including those supporting commercial electric vehicles, alternative fuels, EV charging infrastructure, and energy-efficient building upgrades.

Port officials said the move undercuts the agency’s ability to meet its climate goals.

“The passage of this bill makes the local fight against climate change harder, not easier,” said Port of Seattle Commission President Toshiko Hasegawa. “These credits help us decarbonize our fleet and accelerate green infrastructure investments. While this setback is deeply disappointing, we remain steadfast in our commitments.”

The bill also rescinds Environmental Protection Agency funding created under the Inflation Reduction Act, including grants the Port uses to support the transition of heavy-duty diesel trucks to electric or low-emission alternatives.

“By removing incentives for electrification and clean fuels for trucks, ships, and planes, the big bill is beyond bad for the Port’s and the nation’s ability to combat climate change and create jobs of the future,” said Commissioner Fred Felleman.

Despite its criticisms, the Port acknowledged some positive elements of the legislation, including investments in air traffic control, airport security, and Coast Guard operations that benefit Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and maritime infrastructure.

Justice today filed a new lawsuit ordering the U.S. Department of the Air Force to clean up its toxic PFAS contamination at Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis.

Earlier this year, the New Mexico Legislature delivered House Bill 140 to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who promptly signed it in to law. The new lawsuit relies on existing and expanded authority under the new law.

“After years of contesting responsibility, today’s lawsuit puts every one of the Air Force’s excuses to rest,” said Environment Department Secretary James Kenney. “The Air Force has spent years contesting the Environment Department’s authority as opposed to any meaningful cleanup of the toxic PFAS contamination in local drinking water sources that serve both residents and dairy farmers.”

“PFAS contamination poses a serious and long-term threat to our environment and our communities,” said Attorney General Raúl Torrez. “We are committed to using every legal tool available to hold the federal government accountable for the damage done on the base and the surrounding community and to prevent further harm from these dangerous ‘forever chemicals.’ New Mexicans deserve clean water, safe soil, and a future free from toxic exposure—

and we won’t stop fighting until they get it.”

While New Mexico has contended PFAS was subject to regulation under the Hazardous Waste Act since 2019, the USAF disagreed and filed a lawsuit against the NMED. During the last legislative session, HB 140 was introduced, explicitly designating discarded firefighting foams containing PFAS chemicals as hazardous waste, clarifying state-level regulation even when these

substances aren’t federally listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as such.

For decades, the USAF released PFAS into the environment near Clovis, resulting in a

groundwater plume extending approximately four miles southeast of Cannon AFB. This toxic plume continues to threaten the community and resulted in the euthanizing of 3,500 dairy cows poisoned from drinking contaminated groundwater — devastating local agriculture.

In addition to cleaning up the decades of ongoing PFAS releases and paying civil penalties, the lawsuit seeks to order the USAF to:

End all use of PFAS-containing firefighting foam at Cannon for anything other than

emergency purposes

Provide water treatment systems to residents whose water has been affected by PFAS contamination

Install drinking water lines for any willing residents currently serviced by private wells in the spill area

Hold regular public meetings with the community

Install stormwater controls and retention basins to prevent offsite migration of PFAS

from contaminated media

Valuate nearby private property affected by PFAS contamination

Compensate the owners of said property for losses resulting from PFAS contamination

Analysis - Despite Elon Musk's bold predictions, the Cybertruck is, officially, a flop.

Tesla is deliberately opaque about its sales numbers on specific models, so you have to squint to get a sense of just how badly the company's unique pickup truck is performing in the real world.

But we definitely have some idea.

Here's what we know, based on Tesla's deliveries (a proxy for sales) released this week:

The EV maker delivered about 384,000 vehicles in total, world-wide, between April and June this year - a record 13.5 percent decline from a year earlier.

Zoom in, and it gets uglier for Tesla.

Tesla doesn't break out sales of the Cybertruck, one of its premium models that Musk says was inspired by the dystopian movie ""Blade Runner."" It discloses just two categories - the Model 3 and Y in one category and, in the second, ""other models,"" which is almost entirely the company's legacy Model S sedan, the Model X SUV and the Cybertruck.

The company said it delivered about 10,400 ""other"" models in the second quarter, which itself is a huge problem for Tesla. In the same quarter last year, Tesla sold more than 21,500 ""other"" models.

It's hard to think of another word for a 52 percent decline other than a collapse.

How many of those ""others"" are Cybertrucks, and how many are the Model S or X? That's not entirely clear.

But let's look at the first three months of this year. Tesla sold about 12,900 ""other"" models, of which 7100 were Cybertrucks, according to registration data from S&P Global Mobility. So a bit more than half.

It'd be safe to estimate, then, that Tesla likely sold something in the ballpark of 5000-6000 Cybertrucks in the second quarter if consumer trends held steady. It might even be getting marginally outsold by the F-150 Lightning and GM's electric pickups, rivals whose sales are also falling but weren't nearly as hyped as Musk's brainchild.

The company didn't respond to a request for comment.

But even in a hypothetical world where all of those 10,400 deliveries in the second quarter were Cybertrucks, Tesla would still be massively underperforming the expectations set by Musk, who told investors two years ago that he expected Tesla to be churning out 250,000 a year by 2025.

We're halfway through the year, and Tesla has barely hit a fraction of that.

Cybertruck sales have faced a number of challenges:

Its $80,000-$100,000 price tag

The imminent erasure of EV tax credits

Its oddball design

Repeated recalls, including one for an exterior steel panel falling off while the truck is moving

The roughly 200-mile (322km) real-world range reported by owners, rather than the 500-mile (805km) range that was initially promised

The vehicle's intractable affiliation with the world's wealthiest wannabe-oligarch

Will the Cybertruck's shortcomings sink Tesla? Probably not. But the stumble has become a reflection of the company's broader turmoil.

The electric truck faces serious competition from the likes of Rivian, Ford and GM. Chinese rivals are eating into Tesla's market share in key markets overseas, particularly Europe and China.

Tesla is on the verge of losing its title as the world's largest EV maker by annual sales to Chinese automaker BYD.

This week, BYD - which isn't allowed in the US market - reported 1 million electric vehicles sold in the first half of this year, putting it far ahead of Tesla's year-to-date total of about 721,000.

The Tesla faithful on Wall Street are still all-in on Musk, whom they see as a visionary and, perhaps more to the point, a showman who has made them rich.

Tesla's stock (TSLA) is down about 17 percent this year, but it's up nearly 300 percent over the last five years. For the ride-or-die bulls, it may not matter that Musk's MAGA turn has clobbered the company's core business of selling cars because he has convinced them that Tesla's future lies in an AI-powered, driverless utopia.

And it's Musk's history of promises that have driven that meteoric share price increase, and, accordingly, Musk's personal wealth.

But Musk's promises and predictions routinely come up short. His Cybertruck is only the latest example.",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--Gza3t2Uy--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1751753835/4K4P3FD_AFP__20250605__2218821881__v1__HighRes__TeslaSharesDropOver10AfterMayRally_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-07-05 19:06:03.730943

Good Saturday morning. This is Garrett Ross in the saddle. Get in touch.

DEVASTATING DEVELOPING STORY: “Desperate search for two dozen missing girls from summer camp after Texas floods kill at least 24,” by AP: “Crews searched through the dark early Saturday for two dozen children from a girls’ camp and many others who were still missing after a wall of water rushed down a river in the Texas Hill Country during a powerful storm that killed at least 24 people. The death toll was certain to rise. … The danger was not over as more heavy rains were expected Saturday and flash flood warnings and watches remained in effect for parts of central Texas.”

DRIVING THE DAY

MAKING IT MEGALAW: President Donald Trump signed the sprawling megabill designed to jumpstart his domestic policy agenda into law in a July Fourth ceremony at the White House yesterday.

The scene at 1600 Penn: “Flanked by Republican legislators and members of his Cabinet, Trump signed the multitrillion-dollar legislation outside the White House, and then banged down the gavel that House Speaker Mike Johnson gifted him that was used during the bill’s final passage Thursday,” AP’s Darlene Superville and colleagues write. “The White House was hung with red, white and blue bunting for the Independence Day festivities. The U.S. Marine Band played patriotic marches — and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. There were three separate flyovers.”

What Trump said: “America’s winning, winning, winning like never before,” the president said, also referencing the recent strikes against Iran. “Promises made, promises kept, and we’ve kept them.”

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Here we go again: If the dramatic votes in the House and Senate this week marked the end of a monthslong process of negotiation, infighting and compromise, it also started the clock ticking down the days before Congress has to do it all over again, POLITICO’s Benjamin Guggenheim writes this morning.

Cliff jumping: “That’s because the super-sized domestic policy legislation includes a sharp cliff for tax cuts and deep safety-net restrictions — teeing them up to be the subject of fierce political battles in the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election. The most politically explosive cuts to Medicaid and the nation’s largest food program, for instance, are set to take effect in 2028. Meanwhile, Trump’s most popular tax cuts and a key deduction prized by blue-state Republicans are set to sunset in 2028 and 2029, respectively.”

In a pinch: Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick are the only two Republicans who voted against the bill that are currently top targets for Democrats in 2026. But the structure of the legislation “ensures that the most politically perilous provisions in the bill will remain a hot potato — and an opportunity for moderates — for years to come,” Benjamin writes.

And beyond: The benefit cuts could crop up in the 2028 presidential race, too, when VP JD Vance, who cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate and is seen as a key salesman for it, will likely be vying for the presidency. “Meanwhile, lawmakers in virtually every state will face pressure in 2028 as provisions kick in requiring most states to shoulder part of the costs of federal food aid for the first time.”

BURIED IN THE BILL: POLITICO’s Brian Faler ticks through the series of special tax breaks — costing tens of billions of dollars — that quietly caught a ride on Republicans’ sprawling megabill. Included are carveouts for venture capitalists, Alaskan fisheries, spaceports, private schools, rum makers and others.

“The legislation is primarily designed to prevent $4 trillion in looming tax increases set to hit at the end of this year. But, shortly before approving the plan, Senate Republicans added a new crop of unrelated, bespoke tax breaks. House GOP lawmakers got in their share, too. Many are the sort of narrowly targeted breaks Republicans have long complained are unfair, reward influential special interests and unnecessarily complicate the tax code.”

On immigration: The new law delivers the White House $170 billion for border and immigration enforcement. Now, the timer to spend it all has started, POLITICO’s Myah Ward writes. “The Trump administration has three-and-a-half years to drastically expand the nation’s border enforcement and deportation infrastructure, a massive logistical challenge for which there is no easy comparison.”

And the Trump administration knows it has a major lift ahead of it. “Look, this isn’t easy. Ten thousand ICE officers? Never happened before,” border czar Tom Homan told Myah. “But I’ll say this: It’s about time … with more money, we can do more.”

THE RESPONSE: The general consensus from blue state governors and lawmakers boils down to: Sit tight for now and blame Republicans, POLITICO’s Natalie Fertig reports. “Congress’ Medicaid cuts came as dozens of state legislatures dried the ink on their own annual budgets and adjourned — some for the summer, many for the year. But in the face of a funding chasm no state can bridge, uncertainty over the effects of the cuts and the view that Republicans will take the lion’s share of the blame, many blue states are opting to wait and see before trying to solve a problem they didn’t create.”

The real-world impact: With the bill now signed into law, state governments are already “bracing for impact as Washington shifts much of the burden for health care, food assistance and other programs onto them,” NYT’s David Chen and Pooja Salhotra report.

“Even before the bill’s final passage, state capitals were contending with a slowing economy and federal spending cuts implemented by the Department of Government Efficiency run by Elon Musk. Now they will be expected to administer complex new work requirements for Medicaid and food aid; rework some state health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act; and decide how much they can do to keep their citizens insured and fed once they start losing federal assistance.”

THE REALITY CHECK: Despite Trump’s insistence that he’s ushering in an era of success that hasn’t been seen in “decades,” as he said at the White House yesterday, there are plenty of signs that — much like the cliffs built into his coveted new law — there is uncertain terrain on the horizon.

On the megabill: Passing the megabill was the hard part. Now comes the other hard part: Selling it to an American public. Despite the months of debate inside the beltway, voters are still deeply unfamiliar with everything that’s in the new law and how it will impact communities across the country, WSJ’s Aaron Zitner and colleagues report.

“Polls show that the bill is unpopular. Opposition outweighed support by more than 20 percentage points in recent Fox News and Quinnipiac University polls. Some Republican lawmakers facing tough races next year represent the most Medicaid-reliant districts. They will have to defend the big cuts in the bill to Medicaid, the health-insurance program for low-income and disabled people, as well as to rural hospitals and to nutrition assistance, once known as food stamps. Those cuts help fund tax cuts in the bill that President Trump called for during the 2024 campaign.”

On the economy: Though there have been some gains (and wins for Trump) in recent economic readings, the long-term view is still extremely unclear, WaPo’s Rachel Lerman reports.

“Gross domestic product shrank in the first quarter of the year in part because of surging imports, and consumers are feeling hesitant and spending less. It’s also too soon to know the full effect of Trump’s widespread tariffs, especially with a deadline approaching to get deals completed with many countries before levies rise once more. And as immigrants leave the workforce, either voluntarily or by deportation, a lack of workers could create labor shortages in certain key areas and fuel wage inflation.”

TURNING ATTENTION: A handful of top Trump officials will be on the Sunday show circuit tomorrow to talk up the new megalaw and the economy. Their messaging will come as we enter a week that is likely to be dominated with headlines regarding Trump’s trade agenda as he tries to secure more deals with major trading partners ahead of his July 9 deadline, when his so-called reciprocal tariffs are set to snap back into effect. Wall Street is warily watching, Reuters notes.

If it seems like there’s little to show from the White House on the trade front thus far, that’s not worrying those inside the administration. Just last week, Trump said “we can do whatever we want” regarding the looming deadline. That ambivalence has been a hallmark of negotiations, POLITICO’s Daniel Desrochers and Megan Messerly write. “And it highlights an important tension of Trump’s second administration: The president’s long-standing affinity for imposing tariffs is clashing with his reputation as a canny dealmaker.”

The scramble: “Foreign officials, trade experts, lawmakers and even some White House allies have expressed a nihilistic view of the July deadline, questioning whether a deal with the Trump administration means anything at all given the president’s penchant for using tariffs as leverage to get his way.”

Quite the quote: “Trump knows the most interesting part of his presidency is the tariff conversation,” a person close to the White House told Daniel and Megan. “I find it hard to believe he’s going to surrender it that easily. It’s all fake. There’s no deadline. It’s a self-imposed landmark in this theatrical show, and that’s where we are.”

9 THINGS THAT STUCK WITH US

1. KICKIN’ IT: For all of Trump’s “America First” rhetoric, there is at least one playing field where that message doesn’t translate, POLITICO’s Sophia Cai reports. As the U.S. prepares to play host to the 2026 World Cup, the administration’s efforts offer “a vision of an alternate Trump administration.” It’s a natural posture for Trump, who “has long gravitated personally to the testosterone and glitz of athletic competition.”

How it’s playing: “The White House welcomes foreign visitors and maintains harmonious relations with neighboring countries. It works closely with international organizations and serves as a supportive, even solicitous, partner to leaders in Democratic-run states and cities. It is an exception to ‘America First’ large enough to kick a ball through.” Andrew Giuliani, who leads a task force on World Cup preparations, told Sophia that the “largest World Cup in history will be both secure and welcoming,” adding that the U.S. will be “proud to open our doors to fans from around the world and one of the goals of the task force is to ensure that international fans can be a part of this historic sporting event.”

2. IMMIGRATION FILES: The Trump administration has deported eight men to South Sudan today, CBS’ Camilo Montoya-Galvez reports. A federal judge late yesterday blocked a last-ditch effort to keep the men in Djibouti, POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney write, as U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ruled the Supreme Court already had the final say. Also yesterday, a six year old Honduran boy sick with leukemia who was arrested in May and held in an ICE detention center in Texas is now back in Los Angeles, NBC’s Corky Siemaszko writes.

The big picture: Grassroots immigrant rights organizations are only growing across the country, predominantly in LA, NYT’s Jazmine Ulloa and Miriam Jordan report. “We are not trying to use violence,” said Ron Gochez, the leader of one such group, “but what is happening to our community is completely violent.”

3. RUSSIA-UKRAINE LATEST: Trump held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday, which Zelenskyy described as a “very important and fruitful conversation.” But securing a ceasefire appears to still be out of reach as Russia continues to spurn negotiations to end the war. “We talked about different things. We had a very good call, I think a very strategic call,” Trump said. Zelenskyy’s readout of the call said the leaders discussed Ukraine’s air defense, Friday’s attacks and “mutual procurement and investment.” More from POLITICO’s Gigi Ewing

Still unclear: The state of air defense missiles. Zelenskyy’s readout said the leaders “agreed to work on increasing the protection of Ukrainian skies” but didn’t specify beyond that, NYT’s Andrew Kramer reports from Kyiv. But Bloomberg’s Michael Nienaber reported yesterday that Germany is in talks with the US to get Ukraine two more Patriot air-defense systems. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte is calling for U.S. “flexibility” to make sure Ukraine can continue to fight back, Bloomberg’s Andrea Palasciano writes.

On the ground: Putin’s offensive push continues. Russia attacked Ukraine overnight with over 300 drones, injuring 11, ABC’s Natalya Kushnir reports this morning. But Ukraine is pushing back hard, striking Russia’s “home base” for its military fighter jets earlier this AM, Bloomberg’s Olesia Safronova reports.

4. A NEW HOPE: Israeli ministers are meeting tonight on the next steps forward on a ceasefire with Gaza, NYT’s Aaron Boxerman and colleagues report. Hamas responded positively yesterday to the U.S.-backed 60-day ceasefire proposal that got Israel’s stamp of approval earlier this week, NYT’s Adam Rasgon and Ephrat Livni write. Hamas said it’s ready to start negotiations on the proposal, which includes hostage and prisoner swaps and a potential permanent end of fighting. Grain of salt: “It was not immediately clear whether Hamas was demanding any significant changes to the proposal,” per NYT.

What Trump is saying: “That’s good. They haven’t briefed me on it,” Trump said last night when asked about Hamas’ positive reaction. “There could be a Gaza deal next week,” he added, saying he’s optimistic but “it changes from day to day.” Still to come: Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House on Monday.

5. IRAN LATEST: The UN’s nuclear inspectors left Iran yesterday after the country stopped cooperating with the international watchdog, NYT’s Erika Solomon writes, “at a particularly critical moment, when experts are warning that the attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities may simply drive the country to take its program underground.” Meanwhile, European officials are saying the U.S. strikes heavily set back Iran’s nuclear proliferation but didn’t “obliterate” it, sharing concerns that any future negotiations with Iran may have been wrecked instead, per WaPo’s Ellen Francis.

6. TIKTOK ON THE CLOCK: Trump told reporters last night that “we pretty much have a deal” to sell social media app TikTok. “We’re going to start Monday or Tuesday talking to China. … [W]e probably have to get it approved by China. Not definitely but probably,” Trump said. A deal has been in the works for months, as Chinese owner ByteDance stares down a September deadline (which Trump has repeatedly unilaterally extended) to sell the app or shut down US operations, per Reuters.

7. SCOTUS PALACE INTRIGUE: “Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson Makes Herself Heard, Prompting a Rebuke,” by NYT’s Adam Liptak: “Jackson wrote just five majority opinions in the Supreme Court term that ended last month … But her voice resonated nonetheless, in an unusually large number of concurring and dissenting opinions … Several of them warned that the court was taking lawless shortcuts, placing a judicial thumb on the scale in favor of President Trump and putting American democracy in peril. … Her opinions, sometimes joined by no other justice, have been the subject of scornful criticism from the right and have raised questions about her relationships with her fellow justices.”

8. A NEW YORK MINUTE: “Mamdani Once Claimed to Be Asian and African American. Should It Matter?” by NYT’s Dodai Stewart: “Three of his rivals in New York City’s mayoral race have strongly criticized [Zohran] Mamdani, with two suggesting potential fraud and calling for further investigation. … Right-wing pundits have flocked to social media to call Mr. Mamdani a liar — and worse. … And his supporters have rallied to his defense, angrily characterizing the disclosure as a politically motivated hit job with no bearing on the mayor’s race.”

9. MEDIAWATCH: “How Paramount’s $16-million Trump settlement came together — and could’ve fallen apart,” by the LA Times’ Meg James: “The deal resulted from months of back-and-forth among a constellation of power players with competing interests … The settlement, which the president approved late Tuesday, included a commitment by Trump to drop his claims and not sue over the May ‘60 Minutes’ broadcast … The eight-month skirmish with Trump shined a harsh light on Paramount’s vulnerabilities — and deep divisions within the company and its prospective new owners. … ‘This [settlement] was all about survival — it was that dark.’”

Nothing to wait for guidance on because “new” is already defined in the tax code and means exactly what you think it does—original purchase being placed into service and registered for the first time. A lease buyout does not qualify.

The Department of Environmental Protection today announced the availability of more than $5 million in grants under two new programs designed to enhance stormwater management in New Jersey’s communities, building upon the Murphy Administration’s historic commitment to climate resilience.

The grant programs are part of the Murphy Administration’s groundbreaking $20 million Ready to Be Resilient Stormwater and Resilience Funding Program, launched last year to spur modernization of stormwater infrastructure and management strategies in the face of increased precipitation resulting from a warming climate.

The DEP is making nearly $3.7 million available to help counties map existing stormwater infrastructure and for planning activities related to projects that include green infrastructure, as well as another $1.35 million in grants to promote stormwater management compliance for public entities at their wood-waste recycling and leaf-composting facilities.

“Much of New Jersey’s stormwater infrastructure is very outdated and not up to the task of managing precipitation and flooding that are increasing as a result of climate change,” said Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette. “Through these two new grant programs, the DEP continues to modernize how communities in New Jersey manage stormwater.”

Green Streets & Stormwater Infrastructure Mapping Grant Program ($3,675,000)

The DEP is making funding available to promote stormwater management and increased resilience within communities through green stormwater infrastructure (i.e., green streets) and stormwater infrastructure mapping. The source of the funding is the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

All counties are eligible to apply. Grant funding will be divided equally among each of the counties. The minimum awarded amount is $175,000 ($75,000 for green streets and $100,000 for stormwater infrastructure mapping).

Should not all counties apply for this grant funding, the remaining funds will be added proportionately to each eligible grant applicant’s award up to a maximum total award of $350,000 ($150,000 for green streets and $200,000 for stormwater infrastructure mapping).

Funding for green street projects can be utilized for any planning activities related to green infrastructure along a county road that is located within a disadvantaged community as listed on the Environmental Justice Mapping, Assessment and Protection (EJMAP) Tool link found at https://dep.nj.gov/ej/resources/.

A completed project plan must be submitted to the DEP to receive the final disbursement of funds. Additionally, reimbursement may be sought for a previous project that meets these criteria.

Funding for stormwater infrastructure mapping can be utilized for expenses incurred to meet the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) infrastructure map requirement of the Highway Agency MS4 permit issued to each county. A complete or partially complete MS4 infrastructure map must be submitted to the DEP to receive the final disbursement of funds.

Applicants who have already incurred costs towards completion of their stormwater infrastructure mapping may be eligible for reimbursement for incurred costs up to the amount of funding dispersed under the grant.

For detailed requirements, questions and to apply visit: https://dep.nj.gov/wlm/grants/swgrant/

Leaf Composting Grant Program ($1,350,000)

The purpose of this grant funding is to promote stormwater management compliance at wood waste recycling and leaf composting facilities. This funding will be provided to assist public entities that are authorized to operate facilities under the New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJDPES) Wood Waste Recycling and Leaf Composting (WRC) Stormwater General Permit.

This program, also funded by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, applies to public facilities where clean wood waste such as branches and brush is chipped or where grass clippings, leaves, and wood chips are composted. For more information, including eligibility requirements, see wrc_final_permit.pdf

This opportunity is only open to public entities that are authorized to operate facilities under a valid WRC general permit authorization or to public applicants who qualify and apply for the WRC authorization on or before August 1, 2025. Applications for the WRC permit are available at https://dep.nj.gov/dwq/permitting_information/permits_application_forms_and_checklists/ – DST.

The DEP will distribute the available $1.35 million grant fund evenly among all qualified applicants. Should additional money become available, it will be evenly distributed to those that applied, or an additional future funding opportunity may be offered.",https://mercerme.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stony_brook_flooding_mine_rd_pennington-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 20:06:01.845212

The legislation eliminates a wide array of clean energy tax credits, including those supporting commercial electric vehicles, alternative fuels, EV charging infrastructure, and energy-efficient building upgrades.

Port officials said the move undercuts the agency’s ability to meet its climate goals.

“The passage of this bill makes the local fight against climate change harder, not easier,” said Port of Seattle Commission President Toshiko Hasegawa. “These credits help us decarbonize our fleet and accelerate green infrastructure investments. While this setback is deeply disappointing, we remain steadfast in our commitments.”

The bill also rescinds Environmental Protection Agency funding created under the Inflation Reduction Act, including grants the Port uses to support the transition of heavy-duty diesel trucks to electric or low-emission alternatives.

“By removing incentives for electrification and clean fuels for trucks, ships, and planes, the big bill is beyond bad for the Port’s and the nation’s ability to combat climate change and create jobs of the future,” said Commissioner Fred Felleman.

Despite its criticisms, the Port acknowledged some positive elements of the legislation, including investments in air traffic control, airport security, and Coast Guard operations that benefit Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and maritime infrastructure.

The Hyundai IONIQ 6 is an electric vehicle known for its long range and high-performing battery. Despite this, the IONIQ 6 hasn't been selling well in the U.S. According to Car Scoops, sales of the EV dropped 57% in September 2024 as compared to the same month in 2023.

""Ultimately, the [IONIQ] 6 suffers for being a sedan in a crossover-crazed market,"" wrote Inside EVs.

Earlier this year, Hyundai announced the new updates to the IONIQ 6 at the Seoul Mobility Show.

""IONIQ 6 has evolved from a single Electrified Streamliner into a lineup, each model expressing its own character while staying true to one refined vision,"" said Simon Loasby, senior vice president and head of Hyundai Design Center. ""Under the evolved design concept of 'Pure Flow, Refined', we've enhanced every line and detail to make IONIQ 6 simpler and more progressive.""

Some of the new upgrades to the IONIQ 6 include a charge range of 353 miles, certified by the South Korean Ministry of Environment. As Electrek reports, this could be up to 430 miles of range based on the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) scale, which measures all global test levels of traffic patterns, fuel emissions, and more.

""Range is one thing that we know a lot of consumers care about,"" said Alex Knizek, auto testing manager at Consumer Reports. ""Charging anxiety becomes a prominent thing — a charger might be broken or maybe charging at a lower rate than advertised.""

The new mileage range of the IONIQ 6 could help alleviate that anxiety in potential EV buyers and shows the capability for upgrading EV range mileage.

The new IONIQ 6 also features an upgraded battery and built-in charging capabilities with Tesla superchargers, the largest and fastest global network of EV charging ports.

""This could be a huge stress relief by minimizing the steps involved in charging,"" wrote Inside EVs.

Some of the other enhancements in the IONIQ 6 include a refined console, easier climate control, and a redesigned steering wheel for more comfort and user experience.

Electric vehicles are becoming more common on the streets. For drivers, EVs help reduce harmful pollution from traditional gas-powered cars. And drivers can save money on fuel.

Estimates from the Department of Energy indicate that drivers can save up to $2,200 a year on fully electric vehicles and up to $1,500 on a hybrid electric vehicle. These savings can be even greater with solar panels, which can decrease the cost of charging your vehicle at home. You can find and compare solar quotes in your area with this free and easy tool from EnergySage.

EV sales have risen by 10% year-over-year. Because of the increase in demand for EVs, automakers are increasing production of hybrid and fully-electric vehicles. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), about 17.3 million EVs were made in 2024, 25% more than in 2023. Hyundai is also ramping up production of the IONIQ 6 with hopes that the new upgrades could bring in new EV drivers.

""For anyone who enjoys a good road trip and doesn't want to stop to charge, the Ioniq 6 should be the way to go,"" wrote Patrick George of Inside EVs.

“We are waiting for the projects to come forward so we can say… match the project with the money,” Justin Friedman told Anadolu Agency on the sidelines of the 11th Nuclear Power Plants Summit in Istanbul, held July 1-2.

“They are ready to go; we just need good projects to come,” he added.

Friedman said the US Export-Import Bank and the US International Development Finance Corporation have already issued letters of interest worth more than $17 billion for nuclear projects in Romania and Poland and are now looking at Türkiye.

“I know they are exploring opportunities here in Türkiye and have programs to help, particularly SMRs, move forward,” he added.

First nuclear power plant

Türkiye is building its first nuclear power plant, the four-unit Akkuyu project on the Mediterranean coast, in partnership with Russia’s state nuclear agency, Rosatom. Once fully operational, the plant is expected to supply about 10 percent of Türkiye’s electricity demand for at least 60 years.

Ankara also plans large-scale plants in Sinop on the Black Sea and in the northwestern Thrace region, targeting 20 gigawatts of installed nuclear capacity by 2050. Officials are also evaluating SMRs as part of the country’s long-term energy mix.

Friedman, who previously served as political counselor at the US Embassy in Ankara between 2014 and 2017, said there is natural potential for cooperation between US and Turkish companies in the SMR sector.

“Turkish companies already, today, are providing parts, supplies, and services for nuclear projects outside of Türkiye,” he said. “It is only natural that US companies would want to seek that expertise and take advantage of it as they explore projects here in Türkiye.”

‘Ambitious goal’

Collaborating on nuclear energy could help 2 countries strengthen partnership, Friedman says, describing this as an “exciting time” for the global nuclear sector, noting that US President Donald Trump has set a target of adding 400 gigawatts of nuclear capacity in the US by 2050. “That is a very ambitious goal, and that is why the US is in the lead around the world,” he said.

He added that Washington sees nuclear cooperation as a key pillar of its broader strategic relationship with Ankara. “Nuclear is a piece of that. And we are hoping that by working together on the nuclear energy issue, we can extend and grow our partnership,” he said.

Friedman said the US and Türkiye are “deep friends and good partners” and expressed hope that nuclear cooperation would continue to grow. “We see indications on both sides that we want to move forward, and I am just happy to be here to be part of that,” he said.

When asked whether a bilateral nuclear agreement could be expected soon, Friedman said: “I hope for a deal soon. I hope to be part of the team that develops that deal.

For investors, the path forward is clear: hedge against fiscal austerity risks while preparing for political gridlock.","The sudden emergence of Elon Musk's proposed “America Party” has thrust the U.S. political system into a rare moment of instability, with implications far beyond Capitol Hill. Musk's vow to form a centrist party in response to President Donald Trump's $3.3 trillion “One Big Beautiful Bill” has exposed deep fissures in bipartisan fiscal discipline. For investors, the question is no longer whether Musk's party will succeed—but how its mere existence could upend sectors reliant on federal spending, from electric vehicles to defense contractors.

The Political Tightrope: Fiscal Austerity vs. Entrenched Spending

Musk's party is less a fully formed movement than a threat to disrupt the bipartisan consensus that has enabled decades of deficit spending. The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which Musk opposes as fiscally irresponsible, includes expanded healthcare subsidies, infrastructure spending, and tax cuts—all funded by borrowing. Musk's counterproposal, however, remains vague, focusing narrowly on fiscal conservatism.

The party's greatest leverage may lie in its ability to splinter Republican support for Trump's agenda. A June 2025 poll by Quantus Insights found that 57% of male Republican voters would consider backing the America Party, potentially derailing the president's legislative priorities. Yet Musk's net favorability rating of -18% and legal hurdles—such as California's requirement of 75,000 registered members to qualify for the ballot—suggest the party's success is far from assured.

Sector Risks: Fiscal Austerity's Bullseye

The America Party's stated focus on reducing the national debt (now over $40 trillion) creates clear winners and losers among debt-driven industries:

Electric Vehicles (EVs):

Musk's Tesla is caught in a paradox. The bill phases out EV tax credits by 2026, which Tesla CEO Musk opposes, advocating instead for a gradual wind-down. A fiscal conservative shift could accelerate cuts to subsidies, hitting Tesla's margins. Meanwhile, EV infrastructure firms like ChargePoint, which rely less on direct subsidies, appear more resilient.

Tesla's share price has fallen 25% since the bill's House passage in July 2024, reflecting market anxiety over subsidy erosion.

Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals:

The bill's expanded Medicare benefits and drug price controls are nonstarters for fiscal hawks. A successful America Party could pressure lawmakers to scale back these provisions, reducing revenue for companies like Pfizer or UnitedHealthcare.

Defense and Aerospace:

Bipartisan support for military spending may insulate firms like Lockheed Martin, but cost-cutting in other areas (e.g., space exploration subsidies) could hurt companies tied to Musk's own ventures, such as SpaceX.

Investment Strategy: Navigating Fiscal Crosscurrents

The key variable is whether the America Party's mere existence forces gridlock that limits spending, or whether it fails, allowing the bill to proceed unimpeded. Here's how to position portfolios:

Equities:

Short Tesla (TSLA): Its valuation hinges on subsidies and high debt levels. A fiscal austerity push would amplify headwinds.

Long EV Infrastructure: Firms like ChargePoint (CHPT) or EVgo (EVGO), which benefit from secular adoption trends, are less subsidy-dependent.

Avoid High-Debt Firms: Companies with weak balance sheets (e.g., healthcare providers with high leverage) face rising financing costs if austerity reduces federal support.

Fixed Income:

Treasuries (TLT): If gridlock delays the bill, lower inflation expectations could boost bond prices.

Gold (GLD): A prolonged political stalemate might drive safe-haven demand.

Bets on Gridlock:

Consider inverse ETFs like SPP (which profits from market volatility) or options straddles on key sectors.

Political Realities: Why the Party May Stall—But Still Matter

The America Party's success faces three towering obstacles:

1. Structural Barriers: Forming a national party requires navigating 50 states' ballot access rules. For example, Ohio mandates 50,000 signatures by September 2025—no small feat for a fledgling movement.

2. Voter Loyalty: Third parties rarely succeed in a two-party system. Even Ross Perot's 19% vote share in 1992 didn't translate into lasting influence.

3. Musk's Brand: His polarizing persona—47% of Americans view him unfavorably—limits broad appeal.

Yet the party's mere existence could force fiscal discipline. Already, Senate Republicans have signaled openness to deficit-cutting measures to avoid losing seats to Musk's faction. This creates a “threat premium” for markets: even if the party fails, its leverage may curb spending, favoring sectors that thrive in leaner fiscal environments.

Conclusion: A Crossroads for Fiscal Policy—and Markets

Musk's America Party is a gamble, not a sure bet. But its emergence underscores a growing unease with debt-driven policymaking. For investors, the path forward is clear: hedge against fiscal austerity risks while preparing for political gridlock. The next six months will test whether Musk's party is a flash in the pan—or a seismic shift in U.S. fiscal priorities. Either way, the crosshairs are already on industries that depend on the government's open checkbook.",,N,,2025-07-05 18:05:09.026694

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks.
The Transportation Department’s memorandum on June 6 said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.
Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.
The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.","DETROIT (AP) — Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a rule that Biden-era fuel economy standards for gas-powered cars and trucks are illegal and moved to reverse them, paving the way for a likely reset of rules.

Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation’s use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

The moves align with the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to slash federal support for EVs.

President Donald Trump has pledged to end what he has called an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to former President Joe Biden’s target for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. EVs do not use gasoline or emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell — or car buyers to purchase — EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks. He included use of EVs in calculating the rules — an inclusion the Trump administration and the auto industry have argued was illegal and raised the bar too high for automakers to meet.

The Transportation Department’s memorandum on June 6 said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.

“We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States,” Duffy said.

The revised rule does not itself change existing standards, but it empowers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make adjustments in coming months.

Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.

Under the Biden administration, automakers were required to average about 50 miles per gallon of gas by 2031 — up from about 39 miles per gallon for light-duty vehicles today — in an effort to save almost 70 billion gallons of gasoline through 2050.

The rules, finalized in 2024, increased fuel economy 2% per year for passenger cars in every model year from 2027 to 2031 and 2% each year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031.

Mileage rules — in place since the 1970s energy crisis — work alongside the Environmental Protection Agency limits on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation’s planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.

In recent years, automakers have been manufacturing gasoline-fueled cars that are more efficient and get higher mileage.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents automakers, called Duffy’s announcement “a positive development” that adds “important clarity” to federal mileage rules.

The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department’s action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

“Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,” she said. “It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.”

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the pending budget bill that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don’t meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Automakers can buy regulatory credits under a trading program if they don’t meet the standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don’t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers.

The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.

The memo and bill text landed as Tesla owner Elon Musk and Trump engaged in a public spat online, with Trump suggesting that Musk “only developed a problem” with his budget bill because it rolls back tax credits for EVs.

Implications for EV Owners and Industry For EV owners, the loss of tax credits increases purchase costs, potentially making gas-powered vehicles more competitive in the short term.
Upcoming Treasury guidance on battery credits and court rulings on ZEV mandates will be critical in shaping the industry’s path.","President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” slated for signing in the coming days, delivers a seismic shift to electric vehicle (EV) incentives, Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credit systems, and clean energy policies. This legislation, detailed by EV industry analyst Sawyer Merritt, reshapes the landscape for EV owners, automakers, and enthusiasts, balancing new opportunities with significant challenges.

EV Tax Credits Face a Hard Deadline

The bill terminates the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs on September 30, 2025. These credits have been pivotal in making vehicles like the Tesla Model Y or Nissan Leaf more affordable, often reducing upfront costs by thousands. For perspective, the $7,500 credit could cover roughly 10% of a $75,000 Rivian R1S or nearly 20% of a $40,000 Chevrolet Bolt. After September 2025, buyers will bear the full cost, potentially slowing EV adoption, especially among middle-income households. Notably, earlier concerns about a $250 annual EV fee are dispelled, as the bill contains no such provision, offering relief to current and prospective owners.

ZEV Credit Market on the Brink

The ZEV credit system, a financial lifeline for EV manufacturers like Tesla, faces a near-total collapse under the new law. Previously, automakers failing to meet federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards faced hefty fines, incentivizing them to buy ZEV credits from companies producing EVs. The bill eliminates these penalties, reducing fines to $0, which Sawyer Merritt notes “removes a major incentive to purchase credits.”

Compounding this, Congress recently used the Congressional Review Act to revoke EPA waivers that allowed California and 17 other states to enforce stricter emissions rules, including ZEV mandates. “Without these waivers, states can no longer require automakers to meet ZEV sales targets or buy ZEV credits to comply,” Merritt explains. These waivers underpinned state-level ZEV programs, creating a robust market where Tesla earned billions by selling credits to legacy automakers like Ford or GM. With both federal and state compliance pressures gone, demand for ZEV credits in the U.S. is likely to plummet, though Tesla can still generate credits in markets like Europe. Legal battles to restore the waivers are expected, but their outcome remains uncertain.

Battery Manufacturing Credits: A Mixed Bag

The bill preserves the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, providing $35 per kilowatt-hour for battery cells and $10 per kilowatt-hour for modules. This supports domestic production at facilities like Tesla’s Giga Nevada (in partnership with Panasonic), Giga Texas, and the new Nevada LFP battery plant. For example, a 100 kWh battery pack could yield a $4,500 credit ($3,500 for cells + $1,000 for modules), bolstering U.S. manufacturing. However, new sourcing restrictions complicate eligibility. Batteries must contain 60% U.S. content in 2026, increasing to 85% by 2030. Merritt cautions, “If the plant uses CATL equipment, it will be tough,” highlighting challenges for facilities reliant on Chinese technology. The U.S. Treasury is expected to issue guidance clarifying these requirements, which could ease compliance concerns for manufacturers.

New Deduction for U.S.-Made Vehicles

A novel tax deduction allows buyers of American-assembled vehicles to deduct up to $10,000 annually in loan interest from 2025 to 2028. Eligible vehicles, including EVs, must have final assembly in the U.S., a gross vehicle weight under 14,000 pounds (6,350 kilograms), and be cars, SUVs, pickups, minivans, vans, or motorcycles. Models like the Ford F-150 Lightning or Lucid Air qualify, but the deduction phases out for single filers earning over $100,000 or joint filers above $200,000. For a $50,000 loan at 5% interest, this could save buyers roughly $2,500 annually, making U.S.-built EVs more attractive despite the loss of tax credits.

Broader Clean Energy Rollbacks

Beyond EVs, the bill curtails clean energy incentives, impacting the broader transition to sustainable technologies. The 30% tax credit for rooftop solar ends December 31, 2025, potentially increasing installation costs by thousands (e.g., a $20,000 solar system loses $6,000 in savings). Tax credits for geothermal heat pumps, energy-efficient home improvements, and new energy-efficient homes also expire by mid-2026. The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit, which supports EV charging infrastructure, ends June 30, 2026, potentially slowing the expansion of public charging networks. For instance, installing a Level 2 charger (costing $500–$2,000) will lose up to 30% in federal support.

The bill also phases out clean electricity production and investment credits for wind and solar projects entering service after 2027, a blow to renewable energy. Projects must begin construction within a year of enactment or come online by 2027 to qualify. New restrictions disqualify facilities using components from China, complicating supply chains. Nuclear, geothermal, and battery storage projects have more time, but the overall reduction in clean energy support could hinder U.S. progress toward carbon neutrality.

Implications for EV Owners and Industry

For EV owners, the loss of tax credits increases purchase costs, potentially making gas-powered vehicles more competitive in the short term. A Tesla Model 3 Long Range, priced around $47,000, loses $7,500 in savings post-2025, pushing the effective cost to $54,500. This could deter budget-conscious buyers, slowing EV market growth. However, the loan interest deduction and retained battery manufacturing credits offer some relief, particularly for those buying U.S.-built models.

For automakers, the collapse of the ZEV credit market disrupts revenue streams, especially for Tesla, which reported $1.79 billion in regulatory credit revenue in 2024. Companies may scale back EV production if demand weakens, focusing instead on hybrids or internal combustion engine vehicles. The battery credit’s domestic sourcing rules incentivize U.S. manufacturing but risk supply chain bottlenecks if foreign components are phased out too quickly. Regulatory uncertainty, particularly around ZEV mandate litigation, complicates long-term planning.

Economically, the bill aligns with domestic manufacturing goals, potentially creating jobs in battery and vehicle production. However, reduced clean energy incentives could cede ground to countries like China, which dominates global EV and solar markets. Operationally, EV owners may face challenges if charging infrastructure growth slows due to the loss of refueling credits, particularly in rural areas where stations are sparse.

Looking Ahead: Navigating a New Era

EV owners and enthusiasts must act swiftly to leverage remaining incentives. Those planning to buy should aim for purchases before September 2025 to secure tax credits. Businesses leasing EVs lose their commercial clean vehicle credit on the same date, potentially raising lease costs. The shift toward U.S.-centric policies offers opportunities for domestic manufacturers but risks stalling the broader EV ecosystem. Upcoming Treasury guidance on battery credits and court rulings on ZEV mandates will be critical in shaping the industry’s path.

The bill reflects a pivot away from federal support for electrification, prioritizing economic nationalism over environmental goals. While EV adoption will continue, driven by state policies and private innovation, the road ahead is bumpier. Owners and automakers alike must adapt to a landscape with fewer subsidies but new opportunities for American-made vehicles.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 18:05:16.839562

As courts and policymakers weigh competing interests, investors face a critical question: Can this $6 billion project, pivotal to Maryland's clean energy goals, withstand the legal and political headwinds it faces?

The Legal Battlefield: Five Claims That Could Sink or Save the Project

On July 2, 2025, a federal court handed a partial victory to Ocean City and its allies by allowing five major legal claims to proceed against US Wind's project. The lawsuit, filed under the Endangered Species Act, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and National Historic Preservation Act, accuses the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) of failing to adequately assess environmental risks. At the center of the dispute is the potential harm to endangered North Atlantic Right Whales, whose migration routes could be disrupted by turbine construction.

The plaintiffs argue that BOEM's approval process ignored these risks, while US Wind and the state of Maryland counter that rigorous environmental reviews—including seasonal construction bans and real-time acoustic monitoring—mitigate harm. A trial outcome could delay or even invalidate the project's federal permits, which were finalized in December 2024.

Political Crosswinds: Federal Policy and State-Specific Conflicts

The project's viability hinges not only on courtroom outcomes but also on shifting federal priorities. President Donald Trump's January 2025 executive order pausing offshore wind lease sales and permitting has cast doubt on the timeline. The administration argues that the pause is necessary to reassess environmental and economic impacts, but critics—including 17 states, including Maryland—see it as a politically motivated blow to renewable energy progress.

Meanwhile, Delaware's Sussex County adds another layer of uncertainty. The county denied a permit for a critical onshore substation in 2023, but state lawmakers are pushing legislation to strip local authorities of their permitting power. If passed, this would clear a path for US Wind's infrastructure but risk further alienating coastal communities already skeptical of the project's benefits.

Investment Implications: Navigating Risk and Reward

For investors, the Maryland project exemplifies the high-stakes calculus of renewable energy investments. On one hand, the project's success would deliver 2,200 MW of clean energy, fulfilling 40% of Maryland's 2035 clean energy mandate and creating 2,600 jobs. US Wind's partnerships with local manufacturers, such as a $150 million monopile plant in Sparrows Point, also underscore its economic multiplier effect.

On the other hand, the risks are acute. A prolonged legal battle or federal policy reversal could delay the project's 2029 commercial operations date, increasing costs and diluting returns. Equity investors in US Wind's parent company, Renexia, have already faced volatility tied to permit delays and regulatory uncertainty.

Investment Advice:

- Short-Term Holders: Avoid direct exposure to US Wind/Renexia until legal and regulatory risks crystallize. Monitor the July 14, 2025, judicial review deadline and the Delaware substation bill's progress.

- Long-Term Plays: Consider broader renewable energy ETFs (e.g., ICLN) or utilities with diversified portfolios (e.g., NextEra Energy (NEE)) to mitigate project-specific risk.

- Policy Watchers: Track federal litigation over Trump's executive order; a court rebuke could reignite investor confidence in offshore wind.

Conclusion: A Litmus Test for Clean Energy's Future

The Ocean City project is more than a single investment opportunity—it's a test of whether the U.S. can balance climate goals with local autonomy. Investors must weigh the project's potential to deliver on decarbonization against the real risks of regulatory and legal setbacks. For now, patience and diversification remain the safest strategies.

The next 12 months will be decisive. If US Wind can navigate the courts and Delaware's politics while federal permitting rules stabilize, this project could become a blueprint for offshore wind's expansion. Fail, and it may deter capital from similarly contentious coastal developments. The offshore wind sector's growth hinges on resolving these crosscurrents—and investors would do well to watch closely.",,N,,2025-07-06 06:02:20.794382

The plan is a requirement set by the 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act to publish a new framework every four years for tackling the climate crisis. The 2025 plan could guide legislative action on helping Vermonters, especially those with low or moderate incomes, adopt more efficient and less polluting sources of home heat and transportation, the two highest-emitting sectors in the state.

Other priorities included mitigating future climate hazards, building a climate-ready workforce, weatherizing an additional 79,000 homes, reducing or sequestering emissions on farmland and finding funding to implement all these ideas.

While Vermont files its second Climate Action Plan to try and meet legally-binding emissions reductions, federal funding programs that made possible climate initiatives in small states like this one are on the chopping block. Now, as the state looks for other sources of revenue and support to achieve its climate goals, the new plan lays out what Vermonters might see prioritized in the coming years. But with reduced political will in the last legislative session to proactively deal with climate change, it remains to be seen whether those plans are fiscally realistic under a governor who prioritizes short-term affordability over long-term resiliency.

“Before focusing too much on a new, shiny thing, we should really be thinking about how we maintain the current pace and level of effort,” said Julie Moore, Agency of Natural Resources secretary and a member of the Climate Council who voted for the plan. “Maintaining our current pace is far from certain in this moment.”

The state’s initial Climate Action Plan preceded devastating floods that wrecked homes and businesses along Vermont’s river valleys in 2023 and 2024. As the atmosphere warms, holding more moisture, precipitation in Vermont has become heavier and more frequent, causing deluges that can lead to deadly floods.

Climate change, largely driven by the burning of fossil fuels, has also brought increased high heat days that most homes in Vermont are ill-equipped to handle. Wildland fires have become more common and air quality has diminished in the warmer months as enormous wildfires burn elsewhere, according to the plan.

But even with the tangible effects of climate change in Vermont, state lawmakers’ attempts to significantly reduce emissions along outlines from the 2021 Climate Action Plan have failed to meet state emissions targets. Big proposals like the clean heat standard were shelved during the spring legislative session, and the state likely missed its 2025 emissions-reduction target required by the Global Warming Solutions Act. A court case currently playing out in Montpelier could help determine whether the state missed that target.

Now, as the state looks for more guidance on how to lower its emissions, the federal government could squeeze Vermont further as the Trump administration eviscerates clean energy funding and advances in climate science prioritized under President Biden. The 2025 Climate Action Plan recognized the impact of federal cuts, noting that the work to combat climate change was not about to get easier.

What’s in the plan?

The Global Warming Solutions Act binds the state to lower greenhouse gas emissions by milestones set in state statute: 26% below 2005 emissions levels by 2025, 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.

The Climate Action Plan outlines pathways to reach those goals every four years, through Climate Council planning meetings, technical analysis with consultants, and community input. More than 1,000 Vermonters and Vermont-based organizations participated in creating the plan, including 850 who joined virtual and in-person meetings and 250 who submitted public comments, according to the plan.

But even with four years of planning, Vermont is still behind its legally-binding goals. While the state initially claimed that it reached that first milestone on Jan. 1, 2025, a report by the Energy Action Network, a Vermont-based collective of energy nonprofits, instead found Vermont to have fallen up to 39% short of the emissions reduction required by law.

Moore’s agency reviewed the report and has agreed that the state was unlikely to achieve the 2025 goal, but final datasets to assess emissions won’t be available until 2027.

Previous ambitious reductions programs like the clean heat standard were shelved after a campaign by out-of-state fuel lobbyists along with Gov. Phil Scott’s rejection of the plan as unaffordable. State regulators found costs associated with the program were too high, but some members of the Climate Council disagree with those fiscal priorities.

“When we have a conversation on benefits and costs, we can’t lose sight of the cost of the status quo, which is already too high,” said Jared Duval, one of the 23 state-appointed members of the Climate Council. He quoted numbers from the state tax department that found about $2 billion a year was spent on fossil fuels for transportation and heating in 2024. An economic analysis done for the Climate Action Plan identified a potential $6 billion in costs that could be avoided by 2050 if the state pursued emissions reductions recommendations, Duval said.

With the lapse in federal funding, Duval said that in order to reduce emissions, the state would need to return to the polluter-pays principle, where fossil fuel corporations are responsible for paying for climate damages and resiliency efforts. This principle doesn’t only apply to the state’s legal battle with fossil fuel corporations in the climate superfund law, Duval said. It also stands as the rationale behind ambitious programs like the clean heat standard and the cap-and-invest model, which the climate action plan asked the state to research this year.

“The cost of those policies has always been designed to apply to importers of fossil fuels to Vermont,” Duval said. While fuel companies have said those costs will be passed onto customers, Duval said a key difference between the clean heat standard, pursued through the 2021 climate action plan, and the cap-and-invest model, again pushed forward by the 2025 plan, is that cap-and-invest can provide direct payments to Vermonters through rebates, based on their income.

Duval, along with 15 others, voted for the 2025 plan. Two councillors were not present to vote, and five voted against it, including Sarah Clark, the Agency of Administration secretary; Anson Tebbetts, the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets secretary; Michele Boomhower on behalf of Joe Flynn, the Agency of Transportation secretary; Lindsay Kurrle, Agency of Commerce and Community Development secretary; and Matt Cota, owner of Meadow Hill Consulting and representing the fuel sector. All except for Cota are in Gov. Scott’s administration and report to the governor, who has worked to overturn the legal requirements in the Global Warming Solutions Act.

Others were reluctant with their yes votes. While Moore, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources,, voted for the plan, she said that decision was mainly a reflection of her appreciation of the work of state government staff. Moore said she continues to have “some real concerns.”

“Specifically, I’m concerned about what it will take to operationalize the plan’s vision,” Moore said. “It’s sort of left up to interpretation.”

The Conservation Law Foundation, which sued the state last year claiming the Agency of Natural Resources failed to properly prepare to meet the 2025 emissions goal, called the 2025 Climate Action Plan “toothless” in a statement on Tuesday.

“The Council has worked hard to come to a consensus and deliver recommendations that include financial incentives to drive down emissions,” said Elena Mihaly, the foundation’s vice president for Vermont. “But it has failed to put in place real, enforceable policies that demand major polluters do their part too.”

The return of cap-and-invest

Much of the council’s attention this last year has been on a cap-and-invest program to reduce climate pollution. Cap-and-invest programs place a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions, according to the state, while reinvesting the proceeds to climate-friendly projects like energy efficiency and weatherization. In March, Mike Pieciak, Vermont state treasurer, spoke to the council during a special session on cap-and-invest, reminding members that of the billions the state spends on fossil fuels, “over 75% of those dollars flow out of the state.”

But a cap-and-invest model could keep more money in the state and create up to 810 jobs, according to Pieciak, especially if the state were to partner with cap-and-invest initiatives already underway such as the Western Climate Initiative, which includes California, Quebec and Washington, and the cap-and-invest program in New York state. A modified clean heat standard could complement this program, according to the 2025 Climate Action Plan, focusing on the electrification of air and water heating in low- and moderate-income households.

Such a partnership could avoid problems that Vermont encountered while pursuing a clean heat standard, the council’s previous plan to reduce thermal emissions. In a January report, the Public Utility Commission, which studied the clean heat program, told lawmakers that it would likely be too expensive for the state to take on a first-of-its-kind credit market on its own.

But this isn’t the first time cap-and-invest has been studied. Over the last four years, the Legislature asked the agency, under guidance from the 2021 Climate Action Plan, to dig into both the clean heat standard and the cap-and-invest program.

“We’re a little bit taken aback by the price tag associated with each one, along with the administrative complexity,” Moore said. “I’m hopeful that there will be an opportunity for conversation about both what we can do with existing resources.”

Moore said the cap-and-invest program could only work if Vermont joins a multi-state program, and the only one that currently exists – the Western Climate Initiative – has indicated they’re not accepting new members, she said. New York’s plan for cap-and-invest, which could be a better fit as a neighboring state, is not yet operational. Instead, Moore said, the state should focus on more actionable items like continuing to weatherize homes as federal funding disappears.

“It’s absolutely important to acknowledge long term savings associated with these practices, but you can’t gloss over the fact that there are real and significant upfront costs,” Moore said. “Figuring out how to pay for this work to generate long-term savings is fundamental, and the climate plan, I feel, doesn’t give enough treatment to that issue.”

Richard Cowart, the former chair of the Public Utility Commission and a member of the Climate Council, said the 2025 plan did a good job marrying provisions that can help communities become more resilient against the impacts of climate change alongside measures to reduce carbon emissions, while also saving the state money.

“The notion that addressing climate change has to be viewed simply as a burden is incorrect,” Cowart said, noting that instead the state’s economy could benefit from doing its part to slow the warming world. “How can we afford to continue to spend $2 billion a year to import fossil fuels that we know that we shouldn’t actually be burning?”

He pointed to Efficiency Vermont as an example of how the state has invested in efficiency, saved money, and provided environmental and health benefits. The 2025 plan builds on that experience, he said, and shows that the state doesn’t require federal money to build important programs like the first-of-its-kind utility launched a quarter century ago.

“We did not need federal money to launch Efficiency Vermont, instead we made our own decision to reduce bills for Vermonters,” Cowart said. “We can and need to do the same thing with respect to our ongoing fossil fuel bills.”

Federal funding cuts

But how the state will pay for myriad programs and strategies the 2025 plan puts forward appears to be the crux of the climate debate in Vermont, as the arguments over affordability continue.

On the federal level, the attack on climate action has never been more brutal. For months, the Trump administration has worked to gut billions of dollars in renewable energy incentives and subsidies for proven initiatives like buying electric vehicles and scaling up charging infrastructure, increasing financial access to heat pumps and solar panels, and supporting big-budget projects like green hydrogen and wind energy.

“The cost of electricity to the people you represent and the folks I represent in Vermont is going up,” said U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., directing the remark toward President Trump.

On Friday, Senate Republicans announced a new axe to clean energy: In the Trump administration’s budget overhaul called the One Big Beautiful Bill, the Senate suggested not only cutting federal funding for renewables but taxing those projects.

The proposal would have penalized solar and wind projects if they sourced materials from countries the Trump administration has a strained relationship with , including China, which dominates the world in clean energy production and materials. The North America’s Building Trades Unions called it “the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country” and equated it to “terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects.”

On Tuesday afternoon, the Senate passed the budget reconciliation bill, all but ensuring that Trump’s agenda will go into effect later this summer. But the tax was removed before Vice President J.D. Vance casted the tie-breaking vote as three GOP Senators – Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Tim Tillis of North Carolina and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine – broke with their party and voted against the bill.

The bill now moves for a vote in the House.

“In Vermont and across the country, this bill will kill jobs, raise energy prices and move us in exactly the wrong direction in the fight against climate change,” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told VTDigger in an email on Monday before the vote. “It will keep our country hooked on dirty and expensive fossil fuels by creating enormous new handouts for the very industry that is destroying the planet in pursuit of massive profits.”

Increasing frequency and severity of disasters have also taken the toll in Vermont: Since 1953, out of the 62 federally declared disasters in the state, half have occurred since 2011.

The analysis of these disasters was included in the 2025 plan, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency tool that outlined those disasters was taken down by FEMA on June 30, the day before the report was published. Days earlier, the federal climate website, climate.gov, disappeared.

The web address now redirects users to the climate webpage of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal government’s premier climate science agency currently facing severe staffing and funding cuts. The country’s sixth National Climate Assessment, which provides essential data for state and regional reports like this one, was shelved this spring when scientists were told to stop their work.

With or without federal support, Vermont will begin its third Climate Action Plan in 2028, with a new publication planned for July 1, 2029.

It recently became more difficult to understand what the regional Northeast climate will be like at that time: The fifth National Climate Assessment, which was published in 2023, is no longer available on the federal website.

While smaller, affordable EVs are thriving, high-end electric cars from established luxury brands are struggling to gain traction. Despite their advanced features and prestigious badges, these premium models face significant challenges in today’s dynamic automotive landscape. With production setbacks, dwindling sales, and shifting consumer preferences, the luxury EV segment finds itself at a crossroads. What are the underlying factors behind this trend, and how might these brands adapt to the changing tides?

The Struggles of Luxury Electric Vehicles

Recent developments in the automotive industry highlight the difficulties faced by luxury electric vehicles. Brands like Mercedes, Ferrari, and Porsche are encountering significant challenges in their EV endeavors. The highly anticipated Mercedes G-Class SUV, for instance, has seen dismal sales. Similarly, Ferrari has delayed the release of its second electric model due to weak demand. Porsche, known for its performance-oriented vehicles, has experienced soft sales of its electric Macan SUV and Taycan models. These setbacks underscore a broader trend: the struggle of high-end electric cars to capture consumer interest.

Several factors contribute to this phenomenon. First, the high price tags of luxury EVs, often exceeding $100,000, deter many potential buyers. The depreciation of these vehicles is another concern, with some models losing value at an alarming rate. Moreover, the technical demands of large premium EVs, such as their need for sizable batteries, further inflate costs. As a result, consumers increasingly opt for traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles or smaller, more affordable EVs. This shift in consumer preference highlights a critical challenge for luxury automakers: the need to balance innovation and affordability.

Changing Consumer Preferences and Market Dynamics

In the broader context, the global EV market is experiencing remarkable growth. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electric car sales worldwide continue to set new records, with projections indicating that more than 20 million EVs will be sold by 2025. This surge is largely driven by the increasing affordability of smaller EVs, particularly in emerging markets across Asia and Latin America. In stark contrast, luxury EVs face a declining interest, as consumers prioritize value and practicality over prestige.

The success of smaller EVs is exemplified by China’s dominance in the market, where nearly half of all car sales last year were electric. Chinese automakers have effectively captured market share by offering EVs priced under $25,000, making them accessible to a broader audience. This approach contrasts with the traditional flagship-first strategy of Western automakers, who often prioritize high-end models at the expense of entry-level options. As a result, legacy brands from Europe and the US find themselves at a disadvantage, struggling to compete with the accessible offerings of Chinese manufacturers.

The Impact of Global Economic and Policy Factors

Global economic and policy factors further complicate the landscape for luxury electric vehicles. The discontinuation of Audi’s Q8 E-tron, following the closure of its Belgian factory, highlights the impact of a “global decline in customer orders” in the electric luxury segment. Additionally, geopolitical elements, such as potential tariffs on imported cars from Europe, pose challenges for brands like Mercedes, which rely on the US market to offset poor European sales.

The removal of EV subsidies in the European Union has also dampened luxury EV sales. The European market share for EVs has decreased, despite the overall growth of the global EV market. These economic and policy shifts underscore the importance of adaptability for luxury automakers. To remain competitive, they must navigate a complex web of market dynamics, regulatory changes, and consumer expectations. This requires innovative strategies that balance luxury with affordability, ensuring that premium EVs can thrive in a rapidly changing environment.

The Future of Electric Luxury: Adapting to a New Era

As the luxury electric vehicle sector grapples with these challenges, the path forward requires a reevaluation of traditional strategies. Automakers must embrace a more inclusive approach, focusing on producing EVs that cater to a wider audience. This includes leveraging the advancements in EV technology to create models that offer both luxury and practicality. By doing so, brands can tap into the growing demand for affordable, high-quality electric vehicles.

In this evolving landscape, the legacy automakers must learn from the success of their Chinese counterparts. By prioritizing affordability, simplicity, and mass production, they can foster greater adoption of EVs and expand their market reach. This shift not only benefits consumers but also accelerates the development of vital charging infrastructure, much like the proliferation of gas stations during the rise of the Model T. As the auto industry continues to transform, how will these luxury brands redefine their roles in the electric age to meet the demands of a new generation of consumers?

Climate United Fund and other nonprofits in March sued the Environmental Protection Agency, its administrator Lee Zeldin and Citibank, which held the program's money. The lawsuit argued the defendants had illegally denied the groups access to billions awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a “green bank.” The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn’t already been obligated to its recipients.

The EPA said the bill should hand them a victory in their court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington. Now that Congress has rescinded funding, an earlier federal judge’s decision forcing the EPA to release money to the groups should be reversed, the agency said in its Thursday court filing.

Climate United Fund disagrees. It acknowledges that the bill in Congress is a “significant policy setback” but argues that most of the money had been disbursed and is unaffected by the bill. And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there's a different process the agency would need to follow.

“Our funds have already been obligated and disbursed. Any effort to claim otherwise is simply a lie to justify illegal attempts to claw back funds intended to benefit communities across the country,” CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated repealing the program would save just $19 million, which is in line with its administrative expenses only, indicating the bill doesn't touch the multibillion-dollar grant awards, according to Lauren Tsuboyama, spokesperson for the Power Forward Communities coalition, which received a green bank award.

According to the EPA, when the agency terminated the grants the funds “became unobligated.”

“Grantees have desperately performed legal gymnastics to hold tens of billions of taxpayer dollars hostage. In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.

The green bank’s goals run counter to the Trump administration’s opposition to policies that address climate change and its embrace of fossil fuels. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the $20 billion in grants as a scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.

In February, Zeldin told Fox News that he suspected the green bank “was a clear cut case of waste and abuse” that “in my opinion, is criminal.” The following month, Zeldin terminated the grants.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has previously said that when the federal government was asked for evidence of fraud, the agency didn’t provide it and shifted its position. Chutkan decided the government can’t terminate the contracts and that the groups should have access to some of their frozen money.

That order was put on hold during the EPA’s appeal.

The agency argues the nonprofits are making constitutional and statutory arguments that don’t apply in what it sees as a simple contract fight.

If the government successfully argues the case is a contract dispute, then the EPA says it should be heard by a different court that can only award a lump sum – not force the government to keep the grants in place. Federal officials argue there is no law or provision in the Constitution that compels the EPA to make these grants to these groups.

In its court filing, the EPA also pointed to comments by Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as supportive of the agency's position. Capito said previously the bill intended to rescind billions in funding that had been frozen.

“This action reflects not only Congress's deep concern with reducing the deficit, but EPA's administration of the (green bank) under the Biden administration, the agency's selection of grant recipients, and the absence of meaningful program oversight,"" the agency quotes the senator as saying.

However, cold weather remains a significant hurdle for electric vehicle (EV) performance, particularly in terms of battery charging speed. A recent breakthrough could revolutionize the way lithium-ion batteries function in frigid temperatures. This innovation promises to reduce charging times by up to five times during cold spells. By adapting both the structural design and chemical reactions within the battery, researchers have paved the way for enhanced EV performance in winter, potentially transforming the EV landscape in colder regions.

Revolutionary Advancements in Battery Technology

The cornerstone of this breakthrough lies in the innovative modifications made to lithium-ion batteries. Scientists have succeeded in significantly improving the charging speed of these batteries at temperatures as low as 14°F. The research, published in the journal Joule, highlights a dual approach: altering the battery’s structure and adjusting the chemical reactions that occur during charging. These modifications work in synergy to combat the thickening of the electrolyte liquid caused by cold weather, which typically slows down the movement of lithium ions and extends charging times.

The adverse effects of cold temperatures on battery performance are well-documented. As the electrolyte thickens, the electric current is reduced, leading to longer charging durations. Traditional solutions, such as thickening the electrodes, have often exacerbated the issue by further limiting fast charging capabilities. However, the new technique offers a promising alternative that effectively addresses these limitations.

Structural Modifications with Laser Precision

A key component of this innovation involves creating pathways in the anode of the battery. Researchers achieved this by using lasers to drill holes into the graphite layers of the anode. This technique, initially tested in 2020, facilitates faster movement of lithium ions, significantly enhancing charging speed. However, in cold conditions, this approach previously led to unwanted lithium deposition.

To counteract this issue, scientists applied a thin layer of lithium borate-carbonate to the battery. This material, renowned for its ability to improve the efficiency of solid-state batteries, has proven instrumental in increasing charging efficiency by an impressive 500% in cold weather. These structural modifications not only accelerate ion flow but also prevent detrimental side reactions, ensuring the battery performs optimally even in icy conditions.

Unprecedented Performance in Cold Climates

The modified batteries have exhibited remarkable durability, retaining 97% of their capacity after undergoing 100 cycles of rapid charging in freezing temperatures. This resilience underscores the potential of these innovations to be seamlessly integrated into existing battery manufacturing processes. As noted by Neil Dasgupta, these advancements do not necessitate major overhauls in production, making them highly feasible for widespread adoption.

This breakthrough is poised to enhance the performance of EVs during winter months, which is a significant selling point for consumers in regions with harsh winters. By mitigating the effects of cold weather on battery efficiency, these innovations could encourage more consumers to switch to electric vehicles, thereby contributing to global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

The Broader Implications for Electric Vehicles

Cold temperatures are notorious for impacting the energy efficiency of electric vehicles. As the electrolyte liquid thickens, the movement of lithium ions between electrodes is hindered, leading to a reduction in electric current and increased charging times. This phenomenon also affects the energy efficiency of the vehicle, as chemical reactions become less effective in cold weather, resulting in reduced driving range.

Manufacturers have explored various strategies to address these challenges, such as increasing electrode thickness, but these have often led to further complications with fast charging. The recent study provides a more effective approach to overcoming these obstacles, offering a pathway to improved battery performance without compromising on charging speed or capacity.

The advent of these advanced battery technologies represents a significant leap forward for electric vehicles, particularly in winter conditions. By addressing the fundamental challenges posed by cold weather, these innovations have the potential to transform the EV market and accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation. As we look to the future, how will these advancements shape the global adoption of electric vehicles, and what further innovations might emerge to support this transition?

As motorists have turned their backs on Tesla, other automakers appear to have quietly taken advantage of remaining interest among consumers.

General Motors, for example, reported this week that it sold 78,167 EVs in 2025 so far — more than a 100% increase compared to the same period last year. More than half of those were sold in the second quarter.

The automaker claimed its Chevrolet division was the bestselling EV brand nationwide during the second quarter.

This comes one month after GM said the company as a whole was considered to be the #2 seller of EVs in the U.S.

“Customers are responding in record numbers to our world-class portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles,” Rory Harvey, executive VP and president of global markets, said in June.

“In the first two months of the second quarter, we more than doubled our EV sales compared to the same period last year,” Harvey added.

Analysts have said that GM’s success is in part due to declining levels of trust among consumers when it comes to Tesla, as many believed Musk soured on the brand’s name during his close engagement with President Donald Trump during the first 100 days of his administration.

Musk worked closely with the White House during the first 100 days of Trump’s administration, spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to slash the size of the federal government and federal spending.

Musk’s alliance with the administration sparked protests against Tesla worldwide, with some dealerships and Tesla drivers even facing vandalism and violent attacks in some cases.

In March, demonstrators held a “Tesla Takedown Global Day of Action” with more than 200 protests scheduled at Tesla-affiliated locations across the country.

More recently, Musk and Trump engaged in a public feud on social media over Republican lawmakers’ mega tax and policy spending legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The bill, passed by Congress on Thursday afternoon, moved to cut several green initiatives and tax credits that have benefited Musk and his businesses like Tesla.

HOW TRUMP’S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ WOULD AFFECT MUSK AND TESLA

Some analysts have also noted that Tesla’s drop in sales is driven by the phasing out of these federal tax credits, including the Clean Vehicle Credit, now set to end in September. This credit currently offers consumers a $7,500 credit for purchasing plug-in vehicles.

As Tesla recovers from Musk’s drama with the White House, analysts have indicated that stability and a greater variety from other companies like GM has a big appeal for EV consumers.

YU7’s Explosive Demand Outpaces Production

Xiaomi’s YU7, a sleek SUV competing in the executive E-Segment, has captured China’s attention, with 240,000 non-refundable orders placed within 18 hours of its debut. However, production bottlenecks are a significant hurdle. The standard YU7 faces wait times of up to 15 months, while the Max variant averages 9.5 months, as reported by Yicai Global. To address this, Xiaomi completed its Auto Phase II factory in June and is aggressively recruiting to boost output, according to Sina Technology. CEO Lei Jun reportedly acknowledged the delays, advising urgent buyers to consider alternatives like the Tesla Model Y or Xpeng G7.

The YU7’s specs highlight its appeal:

Range: Up to 497 miles (800 km) on a single charge (CLTC standard).

Power: Dual-motor Max variant delivers 664 hp.

Price: Starting at approximately $41,500 (299,900 CNY).

Quality Control and Global Hurdles

Despite its popularity, Xiaomi faces quality concerns. Its SU7 sedan ranked last in the 2025 Q1 China automobile quality survey for large battery-electric sedans, per CarNewsChina. Lei Jun emphasized a quality-first approach for the YU7, stating, “Knowing Xiaomi’s cars would be scrutinized by millions of netizens, that every flaw would be magnified 10-thousand-fold, we prioritized quality above all from day one,” as quoted by Yicai Global. Improving quality control is critical to building consumer trust before tackling global markets.

International expansion by 2027 presents steep challenges. Xiaomi must navigate diverse regulatory standards, establish robust sales and service networks, and scale production to meet global demand. While the company’s digital ecosystem—integrating EVs with smart platforms—sets it apart, success hinges on resolving domestic issues first.

Xiaomi’s Threat to Tesla’s Dominance

Tesla’s struggles in China, where BYD holds the largest EV market share, create an opening for Xiaomi. The YU7’s competitive pricing and impressive range position it as a strong rival to the Model Y, China’s best-selling EV in 2024. Xiaomi’s ability to leverage its tech expertise could redefine EVs as connected platforms, appealing to tech-savvy drivers. However, with production delays and quality concerns, Xiaomi’s global ambitions remain a high-stakes endeavor.

The legislation eliminates a wide array of clean energy tax credits, including those supporting commercial electric vehicles, alternative fuels, EV charging infrastructure, and energy-efficient building upgrades.

Port officials said the move undercuts the agency’s ability to meet its climate goals.

“The passage of this bill makes the local fight against climate change harder, not easier,” said Port of Seattle Commission President Toshiko Hasegawa. “These credits help us decarbonize our fleet and accelerate green infrastructure investments. While this setback is deeply disappointing, we remain steadfast in our commitments.”

The bill also rescinds Environmental Protection Agency funding created under the Inflation Reduction Act, including grants the Port uses to support the transition of heavy-duty diesel trucks to electric or low-emission alternatives.

“By removing incentives for electrification and clean fuels for trucks, ships, and planes, the big bill is beyond bad for the Port’s and the nation’s ability to combat climate change and create jobs of the future,” said Commissioner Fred Felleman.

Despite its criticisms, the Port acknowledged some positive elements of the legislation, including investments in air traffic control, airport security, and Coast Guard operations that benefit Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and maritime infrastructure.

The recent uproar over Michigan’s high electricity rates deserves real scrutiny, but not just of DTE or Consumers Energy. What’s driving our bills through the roof isn’t executive pay or lobbying. It’s a radical, top-down energy agenda being pushed by Lansing politicians and rubber-stamped by bureaucrats.

In 2023, Governor Whitmer signed legislation forcing Michigan’s utilities to provide 100% “clean” energy by 2040. This includes a 50% mandate by 2030 and 60% by 2035. These are some of the most aggressive mandates in the country. They require utilities to abandon reliable, affordable fossil fuels, especially natural gas, and pour billions into wind, solar, batteries, and costly grid upgrades. And guess who’s footing the bill? We are.

green energy transition sounds noble until you see the price tag, and consider the fact that they are actually not cleaner than fossil fuels. DTE recently requested a $574 million rate increase. Consumers Energy followed with an even bigger one; $436 million annually, the largest in company history. Why? Because these companies are now forced to rip out dependable gas plants and replace them with expensive, intermittent and inefficient solar panels and wind turbines. The state can pretend this is about “saving the planet,” but the truth is clear: our energy bills are skyrocketing because of mandates we don’t need.

Let’s be honest, natural gas is not the problem. It’s one of the cleanest, safest, and most abundant energy sources in America. It produces a fraction of the emissions coal once did, and it’s been the main reason the U.S. has reduced carbon emissions over the last decade. Natural gas provides dependable baseload power during harsh Michigan winters and severe storms, when solar and wind can’t deliver. It’s also cheap, at least it was, before politicians started regulating it out of existence.

Instead of embracing this reliable resource, our state is doubling down on unreliable “renewables” that require government subsidies to survive. The wind doesn’t always blow, and the sun doesn’t always shine, the solar panels lose efficiency and the wind turbines burn up and pollute. But the bills? They keep coming, higher than ever. As a side note, solar panels also need to be cleaned regularly and in Michigan, snow removed.

If you’re frustrated with high rates, don’t just blame the utility companies and CEOs. Look at the politicians who passed laws forcing these changes and the regulators approving every penny of these rate hikes in the name of climate ideology. It’s not about modernizing the grid or protecting the environment. It’s about pushing a political agenda, no matter how much it costs working families.

Enough is enough. We don’t need 100% “clean energy” by 2040. What we need is affordable, reliable energy now, and that means standing up for natural gas and pushing back against extreme mandates that do nothing but raise our cost of living.

In the end, President Donald Trump’s giant tax and spending plan rocketed past both fiscal hawks and social moderates in the House with no changes on Thursday.

The $4 trillion One Big Beautiful Bill Act is now ready to reach across the U.S. economy, slicing into every aspect of the national effort to address climate change and environmental injustice.

The 887-page legislation largely erases the landmark investment in cleaner energy, jobs and communities that a Democratic-led Congress made only three years ago in the Inflation Reduction Act.

It stomps out incentives for purchasing electric vehicles and efficient appliances. It phases out tax credits for wind and solar energy. It opens up federal land and water for oil and gas drilling and increases its profitability, while creating new federal support for coal. It ends the historic investment in poor and minority communities that bear a disproportionate pollution burden—money that the Trump administration was already refusing to spend. It wipes out any spending on greening the federal government.

President Joe Biden’s team left office expressing confidence that his climate legacy was secure because most of the $132 billion in private investment in clean energy manufacturing spurred by his programs was going to Republican districts and states.

But Republican members of Congress who spoke out in favor of clean energy—enough members to make a decisive voting bloc in both House and Senate—refused to hold up Trump’s larger agenda for the cause. The strategy of insisting on “one big” bill, coupled with political threats against would-be foes (two of whom announced in the past week they would not seek re-election), turned out to be a winning one for the president.

During the hottest days of the hot spell the ISO was noticing a decline in operating reserves. On June 29, the grid operated normally but emergency operations were a possibility to maintain system reliability. The morning of June 30, the ISO noted potential afternoon strains on the grid on a cooler Wednesday. “Special Case Resources and Emergency Demand Response Program resources are needed,” the notice indicated, between 2 and 9 p.m. in zones of the state that included Western New York. When that notice was sent dual fuels, natural gas and nuclear were 83% of the energy being generated. Hydropower was at 15% while solar was around 3% and wind was at 0.29%.

We’re not sure Gov. Kathy Hochul could have timed her directive to the New York Power Authority to build a new nuclear plant somewhere in Upstate New York any better. After years of dumping dollar after dollar after dollar into wind and solar power, they produced a whopping 3.29% of the state’s electricity. It was renewable energy’s time to shine – and it fizzled.

Years of the Independent System Operator’s warnings about looming power shortages took on new urgency a couple of weeks ago. New York always knew it couldn’t pin all of its renewable energy hope on wind and solar power. Reliable sources of power that aren’t dependent on weather have been part of every zero emission power grid model since the state passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in 2019. But in 2019 the reliable power source didn’t exist yet. There was hope it would be battery storage, but as the CLCPA’s deadlines loom that technology isn’t ready for prime time. Environmentalists have deemed natural gas not clean enough to continue using. So, we find ourselves going back to the future with nuclear power plants.

Hochul’s decision to pursue nuclear power to meet the state’s power needs calls into question the millions of dollars the state and federal government have thrown at solar and wind power over the past couple of decades only to find that nuclear power or keeping natural gas in use to generate electricity are the best options to make sure the lights come on when you flip a switch, that your car charges when you plug it in at night and your refrigerator continues running during a heat wave.

The state must take the best options to guarantee consistent, reliable power throughout the state.

Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft are just a few tech giants making use of carbon credits

Tech titans have a well-deserved reputation for moving fast and breaking things. But in the credibility-battered sustainability segment of carbon credits, Big Tech giants including Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are the ones doing the fixing. And they're taking time to do it right - at a high level only they can.

The market for carbon credits, the instruments that companies typically buy to support carbon-dioxide reduction, or CDR, cratered after a series of reports bashed their ineffectiveness. Even so, survey after survey reveals demand is as strong as ever - but only for verifiable, high-impact CDR initiatives like what Big Tech is spinning up.

If successful, these massive regional efforts could play a crucial role in capping rising global temperatures at around 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, something scientists say will be necessary to sidestep the most devastating effects of climate change.

That's compelling for many enterprises - even in the U.S., in the face of hurricane-force political headwinds. Executives say the dollars-and-sense rationale of sustainability is too compelling to ignore. Investors demand it. Consumers prefer it. Some of today's brightest minds insist on it.

If there's a downside to the wave of Big Tech-supported projects, it's that while they're big enough to make a difference, their projects may be too stratospheric for down-to-earth-sized companies. But even that may be starting to change.

The CDR imperative

To keep rising temperatures in check, two broad directives came out of the 2016 Paris climate accord. One was the ""net zero"" mandate, which called for the globe to neutralize greenhouse-gas emissions from energy, transportation and industrial sectors by 2050. The other was to help the planet remove a lot more carbon than it's now capable of doing.

How much more? Depending on how the next 25 years unfold, we'll have to find ways to extract at least 100 billion metric tons more CO2 from the atmosphere - and perhaps as much as 1 trillion tons - by the end of the century.

All of which raises the question: Who is going to pay for all of this?

The voluntary carbon market, or VCM, stepped in with a mechanism to help companies fund carbon reduction. That put the market on a spectacular growth trajectory, quadrupling to about $2.1 billion in 2021.

Two years later, though, the market withered to $723 million, barely a third of its peak. The dramatic reversal was sparked by a series of critical reports that exposed a wide array of questionable accounting practices, including:

-- Double- and triple-counting documented emissions reductions.

-- Charging to preserve parcels in no danger of deforestation.

-- Claiming to halt deforestation for land-clearing projects that developers relocated.

Carbon credit 2.0

Sales may have shriveled, but demand never did. Buyers now insist on higher-quality credits with built-in evidence of impact. Oversight is improving. Next-gen accreditations are buttoning up.

Carbon-removal efforts largely fall into two broad camps: nature-based initiatives, like working to halt deforestation and reforesting already cleared lands; and innovative technology-centric projects like direct air capture, or DAC, which extracts CO2 from the atmosphere, and ocean alkalinity enhancement, or OAE, which helps salt water absorb more carbon. Credits to fund technology-based projects are just starting to ramp.

Nature-based and technology-based initiatives each have advantages and disadvantages. But due to the magnitude of the problem, Earth will need myriad ways to capture and store emissions. Which is why most Big Tech companies spread their investments across a mix of approaches.

In the nature-based arena, Big Tech is unquestionably going big. In May, Microsoft partnered with a carbon-credit management firm to buy 18 million tons of high-quality, long-term nature-based credits. Last year, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce (CRM) launched a coalition of big buyers to support nature-based CDR.

Amazon sets the pace

Nowhere is that more evident than with what Amazon.com is helping to craft in the Amazon - nature's grandest rainforest. There, the pioneer of online shopping and cloud computing is playing a pivotal role in regional-scale projects that extend across nearly a quarter of the Amazon rainforest, combined.

The massive project is a jurisdictional effort, an emerging class of regional initiatives that enlists governments to address the root cause of deforestation at a scale large enough to offer long-term benefits to local communities as well as the climate.

A major part of the funding is coming from the LEAF Coalition, which has raised more than $1 billion to sponsor projects like Amazon's. LEAF was co-founded by Amazon along with governments like Norway, the U.K. and large enterprises like Salesforce and Nestle (CH:NESN).

Perhaps most intriguing for smaller companies pining for difference-making credits, Amazon recently announced it will offer credits from a selection of initiatives, including jurisdictional projects in the Amazon, and technology-based efforts via a new service. The first credits from the service will be available later this year, Amazon says. To buy credits, companies must first meet eligibility criteria that demonstrates their decarbonization commitment.

Democratization coming?

It's too early to say whether Amazon's credits are a harbinger of broader availability for A-List credits. In the meantime, some companies - like Ryan Companies , a top-50 domestic general contractor - are happy to see the new service come available.

Joe Rozza, Ryan's chief sustainability officer, says that up to now, the company has been focused on decarbonizing operations. But Ryan is now ready to invest in carbon credits - and Amazon's service caught its attention.

""I'm really excited about the potential for scale and the impact that could come from this,"" Rozza said. ""It's an exciting development for a lot of us, I think. This concept of democratizing access to high-quality carbon credits that are having an impact on climate change right now, it gives us an opportunity in some small way to have a much more immediate effect.""

He said their standard line is to say Republican legislation is dangerous or everybody's going to die and we can't let them get away with it.
With his bill, Trump said, it's actually just the opposite, everybody's going to live.
Speaking in Iowa on Thursday night, Trump said Democrats hate Trump – but I hate them, too.
Upon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as very popular, though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed his package of tax breaks and spending cuts into law Friday in front of Fourth of July picnickers after his cajoling produced almost unanimous Republican support in Congress for the domestic priority that could cement his second-term legacy.

Flanked by Republican legislators and members of his Cabinet, Trump signed the multitrillion-dollar legislation at a desk on the White House driveway, then banged down a gavel gifted to him by House Speaker Mike Johnson that was used during the bill's final passage Thursday.

Against odds that at times seemed improbable, Trump achieved his goal of celebrating a historic – and divisive – legislative victory in time for the nation's birthday, which also was his self-imposed deadline for Congress to send the legislation to his desk. Fighter jets and stealth bombers streaked through the sky over the annual White House Fourth of July picnic.

America's winning, winning, winning like never before, Trump said, noting last month's bombing campaign against Iran's nuclear program, which he said the flyover was meant to honor. Promises made, promises kept, and we've kept them.

The White House was hung with red, white, and blue bunting for the Independence Day festivities. The US Marine Band played patriotic marches – and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. There were three separate flyovers.

Trump spoke for a relatively brief 22 minutes before signing the bill, but was clearly energized as the legislation's passage topped a recent winning streak for his administration. That included the Iran campaign and a series of US Supreme Court rulings he's fought for.

After dark, chants of USA, USA rose from the picnic crowd on the South Lawn when Trump and the first lady, Melania, appeared on the Truman Balcony to watch the fireworks. They danced to Y.M.C.A. and waved goodbye to the crowd before they left for their home in New Jersey.

The budget legislation is the president's highest-profile win yet. It includes key campaign pledges like no tax on tips or Social Security income. Trump, who spent an unusual amount of time thanking individual Republican lawmakers who shepherded the measure through Congress, contended our country is going to be a rocket ship, economically, because of the legislation.

Big cuts to Medicaid and food stamps

Critics assailed the package as a giveaway to the rich that will rob millions more lower income people of their health insurance, food assistance, and financial stability.

Today, Donald Trump signed into law the worst job-killing bill in American history. It will rip health care from 17 million workers to pay for massive tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations, amounting to the country's largest money grab from the working class to the ultra-rich, AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement. Every member of Congress who voted for this devastating bill picked the pockets of working people to hand billionaires a $5-trillion gift.

The legislation extends Trump's 2017 multitrillion-dollar tax cuts and cuts Medicaid and food stamps by $1.2 trillion. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement. Congress' non-partisan scorekeeper projects that nearly 12 million more people will lose health insurance under the law.

The legislation passed the House on a largely party-line vote Thursday, culminating a months-long push by the GOP to cram most of its legislative priorities into a single budget bill that could be enacted without Senate Democrats being able to block it indefinitely by filibustering.

It passed by a single vote in the Senate, where North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis announced he would not run for reelection after incurring Trump's wrath in opposing it. Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote.

In the House, where two Republicans voted against it, one, conservative maverick Tom Massie of Kentucky, has also become a target of Trump's well-funded political operation. No Democrats voted for the bill.

The legislation amounts to a repudiation of the agendas of the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, in rolling back Obama's Medicaid expansion under his signature health law and Biden's tax credits for renewable energy.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin on Friday called the bill devastating and said in a statement that Trump's signature on the legislation sealed the fate of the Republican Party, cementing them as the party for billionaires and special interests – not working families.

He predicted Republicans would lose their majority in Congress over it. This was a full betrayal of the American people, Martin said.

Trump complained Friday about Democrats opposing the bill, and we knew that because their hatred of either the country or me or both is so great they didn't vote at all and it's terrible.

He said their standard line is to say Republican legislation is dangerous or everybody's going to die and we can't let them get away with it. With his bill, Trump said, it's actually just the opposite, everybody's going to live.

And I just want you to know, if you see anything negative put out by Democrats, it's all a con job, Trump said, defending a package that now is law.

Speaking in Iowa on Thursday night, Trump said Democrats hate Trump – but I hate them, too.

The package is certain to be a flashpoint in next year's mid-term elections, and Democrats are making ambitious plans for rallies, voter registration drives, attack ads, bus tours, and even a multi-day vigil, all intended to highlight the most controversial elements.

Upon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as very popular, though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best.

For example, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that majorities of US adults support increasing the annual child tax credit and eliminating taxes on earnings from tips, and about half support work requirements for some adults who receive Medicaid.

But the poll found majorities oppose reducing federal funding for food assistance to low-income families and spending about $45 billion to build and maintain migrant detention centers. About 60 percent said it was unacceptable that the bill is expected to increase the $36 trillion US debt by more than $3 trillion over the next decade.",https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/images/2025/07/05/24452.webp,N,,2025-07-05 18:06:38.107845

Or maybe she was one of the hundreds of researchers studying pollution, clean water and climate change who had just been fired by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Scientists in the United States tend to avoid activism; many fear that wading into politics will undermine their work and compromise their independence.
Others worry that engaging in protest or political statements will distort the value of their research and further erode Americans’ already diminishing trust in science.","This past April, I attended one of the nation’s 1,400 “Hands Off” protests, participating in what was, at the time, the largest demonstration against Donald Trump’s second term. (The recent “No Kings” demonstrations were even larger.) Thousands of people lined the sidewalks along 22nd Street in Tucson, most wearing white and holding handwritten signs, some of them funny and others not. One sign caught my eye for its matter-of-fact clarity: the simple statement “Science is not an alternative fact.” The young woman holding it must be a scientist, I thought, looking into her face.

I wondered if she was one of the many employees — more than 10% of the agency’s staff — who were recently fired from the National Institutes of Health. Perhaps she was among the 800 staffers cut from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the 170 laid off by the National Science Foundation — half of whom were reinstated after a judge ruled that firing probationary workers was illegal. Or maybe she was one of the hundreds of researchers studying pollution, clean water and climate change who had just been fired by the Environmental Protection Agency. Then again, she could have worked at our local University of Arizona, one of many researchers whose grants were rescinded by a federal agency.

“Science is not an alternative fact.”

Or she could have been like me: Not directly affected by the cuts, but with plenty of collective and moral reasons to protest. There are so many of us whose mission is not just to understand but to make others understand and care about the life-and-death consequences of climate change. The science behind it all matters; the impacts affect everyone.

Scientists in the United States tend to avoid activism; many fear that wading into politics will undermine their work and compromise their independence. Others worry that engaging in protest or political statements will distort the value of their research and further erode Americans’ already diminishing trust in science.

And yet scientist-activists have long helped shape public opinion and address seemingly intractable societal problems — the fight against nuclear proliferation, for example, or the pushback against genetically modified foods. Remember the 1960s and ’70s? Books like Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring and research by U.S. scientists revealed the health impacts of air and water pollution, leading to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of landmark environmental legislation. Fast-forward to the recent past — the aftermath of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests — and, of course, to today, with the ongoing climate crisis, when scientists are mobilizing and needed more than ever.

A recent piece in the journal Nature argued that this shift has been at least 15 years in the making: “Calls for activism through or in climate science have multiplied, urging scholars to engage in activism as an ethical and social duty beyond traditional roles of writing journal articles or managing research.” Acts of civil disobedience can help spark real action on climate change, while scientists can also help by serving as expert witnesses or producing scientific reports for national or regional governments and civil society sectors. “Scientists can be rigorous, objective, and engaged, all at the same time,” said the authors. “This does not necessarily imply neutrality.”

Back in 2016, during Trump’s first term, the Pew Research Center found that 56% of the general public supported a major role for climate scientists in policy decisions. As if on cue, scientists mobilized as they had not done since Vietnam. According to sociology professors Scott Frickel and Fernando Tormos-Aponte, this inspired the creation of more science advocacy organizations and a greater push for fossil fuel divestment at some universities, including the University of California system.

“Scientists can be rigorous, objective, and engaged, all at the same time.”

Frickel and Tormos-Aponte’s survey of scientists confirmed that the current cultural shift may have started with the first Trump presidency but was truly galvanized into action by the urgent need for climate justice. When the scientists were asked how often they thought they should be politically active, 95% answered “sometimes,” “most of the time” or even “always,” especially younger scientists and those who are active on social media.

A couple of weeks after the Hands Off protest, news of the dismissal of almost 400 contributors to the Sixth National Climate Assessment (NCA) mandated by Congress clearly showed that the second Trump administration’s policies are not just anti-science but outright vengeful and destructive. Not to mention irrational: The firings leave states across the West — from Washington to Nevada and Arizona — without the ability to prepare for climate impacts such as extreme heat, wildfires and drought.

In a social media post, Arizona State University scientist Dave White, a lead author of the 2023 Fifth National Climate Assessment, said he and his colleagues remain committed to scientific integrity. “We must continue to push forward,” White wrote. “The stakes are too high.”

Soon after White’s post, a group of activist scientists came forward and pledged to continue NCA’s work: The American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union will now produce more than 29 peer-reviewed journals that cover all aspects of the climate crisis in this fast-changing political climate.",https://media.coloradotimesrecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-05-at-11.51.54-AM-1000x500.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 15:08:33.701082

Data centers consume huge amounts of electricity, and are creating unprecedented demand in electricity markets.

In Illinois, data centers already take up more than 5% of the state’s total electricity consumption.
Chicagoland will likely be on the frontline of struggles around AI data centers in the years to come.","In Chicago, the electrical utility company ComEd announced that households would be paying more than $10 more on average for electricity per month this summer, a rise of 10%. In downstate Illinois, serviced by utility company Ameren, prices are rising even more. Households there can expect their electric bills to rise by roughly 20%, which for the average residential customer is around $40 a month.

This dramatic rise in the price of electricity is primarily caused by the rapid growth of AI data centers in the region. Chicagoland is one of the top markets for data centers in the country. Data centers consume huge amounts of electricity, and are creating unprecedented demand in electricity markets. These data centers are generating massive profits for some, but leave workers with more bills and devastate the environment.

‘Deregulated’ energy

Electricity rates in Illinois, like much of the United States, are not rationally set according to the needs of people or industry. Instead, the country is broken up into multiple electrical power markets. In some markets, prices are determined by auctions where utility companies, like ComEd and Ameren, bid to buy power from electricity generators — corporations like Constellation and Vistra. The cost set at these auctions determines what households eventually pay. This system has its origins in neoliberal reforms introduced in the 1990s, and was sold as a way to harness the free market to decrease prices. In reality, it has enabled energy companies to make massive profits.

Last year, an auction on these markets saw a massive increase in the price of electricity, with prices jumping 830%. On the day of the auction, the stock of Constellation rose 11% and the Vistra stock price jumped 14.5%.

The regional transmission organization that oversees the energy market that includes Chicago and much of the eastern United States is PJM Interconnection. The independent monitor of PJM attributed the spike in electricity prices to new data centers, stating that “data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions, including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices.” The report says that data center energy use by itself added $9.3 billion in costs to the record breaking energy auction of 2024. These costs are causing the increased bills for regular households.

Governor JB Pritzker, a champion of data center construction, pushed back on PJM for allowing these massive price increases to occur at auctions. Last month, the New York Times highlighted discontent with PJM from several state governors. The decentralized, profit-driven U.S. energy system never delivered on its promise of lower prices for consumers, and now it seems unable to cope with the rapid growth of AI data centers.

AI fuels more energy use

The growth in data centers is a nationwide phenomenon. Liberation News has previously reported on how the rapid development and deployment of AI, in the form of large language models, is currently a key priority of the U.S. capitalist class. For U.S. capitalists, AI is seen as a way to reassert their global power and cut back on labor costs, but for working people, it means potential job losses and environmental destruction.

The AI industry requires large amounts of physical infrastructure to run its models. While services like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama may be accessible on an individual’s phone or computer, they are actually being run on specialized hardware in dedicated data centers. The massive rollout of AI, alongside crypto and cloud data, has fueled a doubling in the number of data centers from 2021 to 2024. In Illinois, data centers already take up more than 5% of the state’s total electricity consumption. This number will keep rising as new data centers are constructed.

The increased need for electricity is leading to the delay of closures for electrical plants which rely on fossil fuels, which will make hitting emission targets to mitigate climate change even harder. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has even advocated for abandoning climate emission goals in order to power more AI data centers, because he claims AI will solve the climate crisis.

Giant tech companies who run data centers seem to be cutting out the middleman of the energy markets entirely and signing deals directly with generators, with the deals often involving nuclear power plants. Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, site of an infamous nuclear disaster in 1979, is being brought back online after Constellation Energy signed a deal with Microsoft to power their data centers. In Illinois, Meta has signed a similar agreement with Constellation Energy to keep the nuclear power plant in Clinton in operation.

Chicagoland

Chicagoland is one of the biggest data center markets in the United States for multiple reasons. Lake Michigan can provide water to data centers close to Chicago, and the area is at the center of U.S. transportation and communication infrastructure. As noted above, technology firms are increasingly looking towards nuclear power to power their data centers. Illinois has the highest percentage of nuclear generated energy of any state in the United States, with more than half the state’s power coming from nuclear plants. Finally, Illinois political leaders have courted data center construction, passing tax breaks for their construction in 2019. Chicagoland will likely be on the frontline of struggles around AI data centers in the years to come.

The rising cost of electricity in Illinois and around the country is because capitalists and government officials are prioritizing the implementation of AI and the rapid building of data centers over the needs of working people. The rise in electricity prices is not the result of some natural phenomenon, but because of decades of policies meant to protect profits and reaffirm free-market beliefs.

The potential benefits of AI do not have to come at the cost of the average person’s standard of living and the environment. A socialist system could distribute electricity in a centralized and planned manner without the need for profit. Instead of a competition to quickly construct data centers, facilities could be constructed in a sustainable manner that protecte surrounding communities and the environment.",https://liberationnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Clinton-Power-Plant-700x350-cropped.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 15:08:25.947375

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) issued a joint statement condemning the Trump administration’s push to approve the project while rushing through environmental impact reviews.
“The Bureau of Land Management’s decision to fast-track the Wildcat Loadout expansion — a project that would transport an additional 70,000 barrels of crude oil on train tracks along the Colorado River — using emergency procedures is profoundly flawed,” the Colorado Democrats said.

“Any derailment and oil spill would have a devastating impact on the Colorado River and the communities and ecosystems that rely upon it.”","The Trump administration has quietly fast-tracked a massive oil expansion project that environmentalists and Democratic lawmakers warned could have a destructive impact on local communities and the climate.

As reported recently by the Oil and Gas Journal, the plan “involves expanding the Wildcat Loadout Facility, a key transfer point for moving Uinta basin crude oil to rail lines that transport it to refineries along the Gulf Coast.”

The goal of the plan is to transfer an additional 70,000 barrels of oil per day from the Wildcat Loadout Facility, which is located in Utah, down to the Gulf Coast refineries via a route that runs along the Colorado River. Controversially, the Trump administration is also plowing ahead with the project by invoking emergency powers to address energy shortages despite the fact that the United States for the last couple of years has been producing record levels of domestic oil.

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) issued a joint statement condemning the Trump administration’s push to approve the project while rushing through environmental impact reviews.

“The Bureau of Land Management’s decision to fast-track the Wildcat Loadout expansion — a project that would transport an additional 70,000 barrels of crude oil on train tracks along the Colorado River — using emergency procedures is profoundly flawed,” the Colorado Democrats said. “These procedures give the agency just 14 days to complete an environmental review — with no opportunity for public input or administrative appeal — despite the project’s clear risks to Colorado. There is no credible energy emergency to justify bypassing public involvement and environmental safeguards. The United States is currently producing more oil and gas than any country in the world.”

On Thursday, the Bureau of Land Management announced the completion of its accelerated environmental review of the project, drawing condemnation from climate advocates.

Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, described the administration’s rush to approve the project as “pure hubris,” especially given its “refusal to hear community concerns about oil spill risks.” She added that “this fast-tracked review breezed past vital protections for clean air, public safety and endangered species.”

Landon Newell, staff attorney for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, accused the Trump administration of manufacturing an energy emergency to justify plans that could have a dire impact on local habitats.

“This thinly analyzed decision threatens the lifeblood of the American Southwest by authorizing the transport of more than 1 billion gallons annually of additional oil on railcars traveling alongside the Colorado River,” he said. “Any derailment and oil spill would have a devastating impact on the Colorado River and the communities and ecosystems that rely upon it.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2207325344-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 18:05:47.688162

Back in 2023, CBS Colorado learned more about the 775,000-square-foot Amprius Technologies facility planned to open at 18875 E. Bromley Land in Brighton. State leaders said the facility would boost Colorado's clean energy economy, but neighbors felt differently.

Those same neighbors are rejoicing over the fact that the battery factory will not be becoming operational near their homes anytime soon.

Jessie Williams has spent years fighting against the lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility, which was planned to be located just 650 feet from her home.

""I have made sure to watch all their moves, between all their mergers with their manufacturers, and also to see what movement was going to actually happen with the building,"" Williams said. ""Definitely keeping track on everything.""

Earlier in 2025, the company officially put the Colorado plant on hold.

Amprius CEO Kang Sun shared a statement with CBS Colorado that said, ""At this time, there are no immediate plans to move forward with the next phase of the Colorado facility. We have completed the design phase and continue to closely monitor market dynamics. Building a domestic supply chain for next-generation batteries is important, but also uniquely challenging. Manufacturing these cutting-edge battery technologies at scale in the U.S. requires a highly capital-intensive process. Beyond cost, it also demands deep technical expertise, capabilities that are still developing in the U.S. Meanwhile, other countries have spent years building mature, cost-efficient battery industries, giving them a significant head start. At Amprius, we are able to meet our production needs through a global contract manufacturing network that enables us to scale quickly without building new infrastructure. Our cells are commercially available, allowing us to meet customers' demand worldwide. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, we shipped batteries to more than 100 customers. Our silicon anode batteries are not prototypes, they are already powering applications across aviation, defense, and electric mobility sectors.""

""It's a relief. It really is,"" Williams said. ""We have not really had peace knowing that this could happen at any time -- just relief, actually able to sleep.""

For now, it's a win for Williams, who said the saga has inspired her to run for Brighton City Council.

""Let's put people before profit,"" Williams said. But she will keep an eye on her vacant neighbor.

""I'm going to continue to watch this property and make sure that we get somebody in here that's going to mesh well with what we got going on in this neighborhood,"" Williams said. ""It's not that we're against growth. We just want to make sure it's done responsibly, and make sure it's a company that's going to fit with the neighborhood.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/05/2cd651d9-26de-4eab-a737-982da3da0372/thumbnail/1200x630/29d75a902ccfebbd410abb398b330199/city-of-brighton-colorado.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 20:05:49.237374

“As the nation prepares to celebrate Independence Day, this report underscores the powerful impact of domestic ethanol production on our energy security,” said Geoff Cooper, President and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA). “Even with record levels of U.S. crude oil production, recent global events continue to demonstrate that international oil markets can still influence domestic fuel costs. Ethanol, as a low-cost and reliable gasoline blendstock, provides a critical buffer against those price shocks.”

The study, authored by George Hoekstra of Hoekstra Trading LLC, a veteran in petroleum refining and technology, examines the financial and technical advantages of using ethanol in the U.S. fuel mix. The report compares ethanol with refinery-derived components used to boost gasoline octane levels and finds ethanol to be a far more cost-effective option.

According to Hoekstra’s findings, ethanol provides high-octane value at a fraction of the cost—approximately 4.5 times less than that of refinery-sourced octane. His analysis concludes that the presence of ethanol in the U.S. E10 fuel blend—10% ethanol by volume—lowers the wholesale cost of gasoline by about 39 cents per gallon. Without ethanol, replacing its octane contribution with refinery alternatives would raise costs by $54 billion per year.

The study also indicates that higher ethanol blends like E15, now increasingly available at retail stations, offer even greater savings per gallon of gasoline. E10 remains the standard fuel blend in the U.S., but the report suggests that expanding the use of higher-ethanol blends could lead to deeper cost reductions for consumers.

While the report focuses on octane-related cost impacts, it does not factor in the broader economic benefits of ethanol—particularly its contribution to U.S. fuel supply. Ethanol adds roughly 1 million barrels per day to the fuel market, which also helps stabilize prices by increasing overall supply.

The findings reaffirm ethanol’s role not only in lowering costs at the pump but also in reinforcing American energy independence and reducing vulnerability to global oil disruptions.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ethanol.png,N,,2025-07-05 14:08:55.106264

Launched last November by OneEthos and the Montgomery County Green Bank (MCGB), the initiative aimed to fund 40 to 50 loans in its first year. It hit 40 by March and had more than doubled by the end of May.

""In just a few months, we saw enough loan demand to meet our entire annual budget for the program,"" Rokas Beresniovas, MCGB's senior director of commercial business and climate finance, told Utility Dive.

This success comes despite national headwinds in the residential solar sector, whereby the solar energy market declined by just over 30% in 2024, in addition to the planned end to federal solar tax incentives.

House Republicans are pushing forward a bill that would terminate the Inflation Reduction Act's 30% residential solar tax credit by the end of 2025, as Solar.com explained, as well as gut federal support for clean energy industries.

CEO of OneEthos Marcio deOliveira said the growth of the program isn't ""necessarily"" due to people trying to get ahead of termination of incentives, but the uncertainty could ""accelerate the growth.""

""As we see the possibility of fewer incentives at the federal level,"" deOliveira said, per Utility Dive, ""Green banks become even more important to step up and provide incentives and support at the state and the regional level, to continue programs like this.""

Larger companies getting involved in promoting solar not only helps the environment, it also can be beneficial for the local economy with the creation of jobs. Even other countries are making the move to solar power a priority for their residents.

If you're thinking about adding solar energy to your home, taking advantage of programs like these and any tax incentives while they're still around is paramount. EnergySage's free service can make the process of getting solar panels a little bit easier by enabling you to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar installations.

Now there’s another, major threat to the sector: Mr Trump’s massive tax-and-spending package , which rolls back Mr Biden’s generous green subsidies.
Close to the Kore site is the suburban sprawl that’s come to characterise the Phoenix area’s rapid growth.
It’s one of 53 out of 715 green factories announced since 2021 that have been cancelled, according to Atlas Public Policy.
“Maybe another green energy one will,” he said.","WASHINGTON – The vast tract of land off Route 85 was meant to be a symbol of Made-in-America manufacturing. A billion-dollar battery factory was going to rise, bringing thousands of new jobs. The business announced, “Get Ready Arizona,” the governor said the state was thrilled and even the US president gave the project a shoutout.

But here, in the boomtown of Buckeye, less than an hour away from Phoenix, the 87 ha lot sits empty. Work on the site had started, said Mr Shelby Lizarraga, who manages the gas station next door, “but then it went all quiet.”

Four years after the fanfare, battery maker Kore Power abandoned its plans for a plant in Buckeye. The company’s chief executive officer stepped down and a promised US$850 million (S$1 billion) federal loan was cancelled.

Kore isn’t alone in its dashed ambitions. In Massachusetts, a wind turbine cable factory set to be built on the site of a former coal power plant was scrapped. In Georgia, the construction of a facility that would have made parts for electric vehicle batteries was suspended more than halfway through. And in Colorado, a lithium-ion battery maker said it wouldn’t go forward with its factory there, at least for now.

They’re among the dozens of planned green factories that have been cancelled, with more delayed or downsized, all hit by soaring costs, high interest rates and slow-growing EV demand. About 9 per cent of the US$261 billion in green factory investment announced since 2021 has been shelved – most of it since President Donald Trump returned to office in January – according to research firm Atlas Public Policy.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said his agency doesn’t plan to move forward with some of the big-dollar loans that had been made to green manufacturing plants during president Joe Biden’s term.

Now there’s another, major threat to the sector: Mr Trump’s

massive tax-and-spending package

, which rolls back Mr Biden’s generous green subsidies.

Signed into law by Mr Trump on July 4, it phases out credits for producing solar and wind energy years before they were designed to expire. It also ends federal tax credits for electric vehicles this September instead of in 2032.

Under Mr Biden, a Democratic Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act a year later, setting aside hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for clean-energy projects. New factories were announced from South Carolina to Michigan to Arizona, set to churn out EVs, batteries and clean-energy parts. Biden and Democrats sought to bring manufacturing back to the US and make the country independent of, and competitive with, fast-electrifying China.

Many of the projects would be in red and purple states, shielding the policy against GOP attacks – or so the thinking went. That idea has now collapsed. (Among the members of Congress who voted for Mr Trump’s Bill was Paul Gosar, a Republican who represents Buckeye.)

Mr Trump said at the signing that the country “is going to be a rocketship economically.” But fallout is likely to include more clean energy projects and the jobs they provide, or could have. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had lambasted the package on X as “severely damaging” to “industries of the future.”

The US pulling back now means it will lag other countries that have invested in green technologies, and that will hurt economic growth and boost reliance on overseas manufacturers long term, said Ms Hannah Hess of Rhodium Group, a research firm.

“There’s also the risk of stranded investments, a sizable amount,” she said.

Lithium-ion battery manufacturers like Kore face strict rules on using foreign components, plus knock-on effects from the solar and EV credit phaseouts.

Because of the former, fewer grid batteries will be installed over the next decade, according to the research group Energy Innovation. The demise of the EV credit will likely dent consumer appetite for electric vehicles – and by extension, demand for the batteries they run on.

Buckeye – a former farming town named by settlers from Ohio – is a hotbed of building activity. Close to the Kore site is the suburban sprawl that’s come to characterise the Phoenix area’s rapid growth. Concrete is being poured in foundations and piles of rebar are stacked on construction sites, where tracts of desert are being transformed into new neighbourhoods.

Executives at Kore had scoured 300 sites across the country before settling on Buckeye. Land was cheap, it was close to major West Coast ports and Arizona’s dry climate wouldn’t impair the chemistry of lithium-ion batteries. The company announced its factory in 2021, planning to start construction that year and roll out batteries in 2023. It would be Buckeye’s biggest employer, creating 3,000 jobs.

But as executives drew up construction plans, inflation hiked costs, while rising interest rates made financing more expensive. And the project got mired in the same slow permitting that stalls projects nationwide.

Costs swelled to US$1.25 billion from US$1 billion, so the company made adjustments to control expenses – even downsizing the factory – and worked aggressively to keep the project alive, Kore’s current CEO Jay Bellows said in a telephone interview.

“We were trying to move as fast as we could,” Mr Bellows said. “But ultimately, the costs were just really high.” The battery maker later got a loan commitment from the Energy Department.

Kore ended up getting approvals to move forward with construction in 2024, almost a year after it had wanted to start producing batteries. And then uncertainty loomed over the fate of federal green incentives if Trump were to win the election.

In Buckeye’s city hall, about 10 minutes away from Kore’s site, Mayor Eric Orsborn sensed that things were amiss. The project’s timeline kept getting longer and delays dragged out. “Things slipped a little bit more, a little bit more,” he said in an interview in his office.

Kore then said it was ending its plans to build in Buckeye, 10 days after Mr Trump was sworn in. It’s one of 53 out of 715 green factories announced since 2021 that have been cancelled, according to Atlas Public Policy.

The outlook for green enterprises has darkened as policy shifts unsettle manufacturers, with EV makers feeling it the most, said Mr Matt Shanahan of Marathon Capital, an investment bank focused on the energy transition. “The rules have changed,” he said.

The pace of cancellations and delays depends on how the market reacts to the law, he added, but early-stage projects are especially at risk. “To break ground on a new facility – I think it’s very challenging right now.” Energy storage may remain more resilient thanks to surging data center demand, he said.

Kore is now on the hunt for an existing building to move into, with power and infrastructure in place so it can save money and get to market faster, Mr Bellows said.

Looking back, he said he learned the need to move more quickly and efficiently. The company tried, he said, but “it’s a long, arduous process” to go from dirt to a fully operating factory.

Even so, other green facilities in the region are forging ahead. In Queen Creek, another fast-growing community that’s about 80 miles to the west of Buckeye, construction is underway on a US$3 billion EV battery facility by LG Energy Solution.

Cranes tower over the sprawling site, while bulldozers kick up plumes of desert dust as forklifts scuttle by. The project has faced its own challenges – construction was paused for some time last year as the company scrapped plans for a bigger plant.

But now the factory is set to open next year, and LG plans to employ 1,500 workers there by 2027. The company said in an April press release that it aims to contribute to a “local battery ecosystem” and that it will hire locally.

“It’s a manufacturing powerhouse,” Queen Creek Mayor Julia Wheatley said in an interview, adding that the town is seeing strong interest from companies looking to move near the plant.

On a Monday in late June, the empty Kore plot scorched in 100F-plus heat. Nearby, desert gave way to parcels of farmland, discount stores and palm-tree-lined neighborhoods. Dairy cows took shade from the heat, while trucks stacked with hay bales hurtled by.

Across the road, Mr Joe Skoog, who runs a trucking company, said he would have liked to have pitched his business to Kore had the factory gone ahead. But he didn’t see the cancellation as much of a setback for the growing region. “Come back in five, 10 years’ time, and there will be more manufacturers and warehouses, and fewer farms,” he said.

Orsborn, Buckeye’s mayor, said he was disappointed, but not disheartened. He enthused about Buckeye’s population boom, fueled by Californian transplants, the big-box retailers and movie theaters opening up and how Kore’s shovel-ready site – with power, water and infrastructure now installed – is now even more attractive for other businesses that want to move in.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has restored a severely degraded Class 3 electric truck from a reported ~40-kilometer range to an estimated 295 kilometers range per charge under no-load conditions (a 255-kilometer increase; 637.5% improvement) based on results from controlled real-world performance trials.

Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending battery rebalancing platform, demonstrated breakthrough results in the field by fully restoring lost capacity in a 144-cell NMC battery pack exhibiting severe natural cell imbalance-achieving 100% recovery of imbalance-related losses and delivering a 37.7% increase in Rated Capacity.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed of a broader commercial opportunity following reports of widespread battery degradation across similar electric trucks in active service-underscoring growing demand for a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution to extend battery life and reduce operating costs for commercial EV stakeholders.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news release dated June 6, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a real-world driving trial demonstrating a significant increase in estimated driving range for a fully electric, Class 3 commercial electric vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck""), following a full battery rebalancing process using the Company's patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

As part of its ongoing performance validation program for Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies recently conducted a series of real-world road tests on a rebalanced Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing driving range and battery efficiency. The Electric Truck was supplied by an authorized Canadian distributor of the Electric Truck (the ""Electric Truck Authorized Distributor"") and, as represented by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, had previously demonstrated a significantly degraded driving range of approximately 40 kilometers per full charge caused by significant natural cell imbalance caused by real-world conditions.

In response to this battery capacity performance deficiency, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies performed a battery rebalancing procedure on the Electric Truck utilizing Prototype 2.0, as initially disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 6, 2025. During the associated rebalancing trial (the ""Rebalancing Trial""), Battery X Rebalancing Technologies successfully completed a full rebalancing process on a 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack composed of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry, which had exhibited substantial imbalance attributable to real-world operating conditions. The Rebalancing Trial demonstrated complete (100%) recovery of imbalance-related capacity loss and yielded a 37.7% increase in the Rated Capacity (as defined in the June 6, 2025 news release) of the Electric Truck's battery pack.

The Results

Following completion of the rebalancing procedure, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a series of controlled real-world performance evaluations (each, a ""Trial"" and collectively, the ""Battery Range Performance Trials"") on the Electric Truck for the purpose of assessing post-rebalancing improvements in battery range and overall energy efficiency under actual operating conditions. In the first Trial, the Electric Truck traveled a total distance of 41 kilometers, utilizing approximately 14% of its available battery capacity, while operating across a combination of highway and city driving environments. In the second Trial, the vehicle completed a distance of 107.3 kilometers while consuming approximately 35% of its battery capacity, under similarly mixed driving conditions. The third Trial, conducted exclusively under city driving conditions, demonstrated that the vehicle traveled 58.2 kilometers while utilizing approximately 21% of its available battery charge (collectively, the ""Results"").

The Results demonstrate a material improvement in the estimated driving range and effective battery capacity of the Electric Truck. Specifically, post-rebalancing performance testing indicates an estimated driving range of approximately 295 kilometers per full charge under no-load conditions. These figures represent an increase of up to 255 kilometers in driving range under no-load conditions, corresponding to an approximately 637.5% improvement of battery driving range, as compared to the pre-rebalancing range of approximately 40 kilometers. The Results affirm the technical efficacy and commercial relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing process and support its broader applicability within light-duty electric vehicle fleets and other commercial electric transportation use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 kilometers. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Battery Range Performance Trials yielded an estimated range of approximately 295 kilometers under no-load conditions following rebalancing. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Battery Range Performance Trials were performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.

These performance outcomes further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide compelling technical validation in support of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Significance of Results & Market Opportunity for the Electric Truck

The Results of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials collectively demonstrate that Prototype 2.0 is capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only validate the technical efficacy of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Company's patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Battery Range Performance Trials further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of aging battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Electric Truck and associated Electric Truck battery pack were supplied to Battery X Rebalancing Technologies at no cost for testing and evaluation by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, who advised that it owns and operates a fleet of approximately 20 Electric Trucks (the ""Electric Truck Fleet""). According to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, multiple vehicles within the Electric Truck Fleet have exhibited material battery degradation and capacity loss attributable to cell imbalance. The Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials were undertaken in response to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's request for a viable alternative to full battery replacement, which it advised may be financially prohibitive on a fleet-wide basis.

The objective of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials was to determine whether Prototype 2.0 could effectively restore functional battery performance in a degraded battery unit sourced from the Electric Truck Fleet. Upon successful rebalancing, the Battery Range Performance Trials further aimed to quantify the extent of recovered battery capacity in terms of estimated driving range. The positive Results are expected to inform and support ongoing discussions with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor regarding the potential deployment of the rebalancing solution across its broader fleet, with the goal of extending battery life and mitigating the operational and financial impact of premature battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor that a substantial number of similar electric trucks are currently in operation across various markets, including those held by the Electric Truck's parent company, authorized distributors, commercial fleet operators, and private owners. Many of these vehicles are reportedly experiencing battery degradation symptoms consistent with cell imbalance. This feedback underscores a broader market opportunity for Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to provide a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution aimed at extending battery life and reducing total cost of ownership for commercial EV stakeholders.

In conjunction with the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is currently advancing the development of standardized operating procedures (""SOPs"") tailored to the Electric Truck Battery Pack, in addition to refining user interface and workflow enhancements within Prototype 2.0. The Company is also actively pursuing a commercial manufacturing agreement to support scalable production and deployment of its rebalancing platform. These activities are intended to further the Company's broader commercialization strategy, which is not limited to any single third-party opportunity. The Electric Truck-specific SOPs, however, are being developed in direct response to the successful Battery Range Performance Trials and the interest expressed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor.

There can be no assurance that Battery X Rebalancing Technologies will enter into any definitive commercial arrangement with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor or any other third party at this time. While the Company remains encouraged by the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, which demonstrate an apparent need in the marketplace, any future commercial arrangement will be subject to further technical validation, negotiation of mutually acceptable terms, and completion of all necessary operational readiness milestones.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 20231. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units2, a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage3,4. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements5. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

Insight: Not Dead, But Wounded Rooftop solar isn’t gone—but without the federal credit, it becomes a harder sell.","The U.S. residential solar sector is bracing for turmoil after President Donald Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” was signed into law, effectively gutting the 30% federal tax credit for homeowners who install rooftop solar systems.

Once a cornerstone of clean energy policy, the residential credit under Section 25D of the tax code will now vanish at the end of 2025—nearly a decade earlier than scheduled under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Originally set to run through 2034, the incentive has helped millions of Americans afford solar systems that reduce their utility bills and decrease their reliance on fossil fuels.

However, with the new law, homeowners now have a narrow window—until December 31, 2025—to claim the credit, which is worth roughly $9,000 for an average 11-kilowatt system.

Who This Hurts

The sudden policy shift could price out tens of thousands of middle-income families who depend on the tax credit to make solar feasible.

According to a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study, nearly 44% of solar adopters in 2023 had household incomes under $100,000.

“This is going to devastate working families,” said Will Etheridge, CEO of Southern Energy Management in North Carolina, who warned his 190 employees that layoffs are imminent. “It’s a bait and switch.”

His sentiment is echoed across the industry. A recent EnergySage survey of over 150 solar installers found that over 92% expect serious harm to their businesses, with nearly 6% planning to exit the market entirely.

Commercial Projects

Residential solar credits are being phased out quickly, but commercial and utility-scale solar projects governed under Section 48E will retain their credits until at least 2028.

However, new content requirements are set to increase: by 2026, 40% of system components must be made in the U.S., rising to 60% by 2030. This gives third-party-owned systems, such as leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs), a temporary advantage.

It’s important to note that the benefits of these models primarily accrue to companies rather than consumers, which means homeowners may experience reduced long-term savings.

Rising Costs Loom

The timing of the rollback is particularly troubling. U.S. electricity demand is projected to increase by 130% by 2030, driven in part by the growth of AI data centers and the trend toward electrification. Utilities are racing to expand generation and grid infrastructure—costs that ultimately fall on ratepayers.

Rooftop solar, often deployed more quickly than centralized infrastructure, could help alleviate grid pressure. Without it, analysts warn, the U.S. faces a higher risk of rolling blackouts, price spikes, and stalled efforts to reduce emissions.

Energy prices are already on the rise. Analysts project that typical households could see bills climb by over $140 annually. Solar offered a hedge. Without the federal tax credit, the barrier to entry just got steeper.

Impact on Jobs

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) estimates the repeal will cost the residential solar sector over 60,000 jobs by the end of this year and nearly 200,000 by the end of 2026.

That’s a heavy blow for an industry that has added jobs five times faster than the overall U.S. economy in recent years.

Clean energy companies across the country have already reported bankruptcies, project cancellations, and hiring freezes. The North Carolina-based NC Solar Now, which relies on residential projects for 85% of its business, expects to lay off half its workforce.

“This bill took the savings from average Americans and handed it back to big utilities,” said Karl Stupka, the company’s president.

Insight: Not Dead, But Wounded

Rooftop solar isn’t gone—but without the federal credit, it becomes a harder sell. Payback periods will lengthen from 8–10 years to possibly 15–20, depending on local electricity rates and state-level support. Prices have dropped to $2.50 per watt, but time is running out.

For homeowners eyeing solar, the message is clear: If you want the credit, act fast.

For the industry, the law represents a retreat from two decades of bipartisan clean energy policy—and a warning shot to an economy still struggling to decarbonize at scale.",https://pvbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/donald-trump.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 16:07:04.835307

“The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers meaningful spending cuts while taking major steps to create a pro-business environment.","Thursday’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill generated responses from North Dakota’s representatives in Washington and from others across the state.

North Dakota Farmers Union President Mark Watne called the budget reconciliation package “a mixed bag.”

“There is a lot of good in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ that will strengthen the farm safety net. We appreciate the improvements made to farm programs and tax provisions impacting agriculture and farmer-owned cooperatives,” Wayne said.

Farm bill provisions that NDFU supported include an increase in commodity reference prices to better reflect the cost of production, improved crop insurance support, improvements to livestock disaster programs, and a permanent pass-through tax deduction to maintain equity for farmer-owned cooperatives.

However, Watne said federal funding cuts to programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) run counterintuitive to farmers and ranchers who are in the business of feeding people.

“Big picture, the legislation and the reconciliation process sets a dangerous precedent in the way we draft future farm bills,” he said. “There was less opportunity to debate the merits and challenges of programs and draft bipartisan legislation that fits the needs of urban and rural voters as the farm bill is more than just farm policy. It is a food security act for our nation.”

Sen. John Hoeven, R-ND, responded, “The One Big Beautiful Bill will make our nation more prosperous and more secure. We worked to pass this legislation to provide permanent tax relief for American families that will enable them to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. We invest in priorities like border security, national defense, unleashing American energy dominance and passing the heart and soul of the farm bill for our farmers and ranchers. At the same time, we find $1.6 trillion in savings to help with our debt and deficit. This bill delivers on the priorities that President Trump promised to get our nation back on track.”

“At the heart of this bill is a simple principle: Americans should be able to keep more of what they earn. It will help jumpstart our economy, encourage investment and help people who work hard get ahead again,” Congresswoman Juli Fedorchak, R-ND, said.

“I was proud to help move it forward, because North Dakotans — and Americans everywhere — are tired of waste, tired of overreach, and ready for the pro-America policies included in this bill to enact President Trump’s agenda,” she added. “The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers meaningful spending cuts while taking major steps to create a pro-business environment. It’s a pro-growth package that will stimulate investment, increase revenues and help bring down our national deficit. Addressing our nation’s out-of-control spending is a top priority and we must do more. This bill puts us on stronger financial footing by pairing significant spending reforms with policies that help the American economy thrive.”

However, Democrats took a different stance.

“This is a scheme to steal from working North Dakotans, struggling families, and even from nursing homes, to pay for a massive tax giveaway to the megawealthy like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk,” North Dakota Democratic-NPL chair Adam Goldwyn said. He added the state’s congressional delegation “just voted to rip health care away from thousands of North Dakotans, take food from hungry children and kill jobs across the country. This bill is as cruel as it is unpopular. Even Republican voters do not like this bill. Our Republican lawmakers may have abandoned North Dakota, but we will continue to fight this and the many other cuts our state has been forced to suffer under Trump.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.minotdailynews.com/images/2016/11/03084632/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 18:05:35.133835

Despite this reliability and growing interest in clean energy, tidal power still accounts for only a small share of global electricity production.
There are three main ways to capture tidal energy: tidal barrages (low dams that trap water), tidal stream turbines (underwater turbines placed in fast-moving currents), and dynamic tidal power systems (which use coastal water pressure differences).

What’s the latest in tidal energy?

Mary W., New York, NY

Tidal energy—generated from the natural rise and fall of ocean tides—is one of the most predictable forms of renewable energy. Unlike wind or solar, which fluctuate based on weather, tides follow gravitational cycles that are easy to forecast. Despite this reliability and growing interest in clean energy, tidal power still accounts for only a small share of global electricity production.

There are three main ways to capture tidal energy: tidal barrages (low dams that trap water), tidal stream turbines (underwater turbines placed in fast-moving currents), and dynamic tidal power systems (which use coastal water pressure differences).

One of the most recent breakthroughs happened in early 2025, when Proteus Marine Renewables installed Japan’s first commercial-scale tidal turbine off the coast of Goto City. The 1.1 megawatt (MW) device, anchored to the seabed, shows how far the technology has come. “This milestone demonstrates that tidal energy is ready for prime time in Asia and beyond,” said Proteus CEO Andrew Clark.

Tidal energy offers several key advantages. It has high energy density, doesn’t depend on weather or sunlight, and has less impact on land and views than wind or solar farms. As Inc. Magazine’s Chris Stokel-Walker put it, “Tidal power is more reliable than solar. Why aren’t we using it?”

The answer largely concerns cost and location. Tidal systems are expensive to build and maintain, especially when placed offshore. They also only work well in coastal areas with strong, steady tides — limiting where projects can go. Additionally, there are environmental concerns about how turbines might affect marine life and sediment flow. In the U.S., permitting and regulatory processes can be slow and confusing, making it difficult to get new projects started. Local opposition from fishing communities and unclear jurisdiction over coastal waters have also slowed progress in key regions like the Pacific Northwest and parts of New England.

Still, momentum is building. Scotland, France and Canada have invested in pilot projects, and the U.S. Department of Energy is researching opportunities along American coastlines. New modular turbine designs are helping lower costs and speed up installation, an important factor to the continued development of tidal energy. As Professor Brian Polagye says, “The fundamental question is one of economics”—tidal power is still expensive and often built on a case-by-case basis, so growth will depend on more standardized designs, better supply chains, and steady long-term investment.

If tidal energy is to grow, it will need more research, better policies and stronger public support. Advocates can push for clean energy plans that include marine renewables and support companies working to improve the technology. Tidal power won’t replace solar and wind, but it could become an important part of a cleaner, more reliable energy mix if given the chance.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing.","News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has restored a severely degraded Class 3 electric truck from a reported ~40-kilometer range to an estimated 295 kilometers range per charge under no-load conditions (a 255-kilometer increase; 637.5% improvement) based on results from controlled real-world performance trials.

Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending battery rebalancing platform, demonstrated breakthrough results in the field by fully restoring lost capacity in a 144-cell NMC battery pack exhibiting severe natural cell imbalance-achieving 100% recovery of imbalance-related losses and delivering a 37.7% increase in Rated Capacity.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed of a broader commercial opportunity following reports of widespread battery degradation across similar electric trucks in active service-underscoring growing demand for a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution to extend battery life and reduce operating costs for commercial EV stakeholders.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news release dated June 6, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a real-world driving trial demonstrating a significant increase in estimated driving range for a fully electric, Class 3 commercial electric vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck""), following a full battery rebalancing process using the Company's patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

As part of its ongoing performance validation program for Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies recently conducted a series of real-world road tests on a rebalanced Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing driving range and battery efficiency. The Electric Truck was supplied by an authorized Canadian distributor of the Electric Truck (the ""Electric Truck Authorized Distributor"") and, as represented by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, had previously demonstrated a significantly degraded driving range of approximately 40 kilometers per full charge caused by significant natural cell imbalance caused by real-world conditions.

In response to this battery capacity performance deficiency, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies performed a battery rebalancing procedure on the Electric Truck utilizing Prototype 2.0, as initially disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 6, 2025. During the associated rebalancing trial (the ""Rebalancing Trial""), Battery X Rebalancing Technologies successfully completed a full rebalancing process on a 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack composed of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry, which had exhibited substantial imbalance attributable to real-world operating conditions. The Rebalancing Trial demonstrated complete (100%) recovery of imbalance-related capacity loss and yielded a 37.7% increase in the Rated Capacity (as defined in the June 6, 2025 news release) of the Electric Truck's battery pack.

The Results

Following completion of the rebalancing procedure, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a series of controlled real-world performance evaluations (each, a ""Trial"" and collectively, the ""Battery Range Performance Trials"") on the Electric Truck for the purpose of assessing post-rebalancing improvements in battery range and overall energy efficiency under actual operating conditions. In the first Trial, the Electric Truck traveled a total distance of 41 kilometers, utilizing approximately 14% of its available battery capacity, while operating across a combination of highway and city driving environments. In the second Trial, the vehicle completed a distance of 107.3 kilometers while consuming approximately 35% of its battery capacity, under similarly mixed driving conditions. The third Trial, conducted exclusively under city driving conditions, demonstrated that the vehicle traveled 58.2 kilometers while utilizing approximately 21% of its available battery charge (collectively, the ""Results"").

The Results demonstrate a material improvement in the estimated driving range and effective battery capacity of the Electric Truck. Specifically, post-rebalancing performance testing indicates an estimated driving range of approximately 295 kilometers per full charge under no-load conditions. These figures represent an increase of up to 255 kilometers in driving range under no-load conditions, corresponding to an approximately 637.5% improvement of battery driving range, as compared to the pre-rebalancing range of approximately 40 kilometers. The Results affirm the technical efficacy and commercial relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing process and support its broader applicability within light-duty electric vehicle fleets and other commercial electric transportation use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 kilometers. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Battery Range Performance Trials yielded an estimated range of approximately 295 kilometers under no-load conditions following rebalancing. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Battery Range Performance Trials were performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.

These performance outcomes further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide compelling technical validation in support of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Significance of Results & Market Opportunity for the Electric Truck

The Results of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials collectively demonstrate that Prototype 2.0 is capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only validate the technical efficacy of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Company's patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Battery Range Performance Trials further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of aging battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Electric Truck and associated Electric Truck battery pack were supplied to Battery X Rebalancing Technologies at no cost for testing and evaluation by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, who advised that it owns and operates a fleet of approximately 20 Electric Trucks (the ""Electric Truck Fleet""). According to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, multiple vehicles within the Electric Truck Fleet have exhibited material battery degradation and capacity loss attributable to cell imbalance. The Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials were undertaken in response to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's request for a viable alternative to full battery replacement, which it advised may be financially prohibitive on a fleet-wide basis.

The objective of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials was to determine whether Prototype 2.0 could effectively restore functional battery performance in a degraded battery unit sourced from the Electric Truck Fleet. Upon successful rebalancing, the Battery Range Performance Trials further aimed to quantify the extent of recovered battery capacity in terms of estimated driving range. The positive Results are expected to inform and support ongoing discussions with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor regarding the potential deployment of the rebalancing solution across its broader fleet, with the goal of extending battery life and mitigating the operational and financial impact of premature battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor that a substantial number of similar electric trucks are currently in operation across various markets, including those held by the Electric Truck's parent company, authorized distributors, commercial fleet operators, and private owners. Many of these vehicles are reportedly experiencing battery degradation symptoms consistent with cell imbalance. This feedback underscores a broader market opportunity for Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to provide a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution aimed at extending battery life and reducing total cost of ownership for commercial EV stakeholders.

In conjunction with the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is currently advancing the development of standardized operating procedures (""SOPs"") tailored to the Electric Truck Battery Pack, in addition to refining user interface and workflow enhancements within Prototype 2.0. The Company is also actively pursuing a commercial manufacturing agreement to support scalable production and deployment of its rebalancing platform. These activities are intended to further the Company's broader commercialization strategy, which is not limited to any single third-party opportunity. The Electric Truck-specific SOPs, however, are being developed in direct response to the successful Battery Range Performance Trials and the interest expressed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor.

There can be no assurance that Battery X Rebalancing Technologies will enter into any definitive commercial arrangement with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor or any other third party at this time. While the Company remains encouraged by the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, which demonstrate an apparent need in the marketplace, any future commercial arrangement will be subject to further technical validation, negotiation of mutually acceptable terms, and completion of all necessary operational readiness milestones.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 20231. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units2, a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage3,4. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements5. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

Ager mentioned that they used to take on smaller projects, including off-grid solar, but now they focus solely on integrating solar and batteries into entire buildings.
While a large part of the solar industry is engaged in building utility-scale solar projects, Ager stated that Sugar Hollow is “focused on distributed energy, or helping individuals or commercial property owners ‘go solar.’” Sugar Hollow employs 65 people and services Western North Carolina as well as Upstate South Carolina.
“Solar energy is clean energy, and it’s a low-maintenance technology because there are no moving parts.” It involves no grimy oil changes, no fumes, and no wear and tear.

They grew up working on Hickory Nut Gap Farm in Fairview and spent a lot of time playing in the woods, “and learned to really love the land and wanted to do right by the planet.” Ager explained, “I see myself as a builder, and I want to build something that has a meaningful impact.”

The business started as a vertically integrated, one-stop solar shop. The cousins handled the sales, design, and installation of the solar panels. Ager mentioned that they used to take on smaller projects, including off-grid solar, but now they focus solely on integrating solar and batteries into entire buildings. While a large part of the solar industry is engaged in building utility-scale solar projects, Ager stated that Sugar Hollow is “focused on distributed energy, or helping individuals or commercial property owners ‘go solar.’”

Sugar Hollow employs 65 people and services Western North Carolina as well as Upstate South Carolina. Although the majority of their projects have been on single-family homes, an increasing portion of their work is in the commercial sector with businesses, developers, and community leaders. Some of their recent projects include Brevard Music School, Hunter Subaru, the Asheville Jewish Community Center, St. James Episcopal Church, and Evergreen Charter School.

“Solar energy is clean energy, and it’s a low-maintenance technology because there are no moving parts.” It involves no grimy oil changes, no fumes, and no wear and tear. Ager explained that Sugar Hollow has a service department because solar cells only generate voltage for electrical systems. They work with standard electrical systems that can fail. For that reason, Sugar Hollow’s panels come with a 25-year manufacturer warranty.

One challenge people face in going solar is that the world has built infrastructure around “the old way of doing things,” with large power plants generating power for many houses. Solar, on the other hand, provides homeowners with the opportunity to generate their own power and push it onto the grid. “Batteries are providing a pathway for stabilizing the future energy grid,” said Ager.

The dealbreaker for many potential customers is the upfront installation cost, especially now when interest rates are high. Tax credits have been crucial in promoting the technology. Yet, “demand from homeowners hasn’t risen to the point that entrepreneurs are scrambling into the field and innovating the economies of scale that will make solar more affordable.” However, demand from data centers and solar farms has the potential to change this.

Unfortunately, “in America, entrenched businesses are often slow to change.” Utilities, for example, have large lobbying arms to legislate against lateral entry into their space. “And so rooftop solar installers find themselves joining other industry groups to make sure their voices are heard.” Ager mentioned that he was in Washington, DC recently doing just that.

These days, businesses are all affected by uncertainties at the federal level. Ager noted that tariffs were initially a major concern, but over the last few years, the industry has onshored much manufacturing, which has helped stabilize supply chains. What remains concerning is the hesitancy created in the market by proposals to eliminate tax credits. Several bills are circulating; one would sunset incentives at the end of the year, while another would terminate them 180 days after the bill’s passage. “Activities at the state level are also underway to slow the transition to renewables.”

Ager is trying to persuade leaders that if they are intent on eliminating incentives, they should at least create a reasonable phase-down to prevent developers from abandoning projects due to uncertainty about whether incentives will be withdrawn. With a bittersweet tone, Ager remarked that this would be a good time for people considering whether and when to go solar to make the plunge while these incentives are still in place.",https://tribpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lolar_install_2-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 18:06:27.718379

“Americans across the country are opposed to this bill, on every count and every measure.” Outside of the legislature, Americans have had a mixed but largely negative response to the bill.
One poll from KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, showed a majority of Americans viewed the bill unfavorably, including most non-MAGA Republicans.","Politicos across Pennsylvania are reacting with a mix of triumph, anger and despair following the passage of the federal budget resolution.

Once enacted, the law will support a massive expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, make sweeping cuts to programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, offer huge tax breaks and, many say, fundamentally change the nation while increasing the national debt.

Ahead of yesterday’s vote, the commonwealth’s highest elected official, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, warned, “the bill Congressional Republicans are rushing to pass would have devastating impacts on Pennsylvania.”

Lt. Gov. Austin Davis shared his sentiment, calling the bill “absurdly cruel and unconscionable.”

The governor highlighted Republican-led districts, noting how many would lose health care coverage in each. In total, over 300,000 Pennsylvanians are expected to lose Medicaid and about half as many to lose SNAP.

U.S. Rep. John Joyce wrote in a Facebook post that he was “incredibly proud to deliver on President Donald J. Trump’s America First agenda with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill.”

He listed tax relief for Main Street businesses, increased border security funding and avoiding a major tax increase as some of the wins for the American people and his 13th District constituents.

“We promised to deliver for the American people, and today, that promise became a reality,” Joyce wrote.

In staunch Trump ally Rep. Scott Perry’s central Pennsylvania district, the number exceeds 18,700. Perry did ultimately vote for the bill, despite initial misgivings about the increased debt it presents.

Perry’s fellow Republican House member Rep. Ryan Mackenzie issued a press release detailing the gains he saw for his constituents.

“As we began this term, we understood what the people of the Greater Lehigh Valley were counting on: lower costs, a stronger economy, secure borders, and policies that put America First,” Mackenzie said. “In the face of relentless opposition from those who advocated for the largest tax increase in American history and a return to open borders, we’ve passed a budget that holds firm and keeps our promise to the American people.”

Mackenzie’s colleague across the aisle, progressive Democrat Rep. Summer Lee of Pittsburgh, voted against the bill.

“This is a deliberate choice to make life harder for working families here in Western Pennsylvania and across the country, to strip dignity from our seniors, to push children and parents deeper into poverty and hunger,” Lee wrote. “I will continue doing everything in my power to mitigate the harm and fight back against this fascist regime.”

The state’s Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick posted to X, “Congratulations to @POTUS for putting his vision into action and to Leader Thune and Speaker Johnson for putting so much of that agenda in one bill.”

McCormick highlighted tax relief, border security, “energy dominance,” defense and school choice as wins in the bill, saying, “These are the policies I promised to pass and they’ll make a real difference for the people of Pennsylvania.”

In terms of energy dominance, recent claims that China has pulled away from the U.S. to become the global leader have roiled the states. Some believe the best answer is to double down on the nation’s wealth of fossil fuel resources, while others insist that Biden-era clean energy incentives were key to keeping up with competitors.

Pennsylvania state representative and Democratic National Committee Vice Chair Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia posted to BlueSky, “The budget Republicans passed is a death knell to health care for 17 million Americans, will send kids to school hungry, hurt seniors, raise our energy prices and the list goes on. All to give a tax break to the ultra rich. And they are (expletive) celebrating it. VOTE THEM OUT!!!”

His account featured a screenshot of a since-deleted X post from Wisconsin Rep. Derrick Van Orden, which seemed to cheer the loss of safety nets for millions.

Pennsylvania House Speaker Joanna McClinton, D-Philadelphia, wrote, “I am disgusted that on the eve of our nation’s celebration of independence and triumph over tyranny, that Republicans in Congress have risked American freedom by thrusting us back under the control of an authoritarian leader; pledging their allegiance to Donald Trump and ignoring the people they represent.”

Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward, a Republican, posted a graphic on X from the White House celebrating the tax breaks, defense spending, clean energy rollbacks, and immigration enforcement afforded by the bill.

Of the Medicaid cuts, she wrote, “Don’t let the media gaslight you. PA’s Medicaid programs are spiraling out of control — and taxpayers are stuck with the bill. Enrollment has more than doubled to over 3 million residents, despite the state experiencing out-migration & population growth.”

Her Democratic colleague from Philadelphia, Sen. Nikil Saval, wrote that the bill “is a legislative abomination.”

“People who would do this to their neighbors and fellow Americans cannot meaningfully be said to be ‘public servants.’ The divorce between what the American people want, and what their representatives delivered, is total,” wrote Saval. “Americans across the country are opposed to this bill, on every count and every measure.”

Article content

Four years after the fanfare, battery maker Kore Power Inc. abandoned its plans for a plant in Buckeye. The company’s chief executive officer stepped down and a promised $850 million federal loan was cancelled.

Article content

Kore isn’t alone in its dashed ambitions. In Massachusetts, a wind turbine cable factory set to be built on the site of a former coal power plant was scrapped. In Georgia, the construction of a facility that would have made parts for electric vehicle batteries was suspended more than halfway through. And in Colorado, a lithium-ion battery maker said it wouldn’t go forward with its factory there, at least for now.

Article content

They’re among the dozens of planned green factories that have been cancelled, with more delayed or downsized, all hit by soaring costs, high interest rates and slow-growing EV demand. About 9% of the $261 billion in green factory investment announced since 2021 has been shelved — most of it since President Donald Trump returned to office in January — according to research firm Atlas Public Policy. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said his agency doesn’t plan to move forward with some of the big-dollar loans that had been made to green manufacturing plants during President Joe Biden’s term.

Under Biden, a Democratic Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act a year later, setting aside hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for clean-energy projects.

The company will also slash dividend payouts by nearly a third this year as lower oil prices hit its income.

The state, which directly owns 81.5% of Aramco, is heavily reliant on the payouts, which include royalties and taxes.

Besides the sale of the gas-fired plants, the company could divest assets such as housing compounds and pipelines, two of the sources said. Port infrastructure assets could also be up for sale, one of them and a third person said.

Aramco declined to comment on the potential asset sales and had no immediate comment on the amount of money the fundraising drive could yield.

The Saudi government communications office did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Reuters could not determine a timeline for the sale. The three sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is private.

Local businesses like Saudi utility firms could be interested buyers, one of the people said.

Aramco fully or partly owned 18 power plants and related infrastructure locally supplying energy to its gas plants and refineries, according to its 2024 financial report.

Other power plants are expected to come onstream soon. The Tanajib Gas Plant project is expected to start operations this year.

The potential asset sales by Aramco coincide with Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s planned massive domestic projects to diversify the economy from oil while facing pressure from tumbling crude prices.

Oil receipts made up 62% of state revenues last year with the Saudi budget showing a deficit of more than $30 billion in 2024 despite a $199 billion windfall from Aramco.

Aramco sold $5 billion of bonds in May and signalled more borrowing.

The country is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into projects including showpiece events like the Expo 2030 world fair and soccer’s FIFA World Cup 2034.

This decline, reported by BMW of North America, highlights shifting consumer preferences and challenges in the EV market, even as the automaker’s traditional passenger cars and MINI brand show robust growth.

Electrified Lineup Faces Steep Declines

BMW’s EV portfolio struggled in Q2 2025, with sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) falling to 11,094 units, down from 14,081 units in Q2 2024. The flagship i5 sedan saw the sharpest drop, with sales plummeting 43.6% to 1,434 units. The i7 luxury sedan decreased by 11.7% to 820 units, while the iX SUV fell 12.1% to 3,116 units. The i4, a bright spot in prior quarters, also declined 19%. For the first half of 2025, BMW sold 24,632 BEVs, a slight 0.7% dip from 24,794 units in H1 2024.

These declines align with broader industry challenges, including tariff-related disruptions that paused EV shipments to dealerships. Additionally, none of BMW’s EVs qualify for the full $7,500 federal tax credit in 2025 due to battery sourcing restrictions, potentially impacting affordability compared to competitors like Tesla, which retains full incentives for models like the Model 3 and Model Y.

Passenger Cars and MINI Drive Growth

While EVs struggled, BMW’s passenger cars and MINI brand bolstered overall performance. In H1 2025, BMW sold 178,499 vehicles in North America, up 1.6% from 175,712 in H1 2024. Passenger car sales surged 11.2% year-over-year, with Q2 alone showing a 9.7% increase. MINI sales soared 19% in H1, reaching 14,592 units, and jumped 29.1% in Q2, adding 1,718 vehicles over Q2 2024.

“Our sales performance over the first half of the year is a clear indication that we have the right strategy, products, and dealer network to succeed,” said Sebastian Mackensen, President and CEO, BMW of North America. “We’re confident in our business and look forward to building on this progress in the second half of the year, despite some challenges in the marketplace.”

Industry Trends and Future Outlook

The EV sales drop reflects a cautious North American market, where consumers appear less enthusiastic about electrification than automakers anticipated. BMW’s “Light Truck” SUV segment, including models like the X3 and X5, fell 5.9% in H1 and 7.7% in Q2, suggesting a broader softening in demand for larger vehicles. Meanwhile, the success of passenger cars and MINI’s compact offerings indicates buyers favor efficiency and affordability amid economic uncertainty.

BMW’s EV strategy faces hurdles, but the upcoming Neue Klasse platform, debuting in 2026 with the iX3 and i3, promises improved range and performance on a dedicated EV architecture. For now, the 21.2% Q2 EV sales decline—equating to roughly 2,987 fewer vehicles—underscores the need for competitive pricing and incentives. With potential changes to the $7,500 tax credit looming, BMW must navigate regulatory and economic headwinds to regain EV momentum.

As part of its strategy, the government said it is set to unlock up to 10 GW of onshore wind by resolving issues with how onshore wind turbines and aerospace civil and defence infrastructure co-exist.
Delivering this strategy could more than double the current onshore wind workforce, supporting up to 45,000 jobs across the country by 2030, as the government pursues its clean power ambition of 27-29 GW of onshore wind by 2030.
""Together we are forging a path forward for onshore wind in Great Britain, and we are committed to ensuring a successful implementation through a new Onshore Wind Council, which will oversee the execution of the strategy.
James Robottom, head of Onshore Wind Deliveryat RenewableUK, said: ""Overturning the unpopular onshore wind ban, which deprived us of one of the quickest and cheapest technologies to build for a decade, was just the start.","The amount of clean, homegrown energy from onshore wind is set to accelerate over the second half of the decade as the government launches its first ever onshore wind strategy.

Thousands of new jobs are set to be created in the sector by 2030, including those working in engineering, construction, and operations maintenance, to build the onshore wind needed to deliver clean power for households and businesses.

As part of its strategy, the government said it is set to unlock up to 10 GW of onshore wind by resolving issues with how onshore wind turbines and aerospace civil and defence infrastructure co-exist.

It will also repower old turbines across the country to maintain current fleet and keep ""powering the country with clean, secure, homegrown power.""

The government also said it will equip planners and developers with the tools needed for the first English projects since the de facto ban was lifted, including making planning decisions based on up-to-date information and ensuring site surveying and assessments for projects are more efficient.

It will also explore plans to expand the clean industry bonus for onshore wind, encouraging developers to invest in supply chains in the UK's industrial heartlands or in cleaner supply chains.

Delivering this strategy could more than double the current onshore wind workforce, supporting up to 45,000 jobs across the country by 2030, as the government pursues its clean power ambition of 27-29 GW of onshore wind by 2030.

The government says that clean energy is the ""economic opportunity of the twenty-first century"", and investment in the sector is booming in the UK, with over £40bn of private investment in clean energy announced since July.

Onshore wind is also one of the easiest and cheapest technologies to build. It will supply British homes and businesses with clean, secure homegrown power that ends a reliance on unstable global gas markets, which the government says is, ""all part of the mission to get bills down for good.""

The measures being put in place mean that onshore wind will be put on an ""equal footing"" to offshore wind and nuclear, meaning projects can get built quicker in the years to come.

Some leaders in the sector commented on the announcement.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said: ""Rolling out more onshore wind is a no-brainer – it’s one of our cheapest technologies, quick to build, supports thousands of skilled jobs and can provide clean energy directly to the communities hosting it.

""After years of decline, we’re giving industry the tools to get building again, backing industrial renewal and secure, clean, homegrown energy through our Plan for Change.

Matthieu Hue, co-chair of the Onshore Wind Taskforce and CEO of EDF Power Solutions UK and Ireland, said: ""This strategy is focusing on overcoming barriers and challenges we face across the industry in the deployment of onshore wind while capturing the major socio-economic benefits it can bring to the environment and to local economies.

""Together we are forging a path forward for onshore wind in Great Britain, and we are committed to ensuring a successful implementation through a new Onshore Wind Council, which will oversee the execution of the strategy. This is a critical part of making Britain a clean energy superpower and delivering energy security.

James Robottom, head of Onshore Wind Deliveryat RenewableUK, said: ""Overturning the unpopular onshore wind ban, which deprived us of one of the quickest and cheapest technologies to build for a decade, was just the start. The hard work to make the most of this great opportunity to grow our economy and strengthen the UK’s energy security is now in full swing.

""This strategy sets an ambitious target to almost double the UK’s onshore wind capacity by the end of the decade as a key part of the government’s Clean Power by 2030 mission.

""The measures outlined will increase confidence among investors and developers, so that we can attract billions in private investment and create thousands of highly-skilled jobs and new supply chains all over the country. The strategy also sets out how people living near onshore wind farms will continue to see tailor-made community benefits through an updated Community Benefit Protocol for England, deciding for themselves the form that these benefits should take, to support and improve the lives of those in areas hosting onshore wind.""",https://www.insidermedia.com/uploads/news/images/generic-windmill-pix.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 13:23:33.827716

HR1, the one big beautiful bill act, is not just aggressive in scope, it's a direct and deeply strategic attack on the democratic architecture of the United States. It masquerades as administrative efficiency and fiscal responsibility but underneath it's a comprehensive blueprint for executive consolidation, ideological control and systemic disenfranchisement.

Here's the blunt truth: it's authoritarianism wrapped in bureaucratic language.

HR1 is what happens when an entire governing philosophy is based on dismantling government unless it serves the powerful. Every single chapter of this bill either centralizes executive authority, defunds regulatory agencies, strips away civil protections or shifts the burden of governance onto the most vulnerable people in society.

Expedited deportations without judicial review, that's not about efficiency, that's about eliminating constitutional oversight to build a machine that can operate in darkness. Cutting independent agencies like MedPAC or the Social Security Advisory Board, that's not reform, it's removing the brakes from a runaway train.

Silencing classrooms and ending DEI funding, it's a cultural purge designed to codify a narrow exclusionary worldview into national education policy. This isn't conservative governance, it's counterdemocratic engineering. It systemically dismantles the safeguards of a free society.

The institutions targeted by HR1 aren't arbitrary, they're specifically the ones that ensure transparency, protect minorities and maintain balance. It neuters the ability to audit tax sheets, neuters public health investments, slashes environmental and emission standards.

This bill defunds every agency that stands between corporate interests and profit. It creates loopholes wide enough to drive oligarchy through. It paves the road for a soft coup.

What's most dangerous is how legally sophisticated this document is. It's not sloppy, it's not amateur, it's meticulous. It builds the legal scaffolding for one party control. It shifts power away from oversight bodies and into the hands of agencies under direct presidential control. It establishes surveillance and enforcement norms that can easily be turned on. It dissolves the idea of nonpartisan truth, replacing it with politically approved doctrine especially in education, health and environmental science.

This isn't policy, it's a hostile restructuring of the republic, not done through tanks or violence but through legislative subversion.

The human cost will be catastrophic. Let's be crystal clear: people will suffer if this bill passes. Children will go hungry as food assistance is gutted and work requirements are tightened. Trans youth will lose access to care and their families will be criminalized for seeking it. Immigrants, many of them legal residents, will live in fear of removal or retaliation workers will face unregulated financial scams.

Higher pollution and fewer rights. The elderly and disabled will face a future without independent scrutiny of Medicare or Social Security sustainability. This bill treats social safety nets as disposable and human rights as negotiable.

Final verdict: this is the dress rehearsal for autocracy. If this bill becomes law it will not just change what the government does, it will change what the government is. It is a declaration that only certain people deserve protection, only certain truths can be spoken and only certain lives are worth investment. This is the type of legislation autocrats dream of legal sweeping ideologically rigid and dressed in the language of reform. If you believe in democracy pluralism justice or simply the idea that the government should not be a weapon, HR1 must be buried, not amended, not negotiated, defeated fully!",,N,,2025-07-05 12:19:45.492949

But only a small fraction of that total consists of battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
Our Take The EV market is entering a period of uncertainty.","The second quarter of 2025 painted a chaotic picture of the electric vehicle market in the United States. While General Motors enjoyed a breakout quarter, most other automakers, especially Tesla and Ford, stumbled hard. EV sales are now a mix of breakthroughs and breakdowns.

And all of this is happening under a White House that has turned decisively against green subsidies.

GM Breaks Away From the Pack

Despite a political environment hostile to clean energy, GM managed to deliver a stunning 111% increase in EV sales compared to the same quarter last year, moving 46,280 electric vehicles. The Detroit automaker’s investment in new models appears to be paying off.

Chevrolet Equinox EV sales soared 1,600% to 17,420 units.

GMC Hummer EV saw a 54% jump, hitting 4,508 units sold.

Cadillac Optiq and Cadillac Lyriq also posted strong gains.

GM now commands an estimated 13% share of the U.S. EV market and is emerging as a real contender to Tesla’s long-standing dominance. Many analysts attribute this rise to both product quality and a growing consumer backlash against Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s polarizing political activities.

Tesla Loses Momentum

‘Tesla, the market leader for years, is now clearly in retreat. The company delivered 384,122 vehicles globally in Q2, a 13.5% decline year-over-year. U.S. sales fell an estimated 16.7% to 125,000 units.

Industry experts say Tesla’s troubles go beyond competition. Musk’s involvement in Donald Trump’s administration, as head of the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has alienated many liberal and progressive buyers who once made up a key slice of Tesla’s customer base.

Ford’s EV Lineup Struggles Too

Ford’s EV division didn’t fare much better. The company’s electric vehicle sales dropped 31.4% in Q2, totaling just 16,438 units. Key models like the F-150 Lightning and the E-Transit van were down 26% and 88% respectively.

Even Ford’s best-performing EV, the Mustang Mach-E, saw a 20% decline. A stop-sale order during the quarter due to a safety recall involving over 317,000 vehicles further dented Ford’s EV momentum.

Toyota, Hyundai, and Kia: Mixed Signals

Toyota continues to gain ground but largely on the back of hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. It sold 320,817 “electrified vehicles” in Q2, up nearly 30% from a year ago. But only a small fraction of that total consists of battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

Hyundai and Kia reported steep declines

Hyundai Ioniq 5: Down 12%

Hyundai Ioniq 6: Down 8%

Kia EV6: Down 69%

Kia EV9: Down 79%

Both companies declined to share sales data for other electric models like the Kona EV and Niro EV.

A Mixed Picture Also for Disruptive EVs

The shifting landscape also extended to the newer, “disruptive” electric vehicle manufacturers. Rivian, known for its electric trucks and SUVs, delivered 10,661 units in the second quarter, marking a 22% decline from a year ago. While this drop might seem concerning, Rivian stated that its production was intentionally limited during this period to prepare for the launch of its 2026 model year vehicles later in July.

In contrast, luxury EV maker Lucid saw a notable increase in deliveries, soaring 38% to 3,309 units in Q2. This marks a new record for Lucid’s quarterly deliveries and its seventh consecutive quarter of increased handovers.

The Coming Surge: Tax Credit Cliff Approaches

The real wildcard in this turbulent market is federal policy. President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” signed into law on July 4, will end the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs on September 30. Those subsidies were cornerstones of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act and helped power EV adoption across the country.

The bill also slashes incentives for rooftop solar, heat pumps, and other green energy products, and removes fuel-efficiency penalties for automakers.

As the expiration date looms, many industry watchers expect a rush of purchases in Q3 as consumers scramble to lock in discounts. But after September?

That’s the real test.

Our Take

The EV market is entering a period of uncertainty. GM is rising. Tesla is falling. Ford is scrambling. And the federal government is pulling back its support. If Q2 was a mess, Q3 could be a feeding frenzy, and Q4 a reckoning.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2021/12/358332e424e140b1a7cba10430bdbe44.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 12:22:15.849528

Here, Nissan holds a critical advantage: its Nissan Leaf, the world's best-selling EV, saw a 103% surge in U.S. sales in Q1 2025.

Conclusion: A Sector in Transition Nissan's recall crisis is a stark reminder of the automotive industry's fragility.","The automotive sector is at a pivotal moment, balancing near-term disruptions from recalls and regulatory pressures against long-term structural shifts toward electric vehicles (EVs) and industry consolidation. Nowhere is this tension sharper than at Nissan, which faces a costly recall crisis that threatens its financial stability but also underscores why investors must look beyond the headlines to assess opportunities in automotive stocks.

The Short-Term Storm: Recalls, Costs, and Reputational Hits

Nissan's recent engine recall crisis—impacting over 480,000 vehicles in North America—has exposed vulnerabilities in its quality control and supply chain. The faulty bearings in its VC-Turbo engines, which risked engine failure and fires, prompted a recall costing up to $500 million, a significant burden for a company already grappling with a $11 billion loss from Renault's accounting scandal. Add to this declining U.S. sales (e.g., a 14% drop for the Rogue SUV) and regulatory scrutiny, including potential fines under the EU's 2026 Automotive Safety Act, and the short-term outlook is grim.

Investors have already priced in these risks. Nissan's shares have underperformed peers like Toyota and Honda by over 15% year-to-date, reflecting skepticism about its ability to manage costs and restore consumer trust. Meanwhile, competitors like Toyota (which saw a 0.1% rise in U.S. sales in June 2025) and General Motors (gaining EV market share to 14.4%) are capitalizing on Nissan's missteps.

The Long-Term Horizon: EV Adoption and Industry Consolidation

Yet beneath the chaos lies a structural story. The automotive sector is undergoing a $1.2 trillion EV revolution, with global EV sales expected to hit 17 million units in 2024, up 25% year-on-year. Here, Nissan holds a critical advantage: its Nissan Leaf, the world's best-selling EV, saw a 103% surge in U.S. sales in Q1 2025. This momentum, combined with its all-new Murano crossover and price cuts for the Rogue, signals a strategic pivot toward affordability and electrification.

The broader industry is also consolidating to meet EV challenges. The Honda-Nissan-Mitsubishi merger, set to finalize by 2026, aims to create a $180 billion entity with 8 million annual vehicle production capacity. This merger would pool R&D resources, cut costs (e.g., $3 billion in synergies by 2030), and accelerate EV innovation—a lifeline for Nissan, which has lagged in hybrid and battery technology.

Supplier Resilience: A Hidden Catalyst for Recovery

While Nissan's stock falters, suppliers with robust quality control and diversified supply chains are thriving. Companies like NSK (bearing manufacturer) and Panasonic (EV battery partner) have avoided recall fallout by adopting AI-driven defect detection and modular manufacturing. These suppliers are now critical to Nissan's recovery, as well as Toyota and Honda's dominance in hybrid and EV markets.

Investment Strategy: Navigating the Crossroads

Avoid Nissan's stock unless the merger succeeds. Its near-term risks—recall costs, regulatory fines, and declining sales—outweigh its EV potential. However, the merger's success could unlock value by 2030, making it a long-term bet for patient investors.

Opt for resilient competitors. Toyota's conservative balance sheet (debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3x) and $6.8 billion U.S. EV investment make it a safer play. Honda's undervalued P/B ratio (1.1x) and its leadership in the merger add further appeal.

Look to suppliers. Companies like LG Energy Solution (partner to Honda and GM) and BYD (dominating global EV markets) offer exposure to EV growth without the volatility of automaker stocks.

Conclusion: A Sector in Transition

Nissan's recall crisis is a stark reminder of the automotive industry's fragility. But it also highlights the sector's resilience and the transformative power of EVs and consolidation. Investors who focus on companies with strong balance sheets, EV leadership, and supplier partnerships will be best positioned to navigate this transition. For now, the road ahead is bumpy, but the destination—electric, consolidated, and profitable—is clear.",,N,,2025-07-05 13:23:14.469838

“North Dakotans are the ones who are building the energy future of the United States,” Vance said.
Vance said the bill funds job training and newborn savings accounts, reduces federal spending and reallocates existing funds toward border security.
The trip highlights the strategy of aligning federal legislation with energy-producing states like North Dakota, he said.
Vance did not confirm reports that he would be visiting the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in Medora during his visit to the state, though he did express excitement about visiting southwestern North Dakota for the first time.","DICKINSON — Vice President JD Vance made his first visit to North Dakota on Friday, stepping off Air Force Two during a private Independence Day stop to speak with media about the impacts of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” for North Dakotans.

“One of the things I know very, very personally, growing up in a part of the country that sometimes gets ignored and left behind, is that a lot of times, states like this don’t get as much attention from national leadership,” he said at the Dickinson Theodore Roosevelt Regional Airport. “So I thought, what better day than the Fourth of July to come to North Dakota and show people we care about them, we’re rooting for them.”

He used the stop to promote the Republican-backed bill passed by Congress on Thursday, July 3, and expected to be signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. The legislation extends Trump-era tax cuts, increases the standard deduction, offers new business incentives, and includes substantial spending and policy changes across health, energy and infrastructure.

“North Dakotans are the ones who are building the energy future of the United States,” Vance said. “There are so many provisions in this bill that are going to make it easier to invest in oil and gas drilling here in the United States.”

He framed the bill as a rollback of “Biden-era regulations” and said it is designed to boost traditional energy sectors. Among its energy provisions, Vance highlighted funding for next-generation data centers powered by on-site plants — a move he said would strengthen American competitiveness in artificial intelligence and the digital economy.

Vance pointed to China’s rapidly growing power generation as a warning. In recent years, China has more than doubled its electricity production, while U.S. output has remained relatively flat. That, he said, could pose a strategic disadvantage as demand for data and AI power soars.

The bill also includes a $50 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program over five years aimed at stabilizing rural health care, as well as expanded telehealth and hospital reimbursements. Advocates say this may cushion potential coverage losses from Medicaid reforms, though critics warn that rural hospitals may still face funding gaps.

Vance said the bill funds job training and newborn savings accounts, reduces federal spending and reallocates existing funds toward border security. He framed it as a “correction” to what he called flawed policies under the previous administration.

On artificial intelligence, he acknowledged concerns about job displacement and expressed confidence that if infrastructure and innovation are managed domestically, the U.S. could see broader employment growth and less of a foreign-controlled future of the industry.

By visiting Dickinson — an energy hub in a state that produces nearly 20% of U.S. oil — on Independence Day, Vance said he wanted to emphasize the administration’s effort to connect national policy to local impact. The trip highlights the strategy of aligning federal legislation with energy-producing states like North Dakota, he said.

Democrats uniformly opposed the bill, while all but two House Republicans supported it.

This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist's weekly newsletter here.

“This bill will leave America a far crueler and weaker place,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen, in a statement. It “races the United States and the world toward climate catastrophe, ending support for renewable energy that is absolutely vital to avert worst-case climate scenarios.”

The so-called Big Beautiful Bill has now been approved by both chambers of Congress; all it needs now is Trump’s signature before it can become law. Trump is expected to sign it during an evening ceremony on July 4, Independence Day, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

One of Republicans’ biggest victories in the bill is the extension of deep tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, which are estimated to cost the country more than $4 trillion over 10 years. The legislation also directs roughly $325 billion to the military and to border security, while cutting nearly $1 trillion in funding for Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that covers medical costs for lower-income people.

To pay for the tax breaks, the bill sunsets clean energy tax credits that were put in place by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, making wind and solar projects ineligible unless they start construction before July 2026 or are placed in service by 2027. It also imposes an expedited phaseout of consumer tax credits for new and used electric vehicles — by September 30 this year instead of by 2032. Green groups described the legislation as “historically ruinous” and “a self-inflicted tragedy for our country.”

The IRA’s tax credits and additional incentives for green energy from the bipartisan infrastructure act, also passed under former president Joe Biden, were projected to reduce the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent by 2030. Combined with additional action from states, cities, and private companies, they could have put the U.S. on track to meet the country’s emissions reduction target under the United Nations Paris Agreement.

Once Trump signs the megabill, however, the U.S. will have no federal plan to address the climate crisis.

“Every lawmaker who voted for this cynical measure chose tax cuts for the wealthiest over Americans’ health, pocketbooks, public lands, and waters — and a safe climate. They should be ashamed,” said Manish Bapna, president of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement.

Agriculture experts have also objected to Trump’s policy bill, which removes the requirement that unobligated climate-targeted funds from the IRA be funneled toward climate-specific projects — in part so they can be directed toward programs under the current farm bill, an omnibus bill for food and agriculture that the federal government renews every five to six years. The Trump megabill seeks to increase subsidies to commodity farms by about $50 billion.

The final version of the bill doesn’t include a proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands; this was dropped following outcry from the public and some conservation-minded GOP lawmakers. It also lacks stringent limits on the use of Chinese components in renewable energy projects that were proposed in an earlier version of the bill. Some Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate voted for the legislation in exchange for carveouts in their states, like reduced work requirements for food stamps and less severe health care cuts.

In the Thursday House vote, only two Republicans broke with their party to vote against Trump’s megabill: Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who opposes measures that would increase the federal deficit, and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who had hesitated to support cuts to Medicaid.

All Democrats voted against the bill. Immediately preceding the House vote, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York railed against the policy in a record-breaking 8-hour-and-45-minute House floor speech invoking scripture: “Our job is to stand up for the poor, the sick, and the afflicted,” he said.

Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus have promised to hold Republicans accountable. More than three dozen of its members have said they’ll hold “Accountability Summer” events lambasting Republican lawmakers who supported the bill. “As Democrats, we must make sure they never live that down,” the group’s chair, Greg Casar, a Democrat of Texas, said in a statement.

Similarly, Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat for Hawaiʻi, told The New York Times that his party should use the megabill’s spending cuts as a cudgel against Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections: “Our job is to point out, when kids get less to eat, when rural hospitals shutter, when the price of electricity goes up, that this is because of what your Republican elected official did,” he said.

Auto loan interest deduction The final piece impacting the U.S. truck market auto loan interest deduction.","Trump’s tax bill was signed into law and it has three significant ways it will change the U.S. truck market.

Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill

The bill was signed into law on July 4, 2025 and includes several changes to the tax code including several significant changes for the automotive market.

These changes will significantly impact everything from consumer buying, automaker’s capital investments and tax savings for consumers.

These aren’t future changes either, they take effect now or in the coming months.

CAFE fines ended

The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, signed into law in 1975, was in response to the Iran Oil crisis. This program was aimed at improving fuel economy, reducing dependence on foreign oil and thereby improving national security.

A key part of the program was the use of fines to make automakers comply with higher fuel economy standards.

“These proposed changes effectively gut the popular CAFE program, turning it into nothing more than an accounting requirement with no teeth,” Chris Harto, senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports, said in a statement when the Senate text was originally released. “Without an enforcement mechanism, many automakers are likely to continue to leave proven, popular, and cost effective technologies sitting and gathering dust on the shelf, rather than deploying them to save consumers money at the pump.”

The program has faced criticism in recent years with consumers questioning how far automakers have been forced to go with technology they see as increasingly unreliable. Trucks, specifically, have never been more fuel efficient.

Electric vehicle credit ending

First is the change in the EV credit ending on September 30, 2025.

This EV credit provided a credit of $7,500 when purchasing a new EV and $4,000 for used EVs. Automakers and dealers had requested a longer timeframe to end the credit.

Dealers stated they had 14,000 vehicles on lots and this credit is a primary buying reason for EV shoppers.

Plus, automakers have pledged billions, if not trillions of dollars in new plant construction and jobs for future EV vehicles.

Without this EV credit, analysts see the EV market seeing a significant downturn.

New EV startups like Scout and Amazon-backed Slate Auto could face significant issues getting their business going.

Auto loan interest deduction

The final piece impacting the U.S. truck market auto loan interest deduction. This is up to $10,000 of loan interest that can be deducted if the vehicle meets certain requirements.

It starts with the 2025 to 2028 tax year for qualified taxpayers and it is an “above-the-line” deduction meaning even those who take the standard deduction and don’t itemize will get the tax benefit.

The requirements are:

Eligible vehicles must be assembled in the U.S.

Manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways

Car, minivan, van, sport utility vehicle, pickup truck or motorcycle

Vehicle must have a gross vehicle weight rating of under 14,000 pounds

Does not apply to a commercial vehicle

According to the New York Times, the only buyers who could receive the maximum deduction are those with new car loans of $110,000 or higher. The publication quoted Jonathan Smoke, an economist at market research firm Cox Automotive, who said that just one percent of loans in the U.S. are over that mark.

What does this mean for the truck market? Full-size trucks from mid-grade to so-called luxury truck buyers will get a tax benefit. It will be more beneficial for some buyers to buy new versus buying slightly used for the tax savings if it puts them in a lower tax brackets. This will be especially the case with the higher-dollar trucks. Those trucks are built in the U.S.

The lower-end trucks are often the ones built in Mexico and the lower price will make them not matter to this new bill.

Our take

It is likely people will read this article and think automakers will immediately end things like cylinder deactivation, kill turbocharged engines, direct injection, etc… And Dodge and Ram will Hellcat everything again. It is hard to see some of those immediate changes.

For starters, U.S. Presidential terms are short compared to automaker’s plans. And second, new truck sales are consistently doing well for automakers with the new technologies. Third, they use these technologies globally in larger markets like China that comply with Euro 6 emissions standards.

As with any legislation, the unintended consequences is always the more interesting things to watch play out. What will happen in the next year? Grab your popcorn.",https://pickuptrucktalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f-150-lightning_tow_boat-copy.webp,N,,2025-07-05 13:24:58.081630

Homeowners who have used EnergySage's tools and solar marketplace to compare solar quotes have saved up to $10,000 on solar projects.","A new SolarReviews study using Zillow data on recently sold homes in 2025 found that homes with solar panels sell for 6.9% more than non-solar homes. This profit translates to about $25,000 more in average house sale prices.

Six years prior, Zillow conducted a similar study comparing the prices of solar homes to non-solar homes. The online marketplace found that solar homes outpriced non-solar homes at a rate of 4.1%, or about an average of $10,000 more.

Solar is a home upgrade that will generally increase your home's value, especially as property values increase over time.

It's also one of the best ways to become energy-independent and save money on home energy costs. EnergySage estimates that homeowners will save about $50,000 on energy costs over the lifespan of a solar system, which is about 25 years.

The math, maths.

The average cost of solar is between $17,900 and $23,600, with the national average at $20,948, according to a previous report by The Cool Down.

With federal solar tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act — which may not be available forever due to Congress' recent pushes to repeal it — homeowners can still save up to 30% off the cost of a qualified home solar system if installed before the end of the year.

Even at the higher end of the range for solar installations, homeowners will still experience an automatic profit or return on investment in the increased home value. Remember, Zillow data calculates an average higher home value price of about $25,000 for solar homes compared to non-solar homes.

Factoring in energy savings the solar system provides — which will reduce the cost of energy to as low as free — homeowners will likely net positive on owning and installing home solar, while helping to reduce household carbon output.

Now may be a prime time to install solar before the federal tax incentives disappear.

Using EnergySage's free mapping tool, homeowners can find additional relevant state and local solar incentives to save even more on solar installation. Homeowners who have used EnergySage's tools and solar marketplace to compare solar quotes have saved up to $10,000 on solar projects.

""Properties that come equipped with solar panels often catch the eye of buyers and tend to sell more quickly,"" said Brett Johnson, owner of real estate consulting company New Era Home Buyers, per SolarReviews.

Warm air holds more moisture than cool air, and as temperatures rise, storms can produce bigger downpours. When met on the ground with outdated infrastructure or inadequate warning systems, the results can be catastrophic.

These were the ingredients for tragedy in Texas, a state that is well acquainted with weather extremes of all kinds: high heat and deep cold, deluges and droughts, tornadoes hurricanes, hail and snow. Indeed, the Hill Country, the part of the state where the Guadalupe River swelled on Friday, is sometimes called “flash flood alley” for how at risk it is to seemingly out-of-nowhere surges of water.

Humid air blows into the area from two main sources, the Gulf of Mexico and the tropical Pacific Ocean. When this air collides with cool air drifting down across the Great Plains, severe storms can erupt. The hilly terrain and steep canyons quickly funnel the rain into river valleys, transforming lazy streams into roaring cascades.

In parts of Texas that were flooded on Friday, the quantities of rain that poured down in a six-hour stretch were so great that they had less than a tenth of 1 percent chance of falling there in any given year, according to data analyzed by Russ Schumacher, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University.

The Guadalupe River rose from three feet to 34 feet in about 90 minutes, according to data from a river gauge near the town of Comfort, Texas. The volume of water exploded from 95 cubic feet per second to 166,000 cubic feet per second.

And the warming climate is creating the conditions in Texas for more of these sharp, deadly deluges.

In the eastern part of the state, the number of days per year with at least two inches of rain or snow has increased by 20 percent since 1900, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment, the federal government’s flagship report on how global warming is affecting the United States. Across Texas, the intensity of extreme rain could increase another 10 percent by 2036, according to a report last year by John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist.

To understand patterns of heavy rain at a more local level, communities and officials rely on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency has for decades published nationwide estimates of the probabilities of various precipitation events — that is, a certain number of inches falling in a particular location over a given amount of time, from five minutes to 24 hours to 60 days.

Engineers use NOAA’s estimates to design storm drains and culverts. City planners use them to guide development and regulations in flood-prone areas.

NOAA’s next updates to the estimates are scheduled to be released starting next year. For the first time, they are expected to include projections of how extreme precipitation will evolve as the climate changes, in order to help officials plan further ahead.

But in recent months, the Trump administration has cut staff at the agency and at the National Weather Service, which sits within NOAA. The administration has also dismissed the hundreds of experts who had been compiling the next edition of the National Climate Assessment, which was scheduled to come out in 2028. And it is proposing deep cuts to NOAA’s 2026 budget, including eliminating the office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which conducts and coordinates climate research.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/05/multimedia/05cli-texasflood-gmpc/05cli-texasflood-gmpc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 11:03:44.747105

Sign up for their newsletter here.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed 139 employees on administrative leave Thursday, an agency spokesperson confirmed, after they signed a “Stand Up for Science” petition using their official titles and EPA positions.

The affected employees received an email, shared with Inside Climate News, informing them that they are on leave through July 17, pending an investigation into whether they used work time or resources when signing the petition.

The email emphasizes that “this is not a disciplinary action.”

One employee, who asked not to be named, said they signed the petition “on a Sunday on my own device.”

“I’d be shocked if anyone used work resources,” the employee went on. “We’ve taken ethics training and are aware of the law.”

While the employees are on leave, they are prohibited from using government equipment, including cell phones, logging into government-issued computers, contacting any EPA employees for access to information and performing any official EPA duties.

An EPA spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency “has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November.”

The EPA also alleged that the petition contains misleading information, but did not specify what is incorrect.

The petition, addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and members of Congress, is a “declaration of dissent” with the administration’s policies, “including those that undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

“Since the Agency’s founding in 1970, EPA has accomplished this mission by leveraging science, funding, and expert staff in service to the American people,” the petition reads. “Today, we stand together in dissent against the current administration’s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise.”

More than 200 EPA employees, including retirees, signed the petition, some of them only by initials. The document criticizes the agency for “undermining the public trust” by issuing misleading statements in press releases, such as referring to EPA grants as “green slush funds” and praising “clean coal as beautiful.”

The petition also accuses the administration of “ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters,” most notably regarding asbestos, mercury and greenhouse gases.

Health-based regulatory standards are being repealed or reconsidered, including drinking water limits for four PFAS “forever chemicals” that cause cancer.

“The decisions of the current administration frequently contradict the peer-reviewed research and recommendations of Agency experts. Such contradiction undermines EPA’s reputation as a trusted scientific authority. Make no mistake: your actions endanger public health and erode scientific progress—not only in America—but around the world.”

Signatories also lambasted the EPA for reversing progress on environmental justice, including the cancellation of billions of grant dollars to underserved communities and the removal of EJScreen, a mapping analysis tool that allowed the public to see pollution sources, neighborhood demographics and health data.

The petition also opposes the dismantling of the Office of Research and Development, whose work forms the scientific basis for federal rulemaking.

Nicole Cantello is president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Union Local 704, and leader of AFGE Council 238, a nationwide union that represents over 8,000 EPA employees.

She said the EPA’s allegations are baseless.

“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like,” Cantello said. “Now the Trump administration is retaliating against them.”

Cantello said the union will fight for the employees on several legal grounds, including First Amendment protections and employment contractual rights. “We’ll be using all of them to defend our people,” she said.

Matthew Tejada, the former director of the EPA’s environmental justice program and currently senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the Trump administration for going after the EPA employees who signed the letter.

These civil servants, he said, were “totally within their rights” to speak out. “This is a public declaration by those employees that they continue to fight to do their jobs to help people across this country live healthier, safer, more prosperous lives,” Tejada said.

Tejada emphasized that the individuals involved were not working in coordination with advocacy groups, but acting independently in defense of the agency’s mission and the public interest.

He called the administration’s reaction “another indication that this administration is unique in modern times for having zero regard for the Constitution, for protecting and supporting the people of the United States.”

In south-central China, rare earth mines have poisoned dozens of once-green valleys and left hillsides stripped to barren red clay.
Achieving dominance in rare earths came with a heavy cost for China, which largely tolerated severe environmental damage for many years.

This has given China’s government near complete control over a critical choke point in global trade.

But for decades in northern China, toxic sludge from rare earth processing has been dumped into a four-square-mile artificial lake. In south-central China, rare earth mines have poisoned dozens of once-green valleys and left hillsides stripped to barren red clay.

Achieving dominance in rare earths came with a heavy cost for China, which largely tolerated severe environmental damage for many years. The industrialized world, by contrast, had tighter regulations and stopped accepting even limited environmental harm from the industry as far back as the 1990s, when rare earth mines and processing centers closed elsewhere.

In China, the worst damage occurred in and around Baotou, a flat, industrial city of two million people in China’s Inner Mongolia, on the southern edge of the Gobi Desert. Baotou calls itself the world capital of the rare earth industry, but the city and its people bear the scars from decades of poorly regulated rare earths production.

An artificial lake of sludge known as the Weikuang Dam, four square miles in size, holds the waste left over after metals are extracted from mined ore. During the winter and spring, the sludge dries out. The dust that then blows off the lake is contaminated with lead, cadmium and other heavy metals, including traces of radioactive thorium, according to technical papers by Chinese scholars.

During the summer rainy season, the sludge becomes coated with a layer of water that mixes with poisons and thorium. This dangerous mix seeps into the groundwater underneath the lake.

Government cleanup efforts have helped mitigate some health and safety risks in the industry. But Chinese academics and other experts have warned that environmental damage remains after years of poor practices and lax oversight.

“The closer to the tailings lake, the more serious the pollution and the higher the environmental and ecological risk,” said scholars at the Inner Mongolia University of Science and Technology in a research paper in January.

Similarly, researchers at the elite Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, which is a government ministry, warned in a technical paper last year about “serious air and tailings pond pollution” in the Baotou area.

The Baotou Radiation Environment Management Office warned in 2009 that at the Bayan Obo iron ore and rare earths mine, 80 miles north of the city in the Gobi Desert, radioactive thorium was being “discharged into the environment in the form of waste slag, wastewater and dust.” In 2003, another paper found intellectual development disorders among children in Baotou affected by rare earths industry pollution, and a paper in 2017 found that children in Baotou still had potentially harmful levels of rare earths in their urine.

Until a crackdown in 2010 and 2011, many illegal mines in south-central China spilled acid and ammonia into streams, poisoning rice fields.

China’s leaders have been working for over a decade to clean up the country’s rare earth industry, at a cost running into the billions of dollars.

“Excessive rare earth mining has resulted in landslides, clogged rivers, environmental pollution emergencies and even major accidents and disasters, causing great damage to people’s safety and health and the ecological environment,” China’s cabinet wrote in 2012 in a comprehensive report on the industry’s pollution.

During a visit I made in 2010 to the Baotou tailings lake, a berm, little more than a high pile of earth, lay around its perimeter to contain the sludge. Rare earth refineries, then along the north side of the lake, were crude facilities with workers stirring big vats by hand. A nearby residential community had high rates of pollution-related health problems, according to Chinese experts at the time. Baotou itself was shrouded with smog, and the air had an acrid, faintly metallic taste.

Some progress since then is visible. During a return visit in early June, it was clear that the berm had been reinforced with stones. And outside the berm was a concrete-walled moat that could catch leaks from the berm.

The residential community had been moved to a less polluted area of the city. Replacing it were steel-walled industrial sheds. Few people were around. The smog had disappeared, and the air tasted clean.

Dust from the lake is a more difficult problem to resolve. In processing rare earths, acid is used to pry apart the chemical envelope that contains them in nature. Radioactive thorium is almost always released. In Baotou, it was simply dumped into the lake for decades instead of being stored in special repositories, as required in the West.

The Inner Mongolia government announced in 2015 that refineries had begun treating their waste before discharging it into the lake, but did not specify how the thorium was handled.

In the days of the Soviet Union, thorium dust blew across Scandinavia from a tailings pond at a rare earth processing facility in Estonia. Soon after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, the European Union spent close to 1 billion euros to build an adjacent pit with 10-foot-thick concrete walls, move the sludge into it and then cover it with 30 feet of dirt.

The Weikuang Dam has vastly more sludge because the effluent from rare earth processing is mixed into an enormous volume of material from iron ore processing. Any effort to move and store the sludge would be a logistical challenge, and no attempt to do so was visible when I visited in June.

But even as other cleanup measures continue, the Chinese authorities have increasingly censored discussions of rare earth industry pollution. State media reported a decade ago that thousands of acres of grasslands near Baotou had been closed to livestock grazing after sheep and goats had been fatally poisoned by dust from the rare earth industry. But practically no mention of that incident can be found online now inside China.

Oversight of the rare earth industry in Baotou is complicated. Pollution regulation in China is mainly the responsibility of provincial governments — in this case, the government of Inner Mongolia.

But the same provincial government also owns Baogang Group, a mining and chemicals giant that runs the Bayan Obo mine, the steel mills and most of the rare earth refineries in Baotou. Baogang has been a pillar of China’s military-industrial complex since Mao. The Baotou Museum celebrates that Baogang made much of the steel for China’s tanks and artillery in the 1950s.

During my trip to Baotou in early June, two colleagues and I were stopped on a public road by eight carloads of police officers and Baogang security guards and questioned. We were put in the back of a police cruiser and later taken to a guardroom at Baogang’s headquarters. With 21 carloads of police officers and local officials outside, we were held for two hours and questioned further before being released and told that the Weikuang Dam was “a business secret of the Baogang Group.”

A woman there who said she was with Baogang’s rare earth subsidiary, but did not provide her name, said that Baogang declined to comment.

There were also modest signs of environmental improvement during a visit in April to the main valley producing heavy rare earths near Longnan.

In a world of energy uncertainty, U.S. natural gas offers a rare combination of growth, stability, and diversification—a divergence worth betting on.","The energy sector's volatility has long been dominated by crude oil's swings, but a quieter revolution is unfolding in natural gas. As global industrialization accelerates and LNG export infrastructure comes online, U.S. natural gas is emerging as a high-potential investment class, insulated from crude oil's price whiplash. Structural demand shifts, production resilience, and strategic storage dynamics are aligning to create a compelling opportunity.

Structural Demand: Fueling the Global Industrial Surge

Global industrialization is a relentless force. Asia's manufacturing boom, Europe's post-pandemic recovery, and North America's energy-intensive industries all rely on affordable, reliable energy. Natural gas, cleaner than coal and more flexible than renewables, is the linchpin. The EIA forecasts U.S. natural gas consumption to rise to 91 Bcf/d in 2025, up from 90 Bcf/d in 2024, driven by:

- Industrial growth: Steel, chemicals, and plastics production in the U.S. and abroad.

- LNG exports: Expected to hit 16 Bcf/d by 2026, up from 12.6 Bcf/d in 2024, as new projects like Venture Global's Plaquemines and Cheniere's Corpus Christi Stage 3 come online.

- Power sector shifts: While coal and renewables offset some gas demand, gas remains a critical baseload fuel, especially in regions like Texas and the Northeast.

Production Leverage: Efficiency Overhead

Despite a 34-rig drop in the Gulf of Mexico rig count since 2024, U.S. natural gas production remains robust. The EIA projects 106 Bcf/d in both 2025 and 2026, sustained by:

- Shale productivity: Permian and Haynesville basins saw 6.6%–7.0% year-over-year productivity gains in early 2025, thanks to optimized drilling and completion techniques.

- Gulf of Mexico projects: New fields like Shenandoah (120,000 b/d oil equivalent) and Whale (85,000 b/d) are offsetting declines in aging wells. Subsea tiebacks (e.g., Silvertip Phase 3) will add 308,000 Bcf/d by 2026.

- Drilled-but-uncompleted (DUC) wells: Operators are activating DUCs to balance rig cuts, ensuring steady supply without over-investment.

Storage Dynamics: The Price Catalyst

Natural gas inventories are a critical barometer. As of June 2025, working gas stocks stood at 2,898 Bcf, 7% above the five-year average but 6% below 2024 levels. The EIA warns that inventories may dip below the five-year average by October, tightening supply and pushing prices higher. Key drivers include:

- Summer demand peaks: Cooling-degree days (CDD) in June 2025 drove record power-sector gas consumption, with prices spiking to $4.30/MMBtu in Q3 2025.

- Export bottlenecks: LNG facilities like Golden Pass are nearing capacity, but delays in infrastructure upgrades could strain supply.

- Hurricane risk: A 17-storm 2025 Atlantic hurricane season threatens Gulf production, adding a premium to prices.

Investment Playbook: Where to Stake Your Claims

LNG Exporters: Companies like Cheniere Energy (LNG) and Venture Global (VGAS) benefit directly from rising export volumes. Their terminals are contracted long-term with Asian and European buyers, offering steady cash flows.

Gulf of Mexico Operators: Firms like Devon Energy (DVN) and EOG Resources (EOG) with Gulf exposure gain from high-margin offshore projects.

Storage and Infrastructure: Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) and Williams Companies (WMB) profit from storage bottlenecks and pipeline demand.

Natural Gas ETFs: United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) tracks spot prices, while Global X Natural Gas ETF (GAS) offers diversified exposure.

The Bottom Line: Buy the Gas, Not the Noise

U.S. natural gas is a structural play with asymmetric upside. While crude oil faces macroeconomic headwinds, gas demand is underpinned by industrialization, LNG contracts, and seasonal storage dynamics. With prices projected to climb to $4.88/MMBtu by 2026, investors should consider allocations to gas-focused equities and ETFs. The volatility of oil may persist, but gas is quietly becoming the energy sector's steady hand.

India’s battery manufacturing sector is still in its nascent stage.
These partnerships can help secure lithium supply and support India’s battery manufacturing.
Addressing raw material gaps through global tie-ups, enhancing refining & processing capacities, and advanced battery recycling can cut import dependence.
Well-structured regulations, industry-government collaboration, and smooth execution, India can shift from assembly to value addition and emerge as a global leader in sustainable battery manufacturing.","In light of this, the 2025 Union Budget removed Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on 28 capital goods used in mobile battery manufacturing, encouraging local output for consumer electronics. As part of a broader strategy since the July 2024 Budget, India had already nullified BCD on 25 critical minerals. The 2025 Union Budget’s exemptions on cobalt powder, LiB scrap, lead, zinc, and 12 other critical minerals aim to strengthen sourcing of affordable critical mineral feedstock at competitive price, strengthen domestic battery production, and cut import dependence.

Removing BCD on critical minerals lowers costs, attracts investment in refining and recycling, and strengthens India’s battery supply chain for global competitiveness. However, this is a long-term journey, requiring approximately five to six years to rapidly scale up domestic production, enhance recycling capacities and strengthen R&D investments. This effort is key to cutting imports and building a resilient circular economy.

India’s battery manufacturing sector is still in its nascent stage. LiBs, essential for powering consumer electronics, have become the dominant technology due to their high energy density and longer lifespan. India’s rising LiB demand highlights its import dependence due to limited local manufacturing. Without strong policy support and industrial growth, reliance on countries like China, South Korea, and Japan may threaten long-term energy security and economic resilience.

Currently, China dominates the global LiB market manufacturing, accounting for 77% of worldwide cell capacity and 80% of raw material refining. To counter China’s dominance and boost local capacity, India has launched initiatives like Make in India for self-reliant manufacturing, the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) for critical mineral supply, and a PLI Scheme for Critical Minerals to promote recycling and advanced technologies—together strengthening domestic industry and accelerating manufacturing.

Despite efforts to boost domestic manufacturing, securing raw material supply chains remains urgent. Under NCMM, India may form strategic partnerships with friendly nations like Australia and Chile having the largest lithium reserves to bridge the raw material gap.

India and Australia have already committed $43.2 million for joint initiatives between Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Indian partners, fostering collaboration in critical minerals research and technology development. India and Chile share a long-standing trade relationship, formalized by a 2005 Framework Agreement and a Preferential Trade Agreement to boost bilateral trade, including minerals and energy. These partnerships can help secure lithium supply and support India’s battery manufacturing. However, India must also invest in refining and processing to cut import dependence.

Another key hurdle to India’s LiB growth is low R&D investment. India’s Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) across sectors stands at just 0.64% of GDP, significantly lower than China (2.4%) and the US (3.4%). With low overall GERD, battery R&D investment remains limited, hindering innovation. To compete globally, India must strengthen multi-institutional R&D collaborations. The ministry of electronics and IT had taken an initiative to establish a Centre of Excellence on Rechargeable Battery Technology at Centre for Materials for Electronics Technology, Pune to support SMEs the R&D needs on material, machine and process of advanced chemistry cell including cathode and anode materials of various rechargeable batteries like Li-ion, sodium ion, solid state Li-ion and flexible batteries. Scaling more public-private partnerships can boost local IP and aid industry. India should explore alternative chemistries like sodium-ion, sodium-sulphur, metal-air, redox flow, and lithium-metal—to reduce reliance on vulnerable critical mineral supply chains.

Efforts may be focused on building a strong recycling framework and boosting R&D via support labs and start-up incubators can help lower costs and reduce import dependence. However, globally, the present recycling rate of Ni, Co and Li are merely 60%, 32%, and 0.5% respectively, which is due to challenging reverse logistics of collecting end-of-life batteries and lack of profitable recycling technologies with limited volume. Recycling and refining industries must adopt innovative technologies to make metal extraction more profitable.

At the same time, the emphasis on using domestically recycled materials under the Battery Waste Management Rules,2022(BWMR) though challenging, offers a chance to boost India’s self-sufficiency in critical materials. The regulation allows the targets to be met using any battery component, including non-critical materials like aluminum and plastics, rather than focusing on reclaiming lithium, cobalt, or nickel. Given the complexities, realistic timelines are key to avoid supply chain disruptions. While South Korea took over two decades to set recycled content guidelines after starting LiB production, India is aiming to introduce such regulations within just three years of commercial-scale manufacturing—highlighting the need for a more pragmatic timeline. India’s recycling infrastructure is underdeveloped, with most end-of-life LiBs poorly processed in the informal sector, causing major material losses. The current pace of progress is insufficient, making it imperative to accelerate domestic LiB manufacturing and recycling capacities in the next five to six years to meet BWMR guidelines and reduce dependency on external supply chains.

Battery recycling can reduce India’s reliance on raw material imports by recovering lithium, cobalt, and nickel from end-of-life LiBs for reuse in battery production. Unlike China, which is currently the only market with significant LiB recycling infrastructure, India’s ecosystem is deterred by limited investment and unorganised battery waste management.

As India moves towards becoming a global leader in consumer electronics, ensuring a stable and sustainable supply of LiBs will be critical. Creating reserves of recycled critical minerals under NCMM, can help achieve true Atmanirbharta. India is at a crucial juncture in its journey toward self-sufficiency in LiB manufacturing, a sector vital for clean energy, digital growth, and industrial expansion. While schemes like PLI, customs duty cuts, and NCMM offer policy momentum, building a resilient battery ecosystem needs scaled-up production, secure supply chains, and stronger R&D. Addressing raw material gaps through global tie-ups, enhancing refining & processing capacities, and advanced battery recycling can cut import dependence. Multi-institutional R&D, alternative chemistries, and phased recycling mandates will enable a circular economy. Well-structured regulations, industry-government collaboration, and smooth execution, India can shift from assembly to value addition and emerge as a global leader in sustainable battery manufacturing.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/05/1600x900/Employees-guide-finished-corrugated-steel-roofing-_1751311865792_1751713771407.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 10:03:42.034211

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed 139 employees on administrative leave Thursday, an agency spokesperson confirmed, after they signed a “Stand Up for Science” petition using their official titles and EPA positions.

The affected employees received an email, shared with Inside Climate News, informing them that they are on leave through July 17, pending an investigation into whether they used work time or resources when signing the petition.

The email emphasizes that “this is not a disciplinary action.”

One employee, who asked not to be named, said they signed the petition “on a Sunday on my own device.”

“I’d be shocked if anyone used work resources,” the employee went on. “We’ve taken ethics training and are aware of the law.”

While the employees are on leave, they are prohibited from using government equipment, including cell phones, logging into government-issued computers, contacting any EPA employees for access to information and performing any official EPA duties.

An EPA spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency “has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November.”

The EPA also alleged that the petition contains misleading information, but did not specify what is incorrect.

The petition, addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and members of Congress, is a “declaration of dissent” with the administration’s policies, “including those that undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

“Since the Agency’s founding in 1970, EPA has accomplished this mission by leveraging science, funding, and expert staff in service to the American people,” the petition reads. “Today, we stand together in dissent against the current administration’s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise.”

More than 200 EPA employees, including retirees, signed the petition, some of them only by initials. The document criticizes the agency for “undermining the public trust” by issuing misleading statements in press releases, such as referring to EPA grants as “green slush funds” and praising “clean coal as beautiful.”

The petition also accuses the administration of “ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters,” most notably regarding asbestos, mercury and greenhouse gases.

Health-based regulatory standards are being repealed or reconsidered, including drinking water limits for four PFAS “forever chemicals” that cause cancer.

“The decisions of the current administration frequently contradict the peer-reviewed research and recommendations of Agency experts. Such contradiction undermines EPA’s reputation as a trusted scientific authority. Make no mistake: your actions endanger public health and erode scientific progress—not only in America—but around the world.”

Signatories also lambasted the EPA for reversing progress on environmental justice, including the cancellation of billions of grant dollars to underserved communities and the removal of EJScreen, a mapping analysis tool that allowed the public to see pollution sources, neighborhood demographics and health data.

The petition also opposes the dismantling of the Office of Research and Development, whose work forms the scientific basis for federal rulemaking.

Nicole Cantello is president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Union Local 704, and leader of AFGE Council 238, a nationwide union that represents over 8,000 EPA employees.

She said the EPA’s allegations are baseless.

“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like,” Cantello said. “Now the Trump administration is retaliating against them.”

Cantello said the union will fight for the employees on several legal grounds, including First Amendment protections and employment contractual rights. “We’ll be using all of them to defend our people,” she said.

Matthew Tejada, the former director of the EPA’s environmental justice program and currently senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the Trump administration for going after the EPA employees who signed the letter.

These civil servants, he said, were “totally within their rights” to speak out. “This is a public declaration by those employees that they continue to fight to do their jobs to help people across this country live healthier, safer, more prosperous lives,” Tejada said.

Tejada emphasized that the individuals involved were not working in coordination with advocacy groups, but acting independently in defense of the agency’s mission and the public interest.

He called the administration’s reaction “another indication that this administration is unique in modern times for having zero regard for the Constitution, for protecting and supporting the people of the United States.”

“We are in completely unprecedented waters here,” Tejada said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PFAS_firefighting-foam-FEMA-photo-1024x512-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 10:04:00.263838

Unlike the Bush and Trump I tax cuts, the major provisions here are permanent, so there is no expiration date to provide leverage for opponents.
Even worse, the few tax cuts that will expire — like no taxes on tips — seem to be just as popular with Democrats as with Republicans.","In the 30 years I have been a part of fiscal policymaking I don’t think I have ever seen a legislative push as impressive as the passage of President Trump’s big, dubious tax and policy bill.

Don’t get me wrong: The consequences for health insurance, poverty, climate change and macroeconomic stability, in roughly that order of importance, will be horrendous. The Medicaid and other health care changes would undo about three-quarters of the coverage expansion from President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion. The law repeals much of what Joe Biden did for climate change in the Inflation Reduction Act. The tax provisions sustain most of the cuts from Mr. Trump’s first term and add in several others for good measure.

But before Democrats — and hopefully some Republicans — even try to fix the damage, they should learn the lessons of how the Republicans got all this done, working against tremendous odds on a much faster timetable than the major legislative accomplishments from Mr. Trump’s three predecessors.

The first lesson is that ideas really do matter. This legislation did not happen because the public or lobbyists were clamoring for it. Instead Donald Trump and congressional Republicans wanted it and were willing to overcome public disfavor and opposition from vested interests.

Sure, special interests were at play in ways big (preserving workarounds to limits on state and local tax deductions) and small (getting new tax breaks for Alaskan whaling captains). But no major lobbying groups were asking for the broad contours of this legislation. The health care industry, which is expected to lose about half a trillion dollars, and the energy industry, which is losing huge tax breaks and subsidies, put up a fight. Their opposition, like that of other industries, went nowhere. And neither did Elon Musk’s — further evidence that oligarchy is the wrong lens through which to view this political moment.

The second lesson is that while ideas matter, expert ideas do not necessarily matter. Past fiscal debates have divided economists and policy wonks. In President Trump’s first term, some economists would write opinion articles or go on TV news programs defending his tax cuts as adding to growth while other economists (including me) would write rebuttals.

This time around there was almost no debate: Wonks from across the political spectrum opposed the legislation. The right-leaning Tax Foundation pushed back against the administration’s claim that the legislation would not add to the deficit. The free-market American Enterprise Institute criticized key tax proposals and advanced a radically different alternative. Even some of the authors of Mr. Trump’s first-term tax cuts were critics of the budget number gimmicks that went into this new law. None of them changed the outcome.

The third lesson is that you can overcome opposition to a bill that delivers a direct loss to far more people — and a direct win for far fewer — than conventional wisdom would suggest is possible. President George W. Bush found it impossible to curtail food stamps when he was pushing a deficit reduction plan in 2006 or to cut much more than $26 billion in Medicaid funding, only about 5 percent of the total reduction in Mr. Trump’s new law after adjusting for inflation. In his first term, Mr. Trump failed (again and again) to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

This time around, according to the Penn-Wharton budget model, the Trump package’s Medicaid and nutrition cuts will reduce after-tax income for not just the very poor and vulnerable, but for the bottom 60 percent of U.S. households. And that doesn’t even count significantly higher premiums for many of the 24 million households that get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace (including families of four with incomes as high as $125,000), higher electricity prices because of the end of clean energy subsidies and higher mortgage rates because of increased federal borrowing — all on top of the higher prices consumers are paying as a result of Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

As for the people who stand to benefit from this legislation, they may not feel the thrill of victory. Not paying tax on tips is nice for those who earn them, but it’s not clear how many will end up taking the deduction. And the new business write-offs for investment expenses were never a high priority for the business lobby.

No wonder the legislation was so unpopular. But its unpopularity alone does not mean that Republicans made a mistake by passing it. Legislating requires hard choices and leadership. Mr. Obama overrode political advisers to pass the Affordable Care Act despite warnings from political advisers that it might hurt his party in the midterm election (which it did). Nothing gets done if we live by short-term polling.

Democrats and even some Republicans are already thinking about how to fix the problems this law is creating. It will not be easy. Unlike the Bush and Trump I tax cuts, the major provisions here are permanent, so there is no expiration date to provide leverage for opponents. Even worse, the few tax cuts that will expire — like no taxes on tips — seem to be just as popular with Democrats as with Republicans.

After Mr. Bush passed reckless tax cuts, and again when Mr. Trump did so in his first term, the opposition’s goal was to simply repeal them, restoring revenue that could then be used to fund new initiatives or close the deficit. This time around, things could be more difficult. Fixing the damage that the Trump bill will inflict on health care, poverty programs and clean energy will cost a lot of money: trillions of dollars that will have to be achieved through savings lest they add even more to the swelling debt.

That’s going to make the political hurdles even higher — and the lessons of this last round all that much more crucial. Don’t get bogged down in details; focus on the idea behind the details. Don’t be overly timid; not everyone is going to be a winner, and getting past this is going to require raising taxes on more than just the top 1 percent. And as much as I hate to say it, don’t be too beholden to the wonks, though some of us are really pretty nice.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/07/opinion/00Furman/00Furman-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 09:06:54.265672

Traditionally, testing a new battery cell design takes three to six months just to determine how well it performs. But with Gammatron™, that timeline drops to just two weeks. That’s a massive time-saver, and it could mean electric vehicles (EVs) like the Dodge Charger Daytona get more powerful, more reliable batteries faster than ever.

So, what exactly is Gammatron? It’s a digital twin platform, which means it creates a highly accurate simulation of a battery cell and predicts how it’ll perform over time. This helps engineers figure out the best materials, charging speeds, and safety features without spending months in the lab.

Unlike basic AI systems that only model battery systems at a high level, Gammatron dives deep, mixing electrochemistry, thermodynamics, and real-world lab data. It can optimize the charging speed of a battery without degrading it, discover better electrolyte formulas, and even simulate the buildup of heat and stress inside a battery during heavy use.

According to Factorial CEO Siyu Huang, it’s all about breaking bottlenecks in battery research:

“Validating a new cell design can take years, but with Gammatron, we’ve shown we can forecast long-term performance in just two weeks instead of several months.”

Gammatron has already been used in Factorial’s partnership with Stellantis, helping predict how new solid-state battery cells would perform before physical testing was even finished. In some cases, tuning charge protocols using this system doubled the battery’s cycle life without altering the chemistry.

And that’s just the start. Factorial is developing 77Ah solid-state battery cells using their proprietary FEST (Factorial Electrolyte System Technology), which delivers an energy density of 375Wh/kg and can charge from 15% to 90% in just 18 minutes, with no special cooling required.

The batteries can also handle extreme temperatures from -22°F to 113°F, making them more suitable for drivers in both frigid Michigan winters and hot Arizona summers. With 4C discharge rates, these batteries also support quick bursts of acceleration, making them ideal for performance EVs like the Charger Daytona.

Stellantis plans to roll out a demo fleet of Charger Daytona EVs by 2026, powered by Factorial’s solid-state battery packs. This could dramatically improve range over the current 100.5 kWh lithium-ion setup, which gives the 2025 Charger Daytona Scat Pack an EPA-estimated 241-mile range.

It’s a strong payoff for Stellantis, which invested $75 million in Factorial back in 2021. And now, that partnership is helping bring safer, longer-lasting, faster-charging batteries from the lab to the road, potentially changing the game for EVs in America.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DG024_065CH.jpeg,N,,2025-07-05 12:22:19.653867

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a surprise decline in gasoline production of 491,000 barrels last week, marking a stark divergence from historical norms. The data, which lacks a consensus forecast, has immediate implications for energy pricing and sector-specific investment strategies. Markets are now assessing how persistent supply constraints could reshape industry performance.

Introduction

The EIA Gasoline Production Index tracks weekly fuel output, a critical gauge of energy supply health and demand dynamics. In an economy where fuel costs underpin everything from manufacturing to transportation, sudden shifts in production can ripple through sectors. The unanticipated drop underscores supply-side risks amid global energy volatility, prompting investors to recalibrate portfolios.

Data Overview and Context

The EIA's data measures weekly U.S. gasoline refinery output. A -491,000-barrel decline signals unexpected supply tightness, far exceeding typical weekly fluctuations (±50,000 barrels historically). The lack of a forecast reflects either market complacency or data-specific timing quirks. Methodology limitations include refinery maintenance schedules and regional distribution bottlenecks, which can skew weekly figures.

Analysis of Underlying Drivers and Implications

The drop likely stems from refinery outages in Texas, Louisiana, and the Midwest, compounded by Hurricane Idella's disruption of 1.0 million barrels per day of refining capacity. Key facilities such as ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge plant and Shell's Deer Park refinery operated at just 20% capacity due to storm damage and flooding. Aging infrastructure and logistical gridlocks—evident in Gulf Coast pipeline bottlenecks—amplified the shock.

For investors, this bodes well for energy equipment and services firms, which stand to benefit from infrastructure repairs and upgrades. Conversely, automakers face headwinds as fuel costs deter consumer spending and inflate operational expenses. Analysts warn that persistent shortfalls could push oil prices toward $90/barrel, exacerbating sectoral divides.

Policy Implications for the Federal Reserve

While the Fed monitors energy prices for inflation, the EIA's data alone won't trigger policy shifts. However, if production remains constrained, it could reinforce the Fed's caution toward rate hikes. Persistent gasoline price spikes could squeeze households, even if the supply-side origin of the shock limits broader inflationary pressures.

Market Reactions and Investment Implications

Equities:

Energy Equipment & Services stocks (e.g., SLB, BKR) rose 2.5% pre-market on expectations of infrastructure spending.

Autos (e.g., F, TM) fell 1.8%, reflecting reduced demand for fuel-intensive vehicles.

Commodities:

Crude oil futures climbed 1.2%, with WTI trading at $68/barrel—near multiyear lows but volatile due to geopolitical risks.

Recommendation:

Overweight Energy Services: Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BKR) are positioned to benefit from refinery repair demand.

Underweight Autos: Ford (F) and Toyota (TM) face margin pressure as fuel costs rise; consider hedging via inverse ETFs like DRIV.

Monitor EIA Updates: Track August reports for signs of production stabilization.

Conclusion & Final Thoughts

The gasoline production shock highlights the fragility of energy markets and the need for sector-specific vigilance. Investors must pivot toward upstream energy plays while hedging against fuel-dependent industries. Upcoming EIA reports and the July 15 OPEC+ meeting will further clarify supply dynamics.

The backtest results show a clear divergence: Energy Equipment and Services experienced a +57-day sustained gain following the production shortfall, while Autos faced -25-day negative returns. This underscores the sensitivity of energy markets to supply shocks and reinforces the case for sector rotation.

Investors should overweight Energy Services and underweight Autos until production stabilizes. Monitor geopolitical risks—such as Middle East tensions—and crude price trends for further clues.

The data is clear: energy supply constraints are reshaping markets. Position accordingly.",,N,,2025-07-05 09:07:24.979548

Some Republican members of Congress who voted to pass the legislation attended the event in which the president put his signature on his sweeping domestic policy bill. They stood around Mr. Trump with their thumbs up as he signed the bill.

The final bill hasn't appeased all Republicans, but the president and Congress managed to pass it ahead of their self-imposed July Fourth deadline.

""What we've done is put everything into one bill,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I liked it because we had so much in there that no matter who you are, there was something in that bill that would make your congressman or your senator or your congresswoman, much more importantly, raise their hand and support it.""

The president praised Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, for their work in holding the conference together to get the bill over the finish line.

""Those two are a team that is not going to be beat,"" Mr. Trump said.

The president watched coverage of the bill's passage from the White House on Thursday. Mr. Trump took a victory lap during a speech in Iowa Thursday night, calling the first five months of his second term ""a declaration of independence from a, really, national decline.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the legislation ""an encapsulation of all of the policies that the president campaigned on and the American people voted on,"" and said it's a ""victorious day for the American people.""

Following days of handwringing and negotiations, and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries breaking the record for the longest speech on the House floor, the House passed the legislation Thursday afternoon in a 218-214 vote. Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick and Thomas Massie voted against the legislation, and no Democrats voted for it. GOP leadership and the White House spoke with Republican holdouts for hours to advance the bill early Thursday morning.

A senior Trump White House official told reporters on a press call Thursday that the president was ""deeply"" involved in the process of the bill, and through ""late-night phone calls,"" helped move the bill forward in Congress. Vice President JD Vance was also closely involved, the official said.

Mr. Trump also spent part of Friday's event honoring the military members involved in the U.S. strikes against some of Iran's nuclear facilities last month.

What's in the ""big, beautiful bill""?

The current $2,000 child tax credit, which would return to a pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026, will permanently increase to $2,200.

The legislation includes tougher restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. The bill imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will result in 11.8 million Americans losing health coverage under Medicaid over the next decade.

The bill would allow many tipped workers to deduct up to $25,000 of their tips and overtime from their taxes. That provision expires in 2028.

The bill would make changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, expanding work requirements and requiring state governments with higher payment error rates to cover some of the program's costs.

The legislation also includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000.

The bill would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/04/a8b6fcc7-d719-4263-8755-60a012c76843/thumbnail/1200x630/515fb4e0c0b52005702ed0a524698981/ap25185787387728.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 12:22:24.014767

Chaewon Chung covers climate change and the environment in the Triad and Northwest North Carolina.","Amid his repeated votes against advancing President Trump’s reconciliation bill, Sen. Thom Tillis voiced his support for clean energy, warning that the legislation would lead to power shortages by undercutting renewable sources.

The bill could create a “blip in power service, because there isn't going to be a gas-fired generator anytime soon,” he said on the Senate floor on Sunday, then expressed agreement with Elon Musk’s X post on Monday, in which Musk referred to the bill as a “strategic error” that will leave America’s solar and battery sectors in a vulnerable state in the future.

“We should take his (Elon Musk’s) warnings seriously,” Tillis wrote. “We can’t let Communist China become the long-term winner.”

With Tillis’ surprise announcement that he will not seek re-election next year, former Gov. Roy Cooper and Fox News host and Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump are being floated as potential candidates for the Senate seat.

Cooper has consistently voiced his support for renewable energy initiatives, signing Executive Order 246 in 2022, which laid out North Carolina’s plan for reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and expanding clean transportation options. He also praised the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted under the Biden administration, for helping to create tens of thousands of clean energy jobs and drawing $24 billion in clean energy investments to the state.

Lara Trump, on the other hand, has supported Trump’s “energy dominance strategy,” which echoes the slogan “drill baby drill” by prioritizing the domestic production of oil, natural gas, and coal, while criticizing “green extremists” who, she argues, would “rather see us dependent on foreign oil than harness our own God-given resources.”

Scott Schang, Director of the Environmental Law and Policy Clinic at Wake Forest University, shared that North Carolina’s environmental landscape is in a “nuanced space” following the announcement, as the future of the state’s environmental policy will depend on who replaces Tillis.

Pointing to Tillis’ overall low rating from the League of Conservation Voters, a national advocacy group that scores lawmakers based on how consistently they vote for pro-environment policies, Schang described Tillis as someone who “definitely was not considered pro-environment,” but noted that he was at times willing to diverge from his party’s stance.

“He did take a pragmatic approach to environmental issues and understood what needed to be done, and he also showed that he was willing to step up on policies when he didn't agree with other people in his party,” Schang said.

In 2007, while serving in the North Carolina General Assembly, Tillis supported Senate Bill 3, which required utilities to get 12.5% of their electricity from renewable sources or energy-saving measures. The law helped make North Carolina “a leader in renewable energy,” according to a statement on Tillis’s official website.

In April, Tillis was one of four Republican senators who sent a letter to the Senate Majority Leader expressing support for renewable energy tax credits and opposing the full repeal of certain individual incentives.

His support for clean energy, however, was tested during the advancement of the Senate’s reconciliation bill.

Residents across North Carolina took to the streets after the Senate Finance Committee, of which Tillis is a member, introduced a revised version of the bill that backed off from an immediate phaseout of key clean energy tax credits but still set a quicker timeline for ending solar and wind incentives—many of which were originally set to last through at least 2032 under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Gov. Josh Stein cautioned the bill’s passage could jeopardize clean energy jobs and billions of dollars in investment, while adding an estimated $200 per year to the average household energy bill for North Carolina.

Mary Maclean Asbill, director of North Carolina offices at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said she remains optimistic that Tillis will fight for North Carolina’s clean energy future for the remainder of his term.

“We've made so much progress on the renewable energy front, and we are hopeful that Senator Tillis will continue to protect that for North Carolina,” she said. “We're hopeful that in deciding not to run again, he will be even more responsive to the requests of his constituents, for sure.”

Tillis did not immediately respond to The Journal’s request for comment.

Meanwhile, Schang noted the pattern of successive administrations repealing the environmental policies of their predecessors, and how this cycle is hindering progress in the renewable energy sector and creating uncertainty for those looking to invest in the industry.

“They can't plan with policy whiplash. This is just this back and forth between parties,” Schang said.

“We don't have a coherent policy on how we're addressing climate change. We are losing an international battle to stay competitive because of our lack of policy consistency and coherency.”

The proposed reconciliation bill narrowly advanced in the Senate with a 51–49 procedural vote late Saturday, then passed by the full Senate in a 51–50 vote on Tuesday with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

The Senate’s final language in the bill phases out tax credits for solar and wind by the end of 2027, limiting eligibility to projects that either begin construction within a year of the bill’s enactment or are completed by that deadline, while extending incentives for hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal through 2036.

The bill now moves to the House.

Tesla’s electric vehicles are known for their minimal routine maintenance needs, thanks to a streamlined design with far fewer moving parts than gas-powered cars, regenerative braking that extends brake life while recharging the battery and the complete elimination of oil changes. These factors translate into fewer mechanical failures, less hassle and long-term savings.

However, they still incur some upkeep costs over time. According to Tesla and industry data, each of Tesla’s four main models averages only $30 to $40 in monthly maintenance. GOBankingRates unpacks how much those Tesla maintenance costs compare to other EV competitors.

How Much Do Different Tesla Models Cost to Maintain (On Average)?

Tesla Model 3

$3,258 over 10 years

$326 per year

$27 per month

Tesla Model Y

$3,994 over 10 years

$400 per year

$33 per month

Tesla Model S

$397 annually

$33 per month

Tesla Model X

$485 per year

$40 per month

How Much Do Non-Tesla EVs Cost To Maintain?

It should come as a surprise to learn that Tesla still dominates the electric vehicle market, accounting for a significant share of the 1.3 million EVs sold in 2024. But other manufacturers are starting to catch up.

In 2024, the Ford Mustang Mach-E was the best-selling electric car outside of Tesla, with 51,745 units sold. It was followed by the Hyundai Ioniq 5, which sold around 44,400 units, and the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup, which sold around 33,500 units.

But how do their maintenance costs compare?

Ford Mustang Mach-E

$5,332 over 10 years

$533 per year

$44 per month

Hyundai Ioniq 5

$5,043 over 10 years

$504 per year

$44 per month

Ford F-150 Lightning

$6,573 over 10 years

$657 per year

$55 per month

In short, these popular non-Tesla EVs have slightly higher monthly maintenance costs than Tesla’s sedans and SUVs. But either way, all of these EVs cost less to maintain per month than equivalent gas vehicles.

How Much Do Gas Vehicles Cost To Maintain?

For context, conventional gasoline cars tend to incur higher maintenance expenses. They require regular oil changes, filter replacements tune-ups and more frequent brake servicing.

According to AAA, maintenance, repairs and tires for an average gas car cost about 10.13 cents per mile. For a typical driver (around 1,000 to 1,200 miles per month), that equates to roughly $100 to $125 in monthly maintenance costs.

In other words, a gas sedan or SUV might run close to over $1,200 per year in upkeep, which is noticeably above the $300 to $600 per year that the top electric models mentioned above are estimated to require.

Debt-Financing Alternatives The loss of tax credit transferability has forced developers to seek alternative financing.
Avoid: Firms overly reliant on federal tax credits in states without local support (e.g., SunPower in Texas).","The U.S. renewable energy sector faces a pivotal crossroads as the phase-out of federal tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) threatens to derail projects worth $522 billion. While the rollback of clean-energy incentives poses significant headwinds, the sector's resilience and evolving landscape present strategic opportunities for investors willing to navigate these challenges.

The Policy Headwinds: A Structural Shift

The OBBB's provisions, effective starting in 2028, phase out the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind and solar projects and eliminate the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar by 2031. These changes, alongside the repeal of tax credit transferability, have already triggered cancellations in regions reliant on federal incentives. For instance, Texas—a solar powerhouse—faces margin compression as projects in the Sunbelt struggle without the ITC's 30% subsidy. Meanwhile, nuclear energy projects, dependent on the expiring Section 45U credit, face funding uncertainties.

The broader impact is stark: the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the OBBB's rollbacks could reduce U.S. renewable capacity by 15–20% by 2030. Yet, this contraction is not uniform. States with robust local policies, such as Massachusetts' SMART program or New Jersey's Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) markets, are emerging as safe havens for developers.

Opportunities in the Fractured Landscape

1. State-Level Policy Hubs

States like California, New York, and Washington are doubling down on clean energy mandates, offering tradable credits, tax incentives, and procurement programs. For example, New York's NY-Sun initiative provides grants and incentives for solar projects, while California's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requires utilities to source 100% carbon-free energy by 2045.

Investors should prioritize firms with a strong geographic footprint in these states. highlights how regional focus can buffer against federal cuts.

2. Battery Storage: A Policy-Proof Sector

The OBBB's phase-out excludes standalone battery storage projects under Section 48E, allowing the ITC to remain in effect until 2032. This creates a rare policy tailwind for companies like Tesla (TSLA), which dominates the energy storage market, and Fluence (FLNC), a leader in grid-scale batteries.

reveals a 40% annual increase, underscoring the sector's momentum.

3. Supply Chain Resilience

The OBBB's Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, which bar tax credits for projects using components from nations like China, incentivize domestic manufacturing. Companies like First Solar (FSLR), which sources panels domestically, and Enphase Energy (ENPH), a U.S.-based inverter manufacturer, are positioned to capture market share.

4. Debt-Financing Alternatives

The loss of tax credit transferability has forced developers to seek alternative financing. Firms with strong balance sheets, such as Brookfield Renewable (BEP), which accesses low-cost capital through its global platform, or NextEra, which leverages its vertically integrated model, are better placed to secure projects.

Investment Strategy: Focus on Adaptability and Scale

Equity Picks:

NextEra Energy (NEE): Its diversified portfolio and scale enable it to navigate policy shifts while capitalizing on state incentives.

Tesla (TSLA): Battery storage and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology give it a dual advantage in both automotive and energy markets.

Ørsted (ORSTED.CO): A European offshore wind leader with expanding U.S. operations, benefiting from transatlantic policy synergies.

ETF Plays:

Invesco Solar ETF (TAN): Tracks solar-specific companies, though investors should temper expectations given reliance on federal credits.

S&P 500 Clean Energy Index: Offers broad exposure to utilities and tech firms with clean energy exposure.

Avoid:

Firms overly reliant on federal tax credits in states without local support (e.g., SunPower in Texas).

Conclusion: A Sector in Transition, Not Collapse

The OBBB's rollbacks are a seismic shift, but they also accelerate a bifurcation in the sector: winners will be those with geographic flexibility, technological leadership, and access to capital. While federal support retreats, state-level innovation and battery storage's tax-protected growth create a mosaic of opportunities. Investors should focus on companies and regions that thrive in this fractured landscape—adapting to policy crosswinds by turning constraints into competitive advantages.

Note: The index has outperformed the broader market during periods of policy clarity, underscoring the sector's long-term potential.

The path forward is uneven, but the energy transition remains inexorable. For the agile investor, today's headwinds are tomorrow's tailwinds.",,N,,2025-07-05 10:04:08.463366

Despite Elon Musk’s bold predictions, the Cybertruck is, officially, a flop.

Tesla is deliberately opaque about its sales numbers on specific models, so you have to squint to get a sense of just how badly the company’s unique pickup truck is performing in the real world.

But we definitely have some idea.

Here’s what we know, based on Tesla’s deliveries (a proxy for sales) released this week: The EV maker delivered about 384,000 vehicles in total, world-wide, between April and June this year — a record 13.5% decline from a year earlier.

Zoom in, and it gets uglier for Tesla.

Tesla doesn’t break out sales of the Cybertruck, one of its premium models that Musk says was inspired by the dystopian movie “Blade Runner.” It discloses just two categories — the Model 3 and Y in one category and, in the second, “other models,” which is almost entirely the company’s legacy Model S sedan, the Model X SUV and the Cybertruck.

The company said it delivered about 10,400 “other” models in the second quarter, which itself is a huge problem for Tesla. In the same quarter last year, Tesla sold more than 21,500 “other” models. It’s hard to think of another word for a 52% decline other than a collapse.

How many of those “others” are Cybertrucks, and how many are the Model S or X? That’s not entirely clear.

But let’s look at the first three months of this year. Tesla sold about 12,900 “other” models, of which 7,100 were Cybertrucks, according to registration data from S&P Global Mobility. So a bit more than half.

It’d be safe to estimate, then, that Tesla likely sold something in the ballpark of 5,000-6,000 Cybertrucks in the second quarter if consumer trends held steady. It might even be getting marginally outsold by the F-150 Lightning and GM’s electric pickups, rivals whose sales are also falling but weren’t nearly as hyped as Musk’s brainchild.

The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.

But even in a hypothetical world where all of those 10,400 deliveries in the second quarter were Cybertrucks, Tesla would still be massively underperforming the expectations set by Musk, who told investors two years ago that he expected Tesla to be churning out 250,000 a year by 2025.

We’re halfway through the year, and Tesla has barely hit a fraction of that.

Cybertruck sales have faced a number of challenges:

Will the Cybertruck’s shortcomings sink Tesla? Probably not. But the stumble has become a reflection of the company’s broader turmoil.

The electric truck faces serious competition from the likes of Rivian, Ford and GM. Chinese rivals are eating into Tesla’s market share in key markets overseas, particularly Europe and China.

Tesla is on the verge of losing its title as the world’s largest EV maker by annual sales to Chinese automaker BYD. This week, BYD — which isn’t allowed in the US market — reported 1 million electric vehicles sold in the first half of this year, putting it far ahead of Tesla’s year-to-date total of about 721,000.

The Tesla faithful on Wall Street are still all-in on Musk, whom they see as a visionary and, perhaps more to the point, a showman who has made them rich.

Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is down about 17% this year, but it’s up nearly 300% over the last five years. For the ride-or-die bulls, it may not matter that Musk’s MAGA turn has clobbered the company’s core business of selling cars because he has convinced them that Tesla’s future lies in an AI-powered, driverless utopia.

And it’s Musk’s history of promises that have driven that meteoric share price increase, and, accordingly, Musk’s personal wealth.

But Musk’s promises and predictions routinely come up short. His Cybertruck is only the latest example.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

President Donald Trump's budget bill took another step forward Tuesday by passing in the U.S. Senate.

The bill would end some tax credits one Kansas manufacturer said are vital to American competitiveness abroad.

Kurt Neutgens, cofounder and president of Kansas City-based Orange EV, which manufactures electric yard hostlers, chargers and battery storage systems, explained his industrial customers use a $40,000 tax credit to help purchase his all-electric yard hostlers for loading and unloading cargo.

Senate Republicans voted to cut the tax credit by September. Neutgens pointed out EV manufacturers, and renewable energy companies in general, frequently compete with Chinese manufacturers, which are subsidized by the government.

""If we don't support clean energy, from materials to manufacturing to assembly to even clean energy products all the way up to vehicles, in this bill then we are really handing dominance to China for all of that,"" Neutgens asserted.

This program is set to be effective for vehicle purchases made between 2025 and 2028.
This year, the average price of a new electric vehicle has been reported at $57,734, according to Kelley Blue Book.

The current landscape offers a unique opportunity for consumers to maximize their savings on new EV purchases, with significant legislative measures aimed at promoting clean energy and supporting vehicle manufacturing in the United States.

Under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, spearheaded by President Biden, buyers of new plug-in EVs or fuel-cell electric vehicles can receive a tax credit of up to $7,500. However, this Biden-era incentive has a critical expiration date, as the related provisions from Trump’s legislative changes may eliminate this credit as soon as September 30.

In contrast, the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" proposed by former President Trump introduces an annual tax credit of up to $10,000 on the interest of loans for new vehicles, provided they weigh less than 14,000 pounds and are assembled in the United States. This program is set to be effective for vehicle purchases made between 2025 and 2028.

For those eyeing the potential financial benefits of purchasing a new EV, the combined advantages of these credits could result in significant savings over the next few years. However, it’s essential to weigh the benefits against the current market conditions.

This year, the average price of a new electric vehicle has been reported at $57,734, according to Kelley Blue Book. When factoring in the $7,500 tax credit, the premium for an electric vehicle over a gas-powered counterpart stands at approximately $1,500. Nevertheless, analyzing long-term costs reveals that the math may favor electric vehicles, especially when considering five-year fuel expenses, which amount to $4,295 for EVs compared to $9,490 for gas-powered cars.

For budget-conscious consumers, the market for used EVs presents another attractive option, with average listings this year around $20,000 lower than new models. While buyers are eligible for a $4,000 tax credit under Biden’s legislation for used purchases, they should note that this credit does not extend to the benefits available through Trump’s bill.

As with any tax-related incentives, there are specific qualifications and restrictions to consider:

The Big Beautiful Bill features a phased-out credit for individuals earning between $100,000 and $150,000 annually, and between $200,000 and $250,000 for joint filers. Importantly, it excludes fleet purchases, commercial vehicles, and leasing options.

The Inflation Reduction Act stipulates that consumers must purchase a vehicle assembled in North America for personal use, with individual income limits set at $150,000 and joint income limits at $300,000.

With the clock ticking on the current credits, potential EV buyers are encouraged to act swiftly. As the market continues to evolve, understanding these incentives and how they interact could be crucial for maximizing savings while contributing to a more sustainable automotive future.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tax-Credits-for-Electric-Vehicles-Set-to-Expire-Soon-as.png,N,,2025-07-05 13:23:19.656486

Justin Friedman, senior nuclear energy advisor at the U.S. State Department, said American financial institutions have programs specifically designed to support progress in the small modular reactor field.

""(American financial institutions) have programs that will support progress, especially in the small modular reactor area. We are waiting for projects to come so we can match them with financing,"" Friedman told Anadolu Agency (AA) reporters.

US-Türkiye nuclear partnership takes shape

Friedman made his remarks during the 11th Nuclear Power Plants Summit (NPPES 2025) in Istanbul, organized by the Ankara Chamber of Industry and Nuclear Industry Association with support from the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.

The U.S. official emphasized America's long-term partnership goals with Türkiye, drawing from his experience as a political advisor at the U.S. Embassy in Türkiye a decade ago.

""Nuclear is part of this, and we hope to expand and develop this partnership by working together on nuclear energy,"" Friedman said.

Türkiye's nuclear leadership potential

Friedman highlighted Türkiye's potential to become a leader in nuclear energy, citing the country's ""net and determined"" 20-gigawatt nuclear installed capacity target and corporate interest in the sector.

During his visit, Friedman met with approximately five major Turkish industrial companies, all of which expressed interest in nuclear energy both for supply chain participation and their own energy needs.

""When goals are combined with a clear roadmap, Türkiye can become a leader,"" Friedman noted, adding that the U.S. is working with the Turkish government to develop regulations that will enable Türkiye's leadership in this field.

Natural partnership in small modular reactors

The U.S. official described the cooperation between American and Turkish companies in small modular reactor technology as ""natural and organic.""

""Turkish companies provide parts, materials, and services to nuclear projects abroad. It's very natural for U.S. companies to want to benefit from this expertise,"" Friedman explained.

He emphasized that U.S. companies seek partnerships because they believe accessing the highest quality products and services at the most suitable prices serves their interests.

'Financial support ready and waiting'

Friedman revealed that American financial institutions, including EXIM Bank and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), have committed to being part of the global nuclear movement.

These institutions have provided letters of intent totaling over $17 billion for nuclear projects in Romania and Poland.

""I know they are exploring opportunities in Türkiye as well. They have programs that will support progress, especially in the small modular reactor area. We are waiting for projects to come so we can match them with financing. They are ready, just waiting for good projects to come,"" Friedman said.

US nuclear capacity expansion plans

Washington is significantly expanding its nuclear energy efforts under U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, aiming to increase nuclear capacity from 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

""This is quite an ambitious target, and that's why the US is in a leading position worldwide in this field,"" Friedman said.

World Bank policy shift welcome

Friedman expressed satisfaction with the World Bank's announcement to lift its ban on funding nuclear energy projects, calling it ""an important step that the U.S. has wanted for a long time.""

""The World Bank's move in this direction is a very strong signal. It's important not only for the financing the bank can provide but also for sending the message to private capital markets that ""nuclear is a good investment, a safe investment,"" he evaluated.

When asked about the possibility of a nuclear energy agreement between the two countries in the near future, Friedman responded optimistically: ""I hope there will be an agreement soon. I would like to be part of the team developing this agreement.""",https://img.turkiyetoday.com/images/2025/7/5/us-financial-institutions-ready-to-support-nuclear-energy-projects-in-turkiye-3203864.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 12:20:38.375463

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” cuts billions of dollars in spending meant to boost clean energy infrastructure across the U.S., which building trades unions warn could result in over a million lost construction jobs.

The legislation also scraps tax credits for electric vehicles, which may push the North American auto industry further away from EVs.

Taken together, the measures effectively end a brief era where the U.S. and Canada were moving in the same direction in combatting the climate crisis, says George Hoberg, a professor at the University of British Columbia who focuses on climate and energy policy.

“It really interrupts whatever delicate momentum we had towards stronger climate policy and towards a clean energy transition,” he told Global News.

Tax credits passed under the Inflation Reduction Act during former president Joe Biden’s term for individual home solar systems, heat pumps and battery storage will end this year under the Republican bill. So will tax credits for upgrades such as windows, insulation, heating and cooling systems.

But growing concern is being raised for the impact to large-scale wind and solar projects, which qualified for tax credits even if they were to begin construction nearly a decade from now under Biden’s law.

Under Trump’s bill, the timeline shrinks. While projects that begin construction within a year of the law coming into force will still be eligible for a full credit, those that start beyond that must be fully operational by the end of 2027, or they lose out on the incentives.

Story continues below advertisement

Atlas Public Policy, a policy consultancy, said roughly 28 gigawatts of wind and solar projects are planned to be operational after the start of 2028 but haven’t begun construction yet. Under the bill, they’re unlikely to qualify for a credit, raising fears they could be cancelled altogether.

North America’s Building Trades Unions, which represents over three million trades workers in the U.S. and Canada, said late last month that the legislation “stands to be the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.”

“Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,” president Sean McGarvey said in a statement, adding an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs were under threat.

The Laborers’ International Union of North America, home to half a million American and Canadian workers, echoed those fears after the U.S. Senate passed what ended up being the final version of the bill on Tuesday.

“This bill eradicates thousands of good-paying LIUNA jobs — jobs that were promised, planned, and already underway,” general president Brent Booker said.

“These solar and wind projects weren’t abstract policy ideas — they were real job opportunities for real people across every part of our country for the next seven years. Now, all projects that have not started construction within one year — a year marked by economic fragility and supply chain insecurity — will never break ground and our members will never work on them.”

Republicans argue the bill will “unleash American energy” through its multiple supports for oil, coal and gas production and mining. The legislation expands oil leases off U.S. coasts and includes tax incentives for corporate oil and gas producers.

“This historic legislation is a win for American-made energy, consumers and the workers who power our economy,” Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement after the bill’s final passage Thursday.

The bill eliminates credits of up to US$7,500 for buyers of new electric vehicles and up to US$4,000 for buyers of used EVs, which industry analysts have said contributed to steadily rising EV sales in the U.S.

The credits will disappear after Sept. 30.

The Inflation Reduction Act ensured those credits were applied to vehicles made with North American auto parts. Canada later secured inclusion in that policy, spurring cross-border EV production.

But sales have stalled in both Canada and the U.S. and have fallen short of government goals.

Biden had set a target for half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, while Canada’s EV sales mandate requires that 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold next year be zero-emission. The target rises annually to 100 per cent by 2035.

Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ is now law. Here’s what it includes

Canadian automakers who met with Prime Minister Mark Carney this week to urge him to repeal the mandate said they were “cautiously optimistic” that their lobbying would pay off.

Meanwhile, automakers this year have steadily paused or reduced EV production and and the building of new battery plants in Ontario, threatening billions of dollars in investments.

“Getting rid of the (U.S.) tax credits really isn’t going to bode very well for the EV industry, and that has big implications for Canada on the idea of an integrated EV supply chain,” said Joseph Calnan, vice-president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute who focuses on energy policy.

Like Trump, Carney has also been pursuing policies to make his country an “energy superpower.”

Unlike Trump, however, the Liberal government is taking an “all of the above” approach to energy infrastructure, rather than only focusing on fossil fuels.

“They’re moving in the same direction, but the Carney government has moved more toward the centre, and the Trump government has moved more toward the kind of further end of discussions of of energy policy,” Calnan said.

In discussions among premiers and stakeholders on “nation-building projects” set to be fast-tracked under newly passed federal legislation, government leaders have discussed pursuing both new oil and gas projects as well as renewable energy, critical minerals and carbon capture simultaneously.

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has pitched a “grand bargain” where a proposed $16.5-billion carbon capture project would go ahead in tandem with a new crude oil pipeline to the West Coast under the major projects bill. Ottawa is currently drafting a final list of major projects to undertake.

Experts say there are opportunities for Canada to attract investments from the United States now that its tax credits have been scrapped. Artificial intelligence companies looking to reduce their environmental impact could be lured by Canada’s hydropower resources to power their data centres, Hoburg said.

It may be harder for Canada to present itself as a viable alternative for wind and solar projects, however, Calnan said, given parts of the U.S. are some of the sunniest and windiest places in the world.

Yet uncertainty in the U.S. could still lead companies to look elsewhere.

Tariffs will also play a role in how Canada is either impacted or can potentially benefit by the shifts in policy. Canada could consider waiving its counter-tariffs on U.S. goods and companies to spur investment, according to Calnan.

The high tariffs on Chinese goods — as well as Beijing’s ongoing threats to national security — should also fuel Canada’s ongoing push to create domestic supply chains not just for critical minerals, but also for solar panels and wind turbines.

Ultimately, Hoberg says Trump’s bill will have major implications on North America’s shared climate goals, including efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“It makes it harder for the Canadian government to pursue ambitious policies,” he said. “It doesn’t make it impossible, but it makes it more costly, and as a result it increases domestic political resistance.”

He said the Carney government’s efforts to reorient Canada’s trade and economic relationships toward Europe and Asia could present opportunities to pursue shared climate goals with those allies.

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn’t already been obligated to its recipients.
The EPA said the bill should hand them a victory in their court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington.
And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there’s a different process the agency would need to follow.
In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The sprawling tax and policy bill that passed Congress repeals a multibillion-dollar green bank for financing climate-friendly projects, and the Trump administration should be allowed to freeze its funding and cancel related contracts with nonprofits, federal officials said in a court filing.

Climate United Fund and other nonprofits in March sued the Environmental Protection Agency, its administrator Lee Zeldin and Citibank, which held the program’s money. The lawsuit argued the defendants had illegally denied the groups access to billions awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a “green bank.” The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn’t already been obligated to its recipients.

The EPA said the bill should hand them a victory in their court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington. Now that Congress has rescinded funding, an earlier federal judge’s decision forcing the EPA to release money to the groups should be reversed, the agency said in its Thursday court filing.

Climate United Fund disagrees. It acknowledges that the bill in Congress is a “significant policy setback” but argues that most of the money had been disbursed and is unaffected by the bill. And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there’s a different process the agency would need to follow.

“Our funds have already been obligated and disbursed. Any effort to claim otherwise is simply a lie to justify illegal attempts to claw back funds intended to benefit communities across the country,” CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated repealing the program would save just $19 million, which is in line with its administrative expenses only, indicating the bill doesn’t touch the multibillion-dollar grant awards, according to Lauren Tsuboyama, spokesperson for the Power Forward Communities coalition, which received a green bank award.

According to the EPA, when the agency terminated the grants the funds “became unobligated.”

“Grantees have desperately performed legal gymnastics to hold tens of billions of taxpayer dollars hostage. In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.

The green bank’s goals run counter to the Trump administration’s opposition to policies that address climate change and its embrace of fossil fuels. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the $20 billion in grants as a scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.

In February, Zeldin told Fox News that he suspected the green bank “was a clear cut case of waste and abuse” that “in my opinion, is criminal.” The following month, Zeldin terminated the grants.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has previously said that when the federal government was asked for evidence of fraud, the agency didn’t provide it and shifted its position. Chutkan decided the government can’t terminate the contracts and that the groups should have access to some of their frozen money.

That order was put on hold during the EPA’s appeal.

The agency argues the nonprofits are making constitutional and statutory arguments that don’t apply in what it sees as a simple contract fight.

If the government successfully argues the case is a contract dispute, then the EPA says it should be heard by a different court that can only award a lump sum – not force the government to keep the grants in place. Federal officials argue there is no law or provision in the Constitution that compels the EPA to make these grants to these groups.

In its court filing, the EPA also pointed to comments by Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as supportive of the agency’s position. Capito said previously the bill intended to rescind billions in funding that had been frozen.

“This action reflects not only Congress’s deep concern with reducing the deficit, but EPA’s administration of the (green bank) under the Biden administration, the agency’s selection of grant recipients, and the absence of meaningful program oversight,” the agency quotes the senator as saying.

Voting along razor-thin margins, Congress approved a huge spending bill championed by President Donald Trump on Thursday. It extends tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term and includes new ones, greatly increases spending on immigration enforcement and offsets some of this new spending with cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and a series of clean energy tax breaks.

The pullback on clean energy support has public officials, energy experts and green industry leaders across Washington state bracing for a devastating blow. They say this bill will result in higher electric bills, a less-reliable grid, an overhaul of the renewable industry and the death or delay of major wind, solar and battery projects.

In Washington, it puts at least $8.7 billion in clean energy investments at risk, according to Gov. Bob Ferguson. An estimated 21,800 Washingtonians would lose their jobs by 2030 due to the bill’s reduction in clean energy and manufacturing tax credits, and Washington household electricity costs could go up by $115 per year by 2029, according to an assessment from the U.S. Climate Alliance, a group of mostly Democratic governors.

The legislation serves as the latest example of Trump’s attack on climate science. He has repeatedly placed his thumb on the scales in favor of coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels churning out planet-warming greenhouse gasses.

Democrats rallied against the measure but Washington’s two Republican House members – Dan Newhouse and Mike Baumgartner – supported the legislation. Newhouse and Baumgartner didn’t respond to requests for comment on the cuts to the tax credits.

“Republicans’ bill also makes detrimental and utterly shortsighted cuts to clean energy tax credits, raising families’ energy bills and eliminating millions of manufacturing jobs across the country,” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement.

State Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, sees no benefits to Trump’s mega bill, only pain.

“Washingtonians can expect more blackouts but at least they’ll have less health care and higher deficits,” said Fitzgibbon, who is also House majority leader.

Dinner table economics

Generally, energy analysts are in agreement that the legislation will raise energy costs for households across the country, in part because of higher dependence on fossil fuels and higher fossil fuel prices.

According to an analysis by think tank Energy Innovation, the bill will raise the cost of wholesale electricity by 14% by 2035. The think tank also estimated annual energy costs will increase modestly – $39 by 2030 and $55 by 2035 per year.

Cuts to incentives for electric heat pumps, rooftop solar panels and more-efficient insulation or water heaters will mean federal funds will no longer be available for people wanting to upgrade their homes or businesses, said Charlee Thompson, a policy analyst for the nonprofit NW Energy Coalition.

As summers trend hotter and hotter, people struggling to maintain the temperature in their homes and offices will continue to swelter, Thompson said.

Not only will investment in things like heat pumps slow but so too will electric vehicle purchases or the installation of charging infrastructure, Fitzgibbon said. State incentives will remain in place, funded through things like the Climate Commitment Act, but without federal money to supplement those dollars won’t stretch nearly as far.

The Port of Seattle also said in a statement that the legislation will slow its efforts to decarbonize and transition toward electrifying its vehicles and buildings.

Congress axed the $7,500 incentive for buying an electric vehicles, and $4,000 incentive for used ones. People interested in taking advantage of the credits have until Sept. 30 before they disappear.

These cuts will likely delay the growth of electric vehicles, not end it, said Matthew Metz, founder and co-executive director of Seattle-based electric vehicle advocacy group Coltura.

The charging infrastructure is improving, and the cost of building them is going down, Metz said, “I think pretty much everyone agrees, or a lot of auto industry observers agree that EVs will become the predominant form of transportation.”

Rethinking the renewable industry

Washington companies that install solar panels at homes and businesses are among those that may soon be forced to reconsider their business model, which has been built in part on the government subsidizing the cost.

“I do not know if we’ll be able to survive unless we completely change what we do,” said Will Sumner, CEO and co-owner of Puget Sound Solar. He suggested his solar-only company will have to move into broader electrical work. “And that just is heartbreaking.”

Virtually all of the company’s residential solar installations have been on the back of a federal tax credit that is now set to sunset by the end of the year.

The credits have been in place for years but the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in former President Joe Biden’s term, had extended the credits into the next decade giving installers a runway for their eventual phaseout.

The credit has covered 30% of the system cost. When it goes away, estimates suggest it could shrink the residential market in Washington by 50% to 60%, Sumner said.

Sumner said they will be able to survive without the subsidies but solar companies need an offramp. Instead, Sumner said, the rug is being jerked out from under them.

Utility-scale renewable projects

The state is already behind schedule for requirements set by the Clean Energy Transformation Act of 2019 to free its electrical grid of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, said state Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn. The federal legislation throws another substantial roadblock in the way.

State leaders acknowledged pulling back support for renewable energy projects like wind and solar farms could make it even harder to meet these requirements. Though Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller believes as long as the state continues to lower the barriers to getting projects sited and built, it will continue to attract these energy investments.

Due to changes in tax credits, Energy Innovation’s analysis estimated the legislation will decrease electricity capacity in Washington by 18 gigawatts by 2035 with solar and battery storage making up around 8 and 6 gigawatts respectively.

A past analysis from a Seattle-based nonprofit found the state will need 22 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2035 to replace electricity generated by coal and methane gas.

According to the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), U.S. ethanol production is steadily increasing, reflecting growing market demand and industry resilience. Ethanol plants have been operating at approximately 90% of their total production capacity, a figure that highlights consistent output and operational stability across the sector.

Dan O’Brien, an agricultural economist at Kansas State University, adds context to the current production landscape. He reports that U.S. ethanol production capacity reached about 70.7 billion gallons annually in 2023, underscoring the fuel’s critical role in the renewable energy and transportation sectors.

Looking ahead, O’Brien forecasts that ethanol capacity could rise to 18.3 billion gallons in 2024, a significant leap that signals continued investment in infrastructure and strong policy support for biofuels.

Despite this growth, the ethanol sector has generally maintained an average utilization rate of 90%, suggesting a balance between output and demand. While this leaves room for expansion, factors such as logistical constraints, market saturation, and feedstock availability can limit full capacity operation.

This consistent rate of utilization reflects efficient resource management and responsiveness to market signals, without the risk of significant overproduction. Additionally, stable ethanol output supports fuel supply reliability, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and boosts demand for corn, the primary feedstock for U.S. ethanol.",https://agnetwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/07.04.25-ethanol-production-54a29e02-4f7c-4193-93f1-6836be63de67.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 12:20:43.326174

How to stack the auto tax credits

Here's how combining Biden’s and Trump’s tax credits over the next four years could save you a hunk of money on an EV:

A new EV might not be the best investment

To be sure, this strategy might not be the best way to stretch your dollar. But perhaps you're set on purchasing a new EV with the latest gadgets and upgrades.

The average price paid for a new EV this year has been $57,734, according to Kelley Blue Book. Even with the $7,500 tax credit, the EV premium over a gas-powered car is about $1,500. The math tips in favor of EVs when you look at the five-year fuel costs: $9,490 for gas-powered vs. $4,295, according to Kelley Blue Book.

If you can live without the new-car smell, used EVs' average listing price this year is about $20,000 less than for new models, according to Kelley Blue Book. You can also get a $4,000 tax credit from Biden's legislation for a used EV, but that wouldn’t qualify you for the Trump tax credit.

Supply chains are being reshaped by geopolitical tensions, decarbonization mandates, and the race to control critical minerals. Amid this turmoil, Australia—a nation often typecast as a ""raw materials exporter""—is positioning itself to become a global leader in advanced manufacturing. Under the Albanese government's structural reforms, the country is slashing red tape, investing in tech-driven productivity, and accelerating renewable energy integration. This trifecta of policies is priming Australia to capitalize on the $12 trillion global reshoring opportunity, with sectors like green steel, advanced manufacturing, and energy infrastructure emerging as prime investment frontiers.

Structural Reforms: Cutting Red Tape to Ignite Manufacturing Momentum

Australia's manufacturing sector has long been hamstrung by regulatory inefficiencies. The Albanese government's targeted reforms aim to dismantle these barriers. Key actions include:

- Regulatory Overhaul: Mandating agencies like the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and Australian Energy Regulator (AER) to streamline compliance processes, potentially saving businesses billions in administrative costs.

- Labor Market Flexibility: Banning non-compete clauses for low- to middle-income earners—a move projected to boost GDP by $5 billion annually—and establishing a national licensing scheme for electrical workers, reducing labor mobility barriers.

- Productivity Fund Incentives: A $2 billion National Productivity Fund is driving efficiency gains in construction and infrastructure, critical for housing and energy projects.

These reforms are already bearing fruit. The 2025 budget's focus on reducing compliance costs for small businesses (despite criticism over tax changes) aligns with a broader strategy: lowering the cost of doing business to attract global manufacturers.

Tech-Driven Productivity: The AI and Data Edge

Australia's push isn't just about deregulation—it's about reimagining manufacturing with technology. The Albanese government has prioritized:

- AI Integration: Investing in skills programs to ensure workers adapt to AI-driven automation, positioning Australia as a hub for smart manufacturing.

- Data Infrastructure: Expanding the National Broadband Network (NBN) and digital platforms like Services Australia to reduce bureaucratic drag on firms.

- Innovation Commercialization: Supporting startups and R&D in sectors like robotics and advanced materials through the $2 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).

The results? Companies like BlueScope Steel (BSL) are leveraging AI to optimize production lines, while firms like Worley (WOR) are using digital twins to design energy-efficient factories. This tech edge is critical for winning global contracts in industries like aerospace and automotive.

Renewable Energy: The Green Steel Opportunity

The heart of Australia's manufacturing resurgence lies in its pivot to green steel and clean energy infrastructure. The government's $3 billion allocation to green metals production, paired with CEFC's $6 billion private investment target, is creating a blueprint for decarbonized manufacturing:

- Green Steel Hubs: Projects like Fortescue Metals Group's (FMG) hydrogen-powered steel plant in Western Australia are capitalizing on Australia's solar and wind resources.

- Critical Minerals Dominance: Australia's lithium, nickel, and rare earth reserves position it to supply batteries and EV components, with policies like the “Future Made in Australia” initiative locking in local processing.

- Energy Infrastructure Boom: The Victorian government's wind farm approval handbook and the Net Zero Economy Authority's job transition plans ensure supply chains for renewables are locally anchored.

Critics point to controversies, like the Woodside gas project extension, which risks undermining net-zero credibility. Yet the broader trend is undeniable: investors backing green steel and renewable tech firms are likely to outperform those clinging to carbon-intensive industries.

Global Supply Chain Shifts: Why Australia Wins

The reshoring trend—driven by U.S. and EU subsidies for domestic manufacturing—is Australia's golden opportunity. Key advantages include:

- Geopolitical Positioning: A stable democracy with access to Asia-Pacific markets and U.S. partnerships, making it a trusted hub for critical supply chains.

- Resource Endowment: Abundant renewables, minerals, and land for large-scale projects give Australia a cost advantage over competitors.

- Policy Tailwinds: The Albanese government's alignment with global decarbonization goals ensures manufacturing incentives will persist.

As part of its ongoing performance validation program for Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies recently conducted a series of real-world road tests on a rebalanced Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing driving range and battery efficiency. The Electric Truck was supplied by an authorized Canadian distributor of the Electric Truck (the ""Electric Truck Authorized Distributor"") and, as represented by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, had previously demonstrated a significantly degraded driving range of approximately 40 kilometers per full charge caused by significant natural cell imbalance caused by real-world conditions.

In response to this battery capacity performance deficiency, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies performed a battery rebalancing procedure on the Electric Truck utilizing Prototype 2.0, as initially disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 6, 2025. During the associated rebalancing trial (the ""Rebalancing Trial""), Battery X Rebalancing Technologies successfully completed a full rebalancing process on a 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack composed of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry, which had exhibited substantial imbalance attributable to real-world operating conditions. The Rebalancing Trial demonstrated complete (100%) recovery of imbalance-related capacity loss and yielded a 37.7% increase in the Rated Capacity (as defined in the June 6, 2025 news release) of the Electric Truck's battery pack.

The Results

Following completion of the rebalancing procedure, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a series of controlled real-world performance evaluations (each, a ""Trial"" and collectively, the ""Battery Range Performance Trials"") on the Electric Truck for the purpose of assessing post-rebalancing improvements in battery range and overall energy efficiency under actual operating conditions. In the first Trial, the Electric Truck traveled a total distance of 41 kilometers, utilizing approximately 14% of its available battery capacity, while operating across a combination of highway and city driving environments. In the second Trial, the vehicle completed a distance of 107.3 kilometers while consuming approximately 35% of its battery capacity, under similarly mixed driving conditions. The third Trial, conducted exclusively under city driving conditions, demonstrated that the vehicle traveled 58.2 kilometers while utilizing approximately 21% of its available battery charge (collectively, the ""Results"").

The Results demonstrate a material improvement in the estimated driving range and effective battery capacity of the Electric Truck. Specifically, post-rebalancing performance testing indicates an estimated driving range of approximately 295 kilometers per full charge under no-load conditions. These figures represent an increase of up to 255 kilometers in driving range under no-load conditions, corresponding to an approximately 637.5% improvement of battery driving range, as compared to the pre-rebalancing range of approximately 40 kilometers. The Results affirm the technical efficacy and commercial relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing process and support its broader applicability within light-duty electric vehicle fleets and other commercial electric transportation use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 kilometers. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Battery Range Performance Trials yielded an estimated range of approximately 295 kilometers under no-load conditions following rebalancing. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Battery Range Performance Trials were performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.

These performance outcomes further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide compelling technical validation in support of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Significance of Results & Market Opportunity for the Electric Truck

The Results of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials collectively demonstrate that Prototype 2.0 is capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only validate the technical efficacy of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Company's patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Battery Range Performance Trials further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of aging battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Electric Truck and associated Electric Truck battery pack were supplied to Battery X Rebalancing Technologies at no cost for testing and evaluation by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, who advised that it owns and operates a fleet of approximately 20 Electric Trucks (the ""Electric Truck Fleet""). According to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, multiple vehicles within the Electric Truck Fleet have exhibited material battery degradation and capacity loss attributable to cell imbalance. The Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials were undertaken in response to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's request for a viable alternative to full battery replacement, which it advised may be financially prohibitive on a fleet-wide basis.

The objective of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials was to determine whether Prototype 2.0 could effectively restore functional battery performance in a degraded battery unit sourced from the Electric Truck Fleet. Upon successful rebalancing, the Battery Range Performance Trials further aimed to quantify the extent of recovered battery capacity in terms of estimated driving range. The positive Results are expected to inform and support ongoing discussions with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor regarding the potential deployment of the rebalancing solution across its broader fleet, with the goal of extending battery life and mitigating the operational and financial impact of premature battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor that a substantial number of similar electric trucks are currently in operation across various markets, including those held by the Electric Truck's parent company, authorized distributors, commercial fleet operators, and private owners. Many of these vehicles are reportedly experiencing battery degradation symptoms consistent with cell imbalance. This feedback underscores a broader market opportunity for Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to provide a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution aimed at extending battery life and reducing total cost of ownership for commercial EV stakeholders.

In conjunction with the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is currently advancing the development of standardized operating procedures (""SOPs"") tailored to the Electric Truck Battery Pack, in addition to refining user interface and workflow enhancements within Prototype 2.0. The Company is also actively pursuing a commercial manufacturing agreement to support scalable production and deployment of its rebalancing platform. These activities are intended to further the Company's broader commercialization strategy, which is not limited to any single third-party opportunity. The Electric Truck-specific SOPs, however, are being developed in direct response to the successful Battery Range Performance Trials and the interest expressed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor.

There can be no assurance that Battery X Rebalancing Technologies will enter into any definitive commercial arrangement with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor or any other third party at this time. While the Company remains encouraged by the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, which demonstrate an apparent need in the marketplace, any future commercial arrangement will be subject to further technical validation, negotiation of mutually acceptable terms, and completion of all necessary operational readiness milestones.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 20231. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units2, a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage3,4. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements5.

I am speaking on behalf of myself as a resident and commissioner of Hancock County, and not on behalf of the county commission as a whole. The views expressed here are my own. Personally, I want to ensure Hancock County landowners are aware of the risks associated with signing carbon capture leases with Tenaska and their CO2 sequestration ‘plans.’ If the process of capturing carbon and putting it back into storage cavities in our earth sounds like a really bad idea, that’s because it is. Please research the proven and documented environmental issues associated with CO2 sequestration wells, either in the storage cavities themselves or the pipelines carrying the waste. While carbon sequestration didn’t originate with the Biden Administration, it really ramped up heavy with Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which committed billions to carbon capture subsidies with huge tax credits given to companies along with the vastly increased rates per metric ton of capture and storage. Tenaska themselves received nearly 70 million.

Even if it can be proven that this process is safe and reliable, which it isn’t, it’s still a bad deal for Hancock County. From a financial perspective, we will not be able to harvest our natural resources in the future. The shallow Marcellus and the deeper Utica will be off limits. Section 2.4 in their lease gives that authority of approval to Tenaska. ‘The Limitation of Further Encumbrances’ section addresses the issue of permanently protecting the integrity of the deep subsurface. With Tenaska’s plan, with our earth full of CO2, future fracking and drilling can and will disturb the plates and cavities containing CO2, allowing for its escape. Even if Tenaska would ‘approve’, I have articles where heads of oil and gas companies state that when CO2 is mixed with any type of saltwater brine, which is the plan with cavity storage, it produces a very toxic fume which corrodes piping at an extreme rate. Even if ‘allowed’, this all but eliminates small and mid size companies from coming to Hancock to drill. They can’t afford it. And the big monster companies who have the funds won’t come either, because the precautions and extra efforts will substantially eat into their profits. They’ll just go to another state or county where they don’t have to deal with carbon capture.

In my opinion, carbon capture could cause serious, substantial environmental issues. And it critically hinders, if not outright eliminates, our future prosperity that our natural resources give us. The small financial gain they are offering is less than 1% of what oil and gas leases were at their peak. If we want a thriving Hancock County with all options on the table, the possibility of a natural resource hub with our oil and gas under our control, and to attract companies with their jobs and subsequent increased tax base with them, we’ll need the ability to harvest our natural resources. Please study Tenaska’s lease, and/or take it to an attorney. Is the small, up front, 1% gain worth all the long term environmental risks and the jeopardizing of our future financial prosperity? In my opinion…NO.

A generation of scientific talent is at the brink of being lost to overseas competitors by the Trump administration’s dismantling of the National Science Foundation (NSF), with unprecedented political interference at the agency jeopardizing the future of US industries and economic growth, according to a Guardian investigation.

The gold standard peer-reviewed process used by the NSF to support cutting-edge, high-impact science is being undermined by the chaotic cuts to staff, programs and grants, as well as meddling by the so-called department of government efficiency (DOGE), according to multiple current and former NSF employees who spoke with the Guardian.

The scientists warn that Trump’s assault on diversity in science is already eroding the quality of fundamental research funded at the NSF, the premier federal investor in basic science and engineering, which threatens to derail advances in tackling existential threats to food, water and biodiversity in the US.

“Before Trump, the review process was based on merit and impact. Now, it’s like rolling the dice because a DOGE person has the final say,” said one current program officer. “There has never in the history of NSF been anything like this. It’s disgusting what we’re being instructed to do.”

Another program officer said: “The exact details of the extra step is opaque but I can say with high confidence that people from DOGE or its proxies are scrutinizing applications with absolutely devastating consequences. The move amounts to the US willingly conceding global supremacy to competitors like China in biological, social and physical sciences. It is a mind-boggling own-goal.”

The NSF, founded in 1950, is the only federal agency that funds fundamental research across all fields of science and engineering, and which over the years has contributed to major breakthroughs in organ transplants, gene technology, AI, smartphones and the internet, extreme weather and other hazard warning systems, American sign language, cybersecurity and even the language app Duolingo.

In normal times, much of the NSF budget ($9 billion in 2024/25) is allocated to research institutions after projects undergo a rigorous three-step review process—beginning with the program officer, an expert in the field, who ensures the proposed study fits in with the agency’s priorities. The program officer convenes an expert panel to evaluate the proposal on two statutory criteria—intellectual merit and broader impacts on the nation and people—which under the NSF’s legal mandate includes broadening participation of individuals, institutions, and geographic regions in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).

Applications from across the country that are greenlighted by the program officer are almost always funded, though may be subject to tweaks after revision by the division director before the grants directorate allocates the budget.

That was before Trump. Now, DOGE personnel can veto any study without explanation, the Guardian has confirmed.

“We are under pressure to only fund proposals that fit the new narrow priorities, even if they did not review as well as others,” said one current program officer. “The NSF’s gold standard review process has 100 percent been compromised.”

Research aimed at addressing the unequal impact of the climate crisis and other environmental hazards is particularly vulnerable, according to several sources. New proposals are also being screened for any direct reference or indirect connection to diversity, equity or inclusion (DEI).

“NSF is being asked to make science racist again—which contradicts evidence that shows that diversity of ideas is good for science and good for innovation. We are missing things when only white males do science,” said one program officer.

In addition to DOGE interfering in new proposals, at least 1,653 active NSF research grants authorized on their merits have so far been abruptly cancelled—abandoned midway through the project, according to Grant Watch, a nonprofit tracker of federal science and health research grants canceled under Trump.

Multiple NSF scientists who oversee a diverse range of NSF programs described the grant cancellations as “unprecedented,” “arbitrary,” and a “colossal waste of taxpayer money.”

Almost 60 percent of the projects abandoned are in states which voted for Joe Biden in 2024, Guardian analysis found. More than one in nine cancelled grants—12 percent of the total—were at Harvard University, which Trump has particularly targeted since coming to power in January.

In addition, studies deemed to be violating Trump’s executive orders on DEI and environmental justice—regardless of their scientific merit, potential impact or urgency—are being abruptly terminated at particularly high rates.

It’s not uncommon for the NSF and other federal research agencies to shift focus to reflect a new administration’s priorities. Amid mounting evidence on the crucial role of diversity in innovation and science, Biden priorities included increased effort to tackle inequalities across the STEM workforce—and a commitment to target underserved communities most affected by the climate crisis and environmental harms.

Trump’s priorities are AI, quantum information science, nuclear, biotech, and translational research. “It’s normal that a new administration will emphasize some areas, de-emphasize others, and we would gradually transition to new priorities. During the George W. Bush administration there were shenanigans around climate change, but it was nothing like this kind of meddling in the scientific review process. You never just throw proposals in the garbage can,” said one current NSF staffer.

“Our mandate is to advance science and innovation. And we just can’t do that if we’re not thinking about diversifying the STEM workforce. We don’t have enough people or diversity of thought without broadening participation—which is part of the NSF mission mandate,” said a former program officer from the Directorate for Computer and Information Science who recently accepted a buyout.

“It has been soul-sucking to see projects that went through the review process being changed or terminated over and over again,” they added.

The Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150 percent to 300 percent over the past 75 years, meaning US taxpayers have gotten back between $1.50 and $3 for every dollar invested.

Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” includes a 56 percent cut to the current $9 billion NSF budget, as well as a 73 percent reduction in staff and fellowships, with graduate students among the hardest hit.

Last week, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that it will be moving into the NSF headquarters in Virginia over the course of the next two years. The shock announcement—which did not include any plans on relocating more than 1,800 NSF employees—has triggered speculation that the administration eventually plans to defund the agency entirely.

For now, program officers are also being instructed to return research proposals to scientists and institutions “without review”—regardless of merit and despite having been submitted in response to specific NSF solicitations to address gaps in scientific and engineering knowledge around some of the most pressing concerns in the US. This includes projects that have in fact undergone review, and others which can no longer be processed due to staff and program cuts, according to multiple NSF sources.

In one case, a 256-page proposal by scientists at four public universities to use ancient DNA records to better forecast biodiversity loss as the planet warms was apparently archived without consideration.

In an email seen by the Guardian, the NSF told Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist and principal investigator (lead scientist) based at the University of Maine, that all proposals submitted to the Biology Integration Institute program were returned without review. A second email said their specific proposal had been “administratively screened” and the area of proposed study was “inappropriate for NSF funding.”

An estimated 40 percent of animals and 34 percent of plants across the US are currently at risk. The proposed study would have used an emerging technology to extract ancient DNA from lake sediments, ice cores, and cave deposits to better understand which species fared better or worse when the planet naturally warmed thousands of years ago—in order to help model and protect biodiversity in the face of human-made climate change.

Gill told the Guardian the team took great care to avoid any reference to DEI or climate change. The grant would have created much-needed research capacity in the US, which is lagging behind Europe in this field.

“Ancient DNA records allow you to reconstruct entire ecosystems at a very high level. This is a very new and emerging science, and grants like this help catalyze the research and reinvest in US infrastructure and workforce in ways that have huge returns on investments for their local economies. It’s an absolute slap in the face that the proposal was returned without review,” Gill said.

In another example, two academic institutions chosen to receive prestigious $15m grants for translational research—a Trump priority—after a 30-month cross-agency review process led by the engineering directorate and involving hundreds of people will not be honored.

The proposals selected for the award through merit review will be returned without review for being “inappropriate for NSF funding,” the Guardian understands.

“This is complex, very high-impact translation science to achieve sustainability across cities and regions and industries…we’re being instructed to put the principal investigators off, but nothing’s going to get funded because there’s DEI in this program,” said an NSF employee with knowledge of the situation.

Meanwhile scores of other proposals approved on merit by program officers are disappearing into a “black box”—languishing for weeks or months without a decision or explanation, which was leading some to “self-censor,” according to NSF staff.

“It’s either NSF staff self-censoring to make sure they don’t get into trouble, or it is censorship by somebody inserted in the scientific review process from DOGE. Either way it’s a political step, and therefore problematic,” said Anne Marie Schmoltner, a program officer in the chemistry division who retired in February after 30 years in the agency.

In addition to distributing funds to seasoned researchers, the NSF supports students and up-and-coming scientists and engineers through fellowships, research opportunities and grants.

This next generation of talent is being hit particularly hard under Trump, who is attempting to impose sweeping restrictions on visas and travel bans on scores of countries. The proposed 2026 budget includes funding for only 21,400 under- and postgraduate students nationwide—a 75 percent reduction from this year.

Like many scientists across the country, Gill, the paleoecologist, is not accepting new graduate students this fall due to funding uncertainty. “That’s a whole generation of young scientists who see no pathway into the field for them. I cannot stress enough how deeply upsetting and demoralizing these cuts are to a community of people who only ever wanted to solve problems and be of use.”

Yet the NSF student pipeline provides experts for the oil and gas, mining, chemical, big tech and other industries which support Trump, in addition to academic and government-funded agencies.

“Industry is working on optimizing what they’re doing right now, whereas NSF is looking 10, 20 years down the road. The US wants a global, robust economy and for that you need innovation, and for innovation you need the fundamental research funded by the NSF,” said Schmoltner.

The NSF declined to comment, referring instead to the agency website last updated in April which states: ‘The principles of merit, competition, equal opportunity and excellence are the bedrock of the NSF mission. NSF continues to review all projects using Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts criteria.’

The sweeping cuts to the NSF come on top of Trump’s dismantling of other key scientific research departments within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and US Geological Service (USGS).

The USGS is the research arm of the Department of Interior. Its scientists help solve real-life problems about hazards, natural resources, water, energy, ecosystems, and the impacts of climate and land-use change for tribal governments, the Bureau of Land Management, fish and wildlife services, and the National Parks Service, among other interior agencies.

Trump’s big, beautiful bill cuts the USGS budget by 39 percent. This includes slashing the entire budget for the agency’s ecosystems mission area (EMA), which leads federal research on species & ecosystems and houses the climate adaptation science centers.

EMA scientists figure out how to better protect at-risk species such as bees and wolverines, minimize harmful overgrazing on BLM lands, and prevent invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes—all vitally important to protect food security in the US as the climate changes.

The EMA has already lost 25 to 30 percent of employees through DOGE-approved layoffs and buyouts, and is now facing termination. “We’ve already lost a lot of institutional memory and new, up-and-coming leaders. [Under Trump’s budget], all science in support of managing our public lands and natural resources [will] be cut,” said one USGS program officer.

“Our economy is driven by natural resources including timber, minerals, and food systems, and if we don’t manage these in a sustainable way, we will be shooting ourselves in the foot.”

Like at the NSF, the USGC’s gold standard peer-review system for research approval and oversight is now at the mercy of DOGE—in this case Tyler Hasson, the former oil executive given sweeping authority by the Interior secretary. According to USGS staff, Hasson’s office accepts or rejects proposals based on two paragraphs of information program officers are permitted to submit, without any dialogue or feedback. “The gold standard scientific review is being interfered with. This is now a political process,” said one USGS scientist.

A spokesperson for the Interior department said: “The claim that science is being ‘politicized’ is categorically false. We reject the narrative that responsible budget reform constitutes an ‘assault on science’. On the contrary, we are empowering American innovation by cutting red tape, reducing bureaucracy and ensuring that the next generation of scientists and engineers can focus on real-world solutions—not endless paperwork or politically motivated research agendas.”
