The Energy Department will make up to $60 million available for two additional critical mineral programs, the agency said in an Aug. 25 release.

One program aims to support organizations developing technologies to shorten the evaluation timeline for ore deposits. The other focuses on using AI and high-throughput experimentation to create new types of rare earth magnets, the release said.

“Developing faster, more accurate resource evaluation tools, and creating a new more powerful class of magnetic materials will enable America to unlock domestic reserves, strengthen supply chains, and enhance U.S. energy and economic security,” Daniel Cunningham, acting director of the department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy, said in the release.

Dive Insight:

The programs comply with President Donald Trump’s March 20 Executive Order to develop U.S. critical mineral resources. The order seeks to reduce the country’s reliance on foreign nations for materials necessary for domestic and military manufacturing.

The Energy Department launched the latest round of Notice of Funding Opportunity two weeks after making nearly $1 billion available for projects that advance and expand mining, processing and manufacturing technologies for critical minerals.

The DOE allocated $40 million to the Reliable Ore Characterization with Keystone Sensing program. The funding targets the development of advanced drilling, sensing, and analytical technologies that cut the time needed to evaluate ore deposits from years to months.

The department dedicated the remaining $20 million in funding to the Magnetic Acceleration Generating New Innovations and Tactical Outcomes program. The financing will support the development of novel magnetic materials with new chemistries and microstructures, per the DOE.

The MAGNITO funding targets organizations employing AI, machine learning and high-throughput experimentation, the DOE said. The latter refers to research techniques that use automated systems and parallel processing to conduct large numbers of experiments simultaneously or in rapid succession.

Last year the Bureau of Land Management said in 2022, the two mines had produced about two-thirds the coal they produced in 2007.
“Under the Biden Administration, BLM’s proposal would have rendered Montana’s coal resources useless, depriving Montana schools and other institutions of a critical funding source,” Gianforte wrote.
“It will also stifle our state’s growing economy and increase our dependence on foreign nations for coal and energy production.
It’s critical that we remove this outdated and harmful plan.” Downing’s office said overturning the resource management plan will keep roughly $46 million in coal tax revenue secure and generate $15 million in new federal energy revenue.","The U.S. House last week passed a resolution overturning Biden-era restrictions on resource extraction across millions of acres in eastern Montana, bringing Montana’s all-Republican delegation closer to stated goals of bolstering the state’s mining and energy sectors.

But conservation groups said the change — which needs approval in the U.S. Senate — reverses environmental gains and ignores local stakeholders

House Joint Resolution 104, carried by the state’s eastern Congressman, Rep. Troy Downing, passed on near-partisan lines, with all but one Republican in favor and all Democrats opposed.

“The Biden Administration’s outright ban on coal leasing in the Powder River Basin is an intolerable threat to domestic energy production, U.S. national security, and the prosperity of the communities I represent,” Downing said in a statement. “I’m proud to be leading the charge in the House to reverse the Miles City Field Office RMPA to improve access to the affordable, reliable energy that brings the American dream that much closer to hand for countless families in Montana and across the country. I appreciate the support and advocacy of my colleagues from the Treasure State in this fight, and I look forward to seeing this resolution pass the Senate and signed into law by President Trump.”

All four of Montana’s congressional delegates, all Republicans, support the resolution, with Sen. Steve Daines sponsoring companion legislation in the upper chamber. Rep. Ryan Zinke and Sen. Tim Sheehy are cosponsors on their chambers’ respective bills.

The bill was one of three passed by the House last Wednesday rescinding resource management plans on nearly 30 million acres of public land in Montana, North Dakota and Alaska.

Downing’s legislation overturns a rule issued by the Bureau of Land Management that halted future coal leasing on roughly 1.7 million acres of federal land in Montana’s Powder River Basin, which contains roughly a third of the nation’s coal reserves.

The record of decision for the Miles City Resource Management Plan amendment, released last November, provided for existing leases at two mines — Spring Creek and Rosebud — to continue for at least a decade, but the bureau said the rule came following analysis that coal markets would continue to decline and coal-fired plants were likely to close or be converted to utilize renewable energy.

“The approved RMP Amendment makes unavailable 1,745,040 acres of BLM administered coal from further consideration for leasing in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a proxy for climate change. The BLM would not accept new coal lease applications,” the decision said.

Last year the Bureau of Land Management said in 2022, the two mines had produced about two-thirds the coal they produced in 2007.

Meanwhile, the federal government earlier this year authorized an expansion for the Westmoreland Rosebud Mine, which fuels the Colstrip power plant, allowing it to extract roughly 70 million tons of coal and operate through 2039.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects U.S. coal production to drop from 610 million tons in 2022 to 450 million tons in 2040, and Western U.S. production to drop from 335 million tons to 224 million tons over the same period.

Coal taxes in Montana benefit public education in the state, with money going into a trust that funds public school construction and upgrades, infrastructure projects, housing and economic development, among other things.

In a letter sent to the Trump administration, Gov. Greg Gianforte urged the federal government to maximize the availability of federal coal in Montana to benefit national security, provide reliable energy and boost Montana’s educational systems.

“Under the Biden Administration, BLM’s proposal would have rendered Montana’s coal resources useless, depriving Montana schools and other institutions of a critical funding source,” Gianforte wrote. “Montana’s schools and public institutions need a good partner in BLM, and it is imperative that the agency embrace the opportunity to maximize the development opportunities for coal resources in Montana.

While industry groups and Montana politicians praised the passage of the bill conservation groups decried the move as a step backwards for environmental protections and criticized Congress’ vote as a workaround of the federal rule-making process.

“Congress just jumped head first down a slippery slope that creates a dangerous precedent that will surely backfire. Using the Congressional Review Act not only repeals the current management plan, which was carefully crafted by local leaders and stakeholders, but it puts at risk future efforts to responsibly manage public lands. It’s not just wildlife habitat and hunting and fishing access at risk here; it’s all decisions made at the local level,” said Frank Szollosi, executive director of the Montana Wildlife Federation, in a statement. “At a time when Montana’s public lands are facing numerous threats, land managers need flexibility and tools to respond, not more interference from Washington.”

Justin Meuse, government relations director at The Wilderness Society, said Congress was overturning decisions over land management in an “unprecedented way” and could expose “thousands of permits, leases and rights of way to legal challenge.”

But Daines emphasized that Montana’s economy was at the forefront of his decision to back the move.

“Joe Biden’s Miles City RMPA halts all future coal leasing in the region and will cause hardworking Montanans to lose their jobs,” Daines said in a statement. “It will also stifle our state’s growing economy and increase our dependence on foreign nations for coal and energy production. It’s critical that we remove this outdated and harmful plan.”

President Trump can’t be blamed for the current rise in energy prices.","President Donald Trump has been racing at breakneck speed to keep all his campaign promises. Yet he has only four months left to fulfill his vow to halve electricity prices by the end of his first year. Fighting against the fallout of the Biden administration’s harmful anti-fossil fuel agenda, the president faces stiff headwinds. The only way the president can meet his self-imposed deadline is to change course quickly, reject Biden’s mistakes and unlock the potential of every available electron.

So far, the trend lines aren’t looking good. In the last year, electricity prices have risen twice as fast as inflation, and the Energy Information Administration estimates that retail electricity prices will continue to outpace inflation through next year, with residential prices surging between 13% to 18% higher than in 2022.

Though, traditionally, consumers have been much more concerned about gas prices — a number they see projected on highway signs and experience firsthand multiple times a month at the pump — the experience of electricity price spikes instead of the promised price cuts will risk diminishing Trump’s popular support.

‘WEB OF DARK MONEY’ TIED TO OBAMA, DEMS FUELS GREEN OPPOSITION TO CRUCIAL TRUMP ENERGY PLAN

What’s worse, these price hikes will arrive before the midterms, when Trump will be battling to retain his slim congressional majorities.

The current price hikes aren’t Trump’s fault. Instead, he inherited a market with increasing and unprecedented energy demand coupled with the fallout from the Biden administration’s harmful policies to phase out fossil fuels.

Technological innovations like cloud and quantum computing, crypto mining, electric vehicle adoption, streaming services and, most of all, AI data centers, all have tremendous energy demands, which drive electricity prices higher. Rand estimates global AI data centers alone will need 327 GW of energy by 2030. To put that into perspective, the entire state of California used 86 GW of energy in 2022.

‘LEFTIST’ TAXPAYER-FUNDED ACADEMY SPARKS BACKLASH AFTER MOVING AGAINST TRUMP’S ROLLBACK OF KEY REGULATION

In the face of rising demand, the Biden administration embarked on an aggressive program to curtail legacy energy production. The Biden EPA imposed new emissions restrictions that effectively forced the retirement of coal and natural gas power plants and manipulated regulations across agencies to hem in traditional fuel sources.

If these Biden-era policies didn’t cause the current electricity price spikes, they at least allowed today’s demand-induced price increases to hit consumers unabated.

Trump now has to deal with a crisis not of his own making. With his firm commitments to win the AI race, advance crypto and reshore energy-intensive manufacturing such as semiconductor production, Trump can only keep electricity prices in check by massively increasing supply to meet rising demand.

Unfortunately, his administration appears to be repeating the same mistakes as Biden’s, just colored with a different ideology.

TRUMP BREAKS ‘DAY ONE’ PROMISE TO LOWER COSTS AS PRICES SURGE ACROSS AMERICA IN FIRST SIX MONTHS

Where the Biden administration cut energy supplies by attacking fossil fuel production, the Trump administration is limiting alternative and renewable energy sources.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

The One Big Beautiful Bill rescinds tax incentives for renewables, while the administration has advanced multiple orders and rules that limit clean energy, from halting offshore wind leases to curbing solar tax credits.

“Drill, baby, drill” is a great energy policy, but it’s not enough by itself. While America produced nearly enough energy from fossil fuels (86.3 quads) to supply our nation’s entire energy consumption (93.59 quads) in 2023, the fact is, we need alternative energy sources just to meet current demands. When the future requires even more energy, the necessity for alternative energy will only increase.

The cheapest way to put more electrons into the power grid immediately is to erect significantly more solar and energy storage infrastructure, coupled with natural gas peaker plants that can be rapidly turned on during peak hours.

WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR

In the medium term, America needs to increase nuclear energy production, build more energy infrastructure like electric transmission lines and natural gas pipelines, and construct geothermal power plants while deploying grid-enhancing technology, improving demand response and increasing energy efficiency. With the growing adoption of solar and EVs, the United States can even create an aggregated network of residential, virtual power plants that only draw energy in low-use times while feeding energy back into the grid when it’s needed most.

The point is, every energy source and efficiency measure must be deployed if we have any hope of keeping prices in check.

President Trump can’t be blamed for the current rise in energy prices. But he could be blamed down the road if his administration continues to limit supply by favoring one source of energy over others. At the end of each month, most consumers don’t care where their energy comes from; they only care that it’s cheap.

Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organization — which is the country’s largest miner of critical minerals — signed a memorandum of understanding with Missouri-based U.S. Strategic Metals for collaboration plans that include setting up a poly-metallic refinery in Pakistan.

The deal comes after Washington and Islamabad last month reached a trade agreement that Pakistan hoped would attract American investment in its minerals and oil reserves.

U.S. Strategic Metals is focused on producing and recycling critical minerals, which the U.S. Department of Energy has defined as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.

A second agreement was signed between the National Logistics Corp of Pakistan and Mota-Engil Group, a Portuguese engineering and construction company.

A statement from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office said he held talks with the delegation from U.S. Strategic Metals and Mota-Engil over Pakistan’s copper, gold, rare earths, and other mineral resources.

The sides expressed readiness to develop value-added facilities, enhance mineral processing capacity, and undertake large-scale projects tied to mining, the statement said.

“The partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten, and rare earth elements,” it added.

The U.S. embassy in Pakistan said in a statement: “This signing is yet another example of the strength of the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral relationship that will benefit both countries.”

Earlier this year, Sharif claimed that Pakistan possesses mineral reserves worth trillions of dollars, and foreign investment in the mineral sector could help the country overcome its prolonged financial crisis and free itself from the burden of massive foreign loans.

Most of Pakistan’s mineral wealth is located in the insurgency-hit southwestern Balochistan province, where separatists have opposed the extraction of resources by Pakistani and foreign firms.

In August, the U.S. State Department had designated the Balochistan National Army separatist group and its fighting wing, the Majeed Brigade, as a foreign terrorist organization.

Oil and minerals reserves have also been found in the southern Sindh, eastern Punjab and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bordering Afghanistan.

Permitting reform is essential to advancing energy projects and unlocking lower costs, more jobs, and stronger communities. In a recent blog, Brent Gardner, Chief Government Affairs Officer at Americans for Prosperity, emphasized the urgent need for reform and the rare bipartisan opportunity to finally get it done.

More from the post here:

It doesn’t happen often, but sometimes Republicans and Democrats agree.

And when it comes to America’s permitting system, both sides of the aisle know it’s broken.

That consensus matters because the problem urgently needs to be fixed.

Approvals for critical projects that should take weeks or months routinely drag on for years, mired in red tape and lawsuits.

As President Biden’s senior advisor, John Podesta, said in 2023, “We got so good at stopping projects, we forgot how to build things in America.”

THE COST OF DELAY

This broken system has real-world consequences.

Rising energy costs are squeezing American families and businesses — showing up in higher utility bills, pricier commutes, and the cost of everyday goods across the economy.

Affordable energy powered America’s rise in the 20th century, fueling innovation and economic growth. But today, outdated rules put us at risk of falling behind.

Electricity doesn’t simply appear in our homes and businesses. It requires a vast and complex generation, transmission, and distribution supply chain that often needs upgrades to keep up with ever-growing demand.

And demand is soaring. Electric vehicles, data centers, and the AI revolution are pushing America’s power grid to its limits.

AI alone requires massive amounts of reliable power for data centers and high-performance computing. Our outdated permitting system simply won’t allow us to keep up with the demand, which threatens our ability to lead on this critical new technology.

At the same time, reliable coal and fossil fuel plants that provide steady baseload power are being retired faster than replacements can come online.

Without reform, the infrastructure needed to expand grid capacity and bring new generation to market will remain unbuilt, leaving the country less secure, less competitive, and without reliable power.

THE WAY FORWARD

Permitting reform is the key to clearing the way for energy projects and unlocking lower costs, more jobs, and stronger communities.

While lawmakers have long recognized that unnecessary self-imposed federal regulations are holding back America’s energy potential, they never anticipated how quickly technology and innovation would make solving this problem mission critical for our economy and global competitiveness.

That’s why momentum is finally building across party lines to get it done.

Permitting reform is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to work together to deliver a rare, bipartisan win for the American people. Outdated rules are blocking progress on building pipelines, renewable energy facilities, nuclear plants, transmission lines, and storage projects.

The question is no longer whether the system is broken. It’s whether Washington will finally rise to the occasion and fix it.

SECURING THE FUTURE

Majority Leader Steve Scalise is betting that it can.

He has made permitting reform a top priority this fall, putting real weight behind the effort to modernize America’s energy policies and clear the way for projects that can power the future.

Energy is the foundation of America’s prosperity and security.

As Leader Scalise put it, “American energy provides us national security and really leads us to global leadership that the whole world wants to see. … We know the ability America has to unleash American energy if we just get red tape out of the way.”

He’s right. If Washington clears the way, America can unleash its energy potential and lead the world.

Permitting reform is no longer optional. It’s essential.

Families need relief from high energy costs, businesses need reliable power, and America needs the capacity to compete and lead.

For once, there is bipartisan agreement on the problem and the need for a solution.

That rare consensus gives Congress the chance to rise above politics and deliver a win that matters: affordable, reliable American energy that fuels growth, strengthens communities, and secures our future.

But it won’t happen without your help. Lawmakers need to hear that families, businesses, and communities are demanding relief. The time to act is now.

,Clean Energy ,2025-09-08 21:42:51+00:00,The Business Journal,"In LA port, bobbing blue floats are turning wave power into clean energy",Ben Hensley,,,,,https://thebusinessjournal.com/in-la-port-bobbing-blue-floats-are-turning-wave-power-into-clean-energy/,"This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating.
The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain.
Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.
Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully.","On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

,EVs,2025-09-08 21:37:23+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Rivian lays off hundreds of employees ahead of the end of EV tax credits,"Cerys Davies, www.latimes.com, cerys-davies",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-09-08/rivian-lays-off-employees-new-suv-tax-credits,"Rivian is among the many car companies bracing for the changes in federal tax credits.
At this price level, Rivian will be able to compete with other EV companies such as Tesla, which also has a model starting at about $45,000.
Like all EV companies, it is now struggling with policy changes out of Washington.
Because Rivian makes only EVs, the company’s sales have been derailed with changes in compliance credits.
Previously, the company would sell these credits to other car companies that needed to meet fuel economy and emission standards.","Rivian has laid off about 200 employees as the electric vehicle maker prepares for a U.S. economy with fewer incentives to go green.

The electric truck and sport-utility vehicle manufacturer is preparing for a challenging year in which it plans to launch a more affordable model even as it gets more expensive to buy an EV.

A spokesperson at the company said that the layoffs are equivalent to about 1.5% of its total staff of nearly 15,000. The Wall Street Journal first reported the layoffs.

Rivian is among the many car companies bracing for the changes in federal tax credits.

Under President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, the $7,500 tax credit, which some buyers receive for purchasingEVs, is set to expire at the end of this month. The credit of up to $4,000 for used EVs also will end.

It’s an abrupt reversal of Biden-era efforts to address climate change emissions from gasoline cars.

Transportation is the most significant source of climate-warming emissions in California and the U.S., and experts warn that the sector must become far cleaner to avoid the worst effects of global warming.

In California, approximately one-quarter of new cars sold are either fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, according to the California Energy Commission.

That progress could stall. The planned phaseout of state credits is expected to dampen EV sales, which already have slowed due to waning consumer interest and high tariffs on imported cars.

Anticipating a slowdown in demand as the incentives end, General Motors has laid off 360 workers in Detroit due to the slowed production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ. Volkswagen plans to temporarily furlough 160 employees and slow production of its electric SUV.

Rivian’s newest model, the R2 SUV, is slated to come out next year.

“We have made some recent changes to the Commercial team as part of an ongoing effort to improve operational efficiency for R2,” a Rivian spokesperson wrote in a statement to The Times.

It will be one of the company’s more affordable options, starting at $45,000. Its current R1S SUV starts at $76,900. At this price level, Rivian will be able to compete with other EV companies such as Tesla, which also has a model starting at about $45,000.

Rivian first made a name for itself with its Earth-toned electric trucks, which debuted in 2018. The company was founded in Florida and moved to Irvine in 2020, where it is based today.

The introduction of its heavy-duty EVs initially appealed to more-affluent consumers, with some of the models sporting sticker prices above $120,000.

After taking the company public in 2021, the retailer has faced a number of challenges. It has had to grapple with supply chain issues, steep price points and order delays.

Like all EV companies, it is now struggling with policy changes out of Washington.

Because Rivian makes only EVs, the company’s sales have been derailed with changes in compliance credits. Previously, the company would sell these credits to other car companies that needed to meet fuel economy and emission standards.

In its second quarter, the company reported a loss of $1.1 billion.

Rivian shares have climbed about 5% this year. That’s less than half the gain of the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index for the same period.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/02534b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+230/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2F56%2Fb9b228bb470189caa3196bfeb318%2Frivian-2-trucks.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 18:03:08.899707

Significant federal tax incentives for buyers of electric vehicles are set to expire at the end of September, following passage of the Big Beautiful Bill.

Earlier this year, GM anounced Fairfax would begin production of a gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox in combination with production of the Bolt.

A spokesperson said Monday that the plant's ability to shift between internal combustion engines and electric vehicles gives the company manufacturing flexibility.

""As part of that, we made the decision to delay the return of a second shift at Fairfax,"" the company said.

While the auto company navigates uncertainties in the electric vehicle front, it remains bullish on gas.

""The recent decision to allocate the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox production to Fairfax beginning in 2027 emphasizes the strong future for the facility,"" the company said in its Monday statement to KSHB 41.

The decision, announced in June, was part of a $4 billion expansion plan at three GM plants in Orion Township, Michigan, and Spring Hill, Tennessee.

The plant recently produced the Chevrolet Malibu and Cadillac XT4.

Production of the Malibu stopped in 2024 and the Cadillac XT4 is no longer in the General Motors lineup of vehicles.

The investments include a previously announced $457 million power transformer factory in South Boston, Virginia, which will be the largest in the US, and expansions of Hitachi Energy’s existing facilities throughout the country. The company says the investments will create thousands of US jobs, including $825 million at the Virginia site alone.

The Trump administration released its AI Action Plan in June, calling for streamlining permitting and environmental reviews for data center projects, along with power grid improvements that focus on natural gas, coal, geothermal and nuclear sources. The focus on fossil fuels and exclusion of incentives for wind and solar energy sources drew significant criticism from environmental groups.

AI Driving Unprecedented Data Center Demand

Companies pouring billions into AI adoption are creating unprecedented data center demand. A McKinsey & Company report says businesses will invest $6.7 trillion on data centers globally by 2030, with almost $3 trillion going to real estate and power infrastructure.

Steven Dickens, CEO and principal analyst at HyperFrame Research told Data Center Knowledge that more data center energy deals should be expected, as local governments look to capitalize on demand.

“I expect to see locally elected representatives clamoring to ink these types of deals, as they provide a rapid way to demonstrate innovation and bring long-term tech jobs to their regions,” he said in an email interview.

“The longer-term power implications for local communities are less transparent, and many areas will need significant investment in power generation infrastructure to keep up with rampant demand. The US will need to invest in natural gas, and more pertinently, nuclear, to keep up.”

Powering Up for Growth

Hitachi said the investments, part of a $9 billion global investment plan, would also bolster domestic electrical equipment supply chains while boosting technologies to support security and resilience for the US power grid.

“The United States is a key market for Hitachi, and this investment reflects our commitment to powering America’s energy future to meet the accelerating demands for reliable and sustainable solutions to benefit the nation,” Toshiaki Tokunaga, president and CEO of Hitachi, said in a statement.

“We are supporting American manufacturing, the development of critical infrastructure, and the rapid expansion of data centers driven by AI adoption.”

Hitachi Energy, a subsidiary of Japan’s Hitachi, has headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Zurich, Switzerland.

“Bringing production of large power transformers to the US is critical to building a strong domestic supply chain for the US economy and recuing production bottlenecks, which is essential as demand for these transformers across the economy is surging,” Hitachi Energy CEO Andreas Schierenbeck said in a statement.

“Power transformers are a linchpin technology for a robust and reliable electric grid and winning the AI race.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt8eb3cdfc1fce5194/bltdebc235f47f54f8f/68bf44a06a5e75d07187235a/Hitachi-Energy-South-Boston.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-08 18:04:26.090333

“October will be an interesting month as people adjust to whatever this new level of EV sales turns out to be.
But as I look at our performance around Cadillac today, the industry runs about 14% electric in the luxury space.
Whether it’s EVs or the “quite strong” sales of the CT4 and CT5, Roth is optimistic about where Cadillac is headed.","Cadillac is having a good year. As of mid-August, annual sales are higher than they’ve been in the last 18 years. A big part of that, no doubt, is fresh metal in the showroom. A refreshed Escalade, plus the Optiq, Lyriq, and Vistiq electric SUVs are driving sales among conquest customers, many of them in younger demographics than Cadillac has recently reached. Global Vice-President of Cadillac, John Roth, took the top seat at the brand in 2023; when we spoke last month at Monterey Car Week, he stressed that the transformation is a decade in the making.

“You’ve got to walk back to 2015, when there was a whole lot of work put into a vision plan, which is the product portfolio that we have today,” Roth explained. “The idea at that time was not only that we’d make some great EVs, but also that there would be a big investment in the V series brand and making statements there, but really doing truly ground-up Cadillacs from a [full] portfolio standpoint. Then you bundle around making sure our dealer network was well-trained, having the right locations, redoing our image facilities, updating all the advertising creative that was wrapped around these vehicles. And so you start to build this bigger strategy and bundle around a massive launch of vehicles that are all coming right now.”

The recent rush of EV sales, no doubt, can be attributed to the planned rollback of the $7500 federal incentive, set to expire on September 30. General Motors said that August was its best-ever sales month for electric vehicles, with more than 21,000 examples delivered across Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC. Naturally, other automakers are experiencing the same urgency: Automotive News reported that Ford Mustang Mach-E sales increased 35 percent last month, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 was up 61 percent. J.D. Power and GlobalData figures indicate that EVs accounted for 12 percent of all retail sales in August 2025, compared with 9.5 percent in the prior August.

Roth, like everyone else, expects the frenzy to die off after September 30.

“October will be an interesting month as people adjust to whatever this new level of EV sales turns out to be. But as I look at our performance around Cadillac today, the industry runs about 14% electric in the luxury space. The general market is running around 7 or 8% electric. So luxury is running double the general market, versus Cadillac that is running on average for the calendar year about 24%. So we do have a draw for consumers who are looking for a really good Cadillac from a driving dynamic standpoint, and it shows up in the form of an EV. As we move into the fourth quarter, the industry itself may become smaller, but I think Cadillac is well positioned to maintain, if not grow market share because of the product offerings we have.”

Translation: Rougher times ahead. If the overall market is smaller, retaining the advantage you have in the space becomes even more important, and conquest sales are a reason for Roth to be confident. Optiq is boasting between 70 and 75 percent conquest sales, versus about 80 percent for the Lyriq. The customers the brand are poaching are trending younger, as well: Cadillac’s average customer age is down to about 53 years, versus 60 years back in 2015.

Formula 1 promises a new avenue to capture fresh eyeballs, Roth says. “F1 is very much a fashion statement these days. It’s much like with us being at The Quail, from a concours standpoint; it’s a chance to really be part of car culture and express what you’re going to tell the public about what you stand for from a capability standpoint. And we compete with many of the tier one luxury makes that are out there that I mentioned earlier. We compete with them in the retail world and we compete with them on the track.”

Things are definitely changing at Cadillac, but the brand did go back on its earlier ambitions to go all-electric by 2030. Gas engines are sticking around. The compact XT5 SUV will remain gas-powered when it launches as a 2027 model, and the Escalade will keep a dinosaur-burner for the foreseeable future. The CT4 and CT5 (which currently use turbo-four, turbo-six, and supercharged V-8s) are carrying on, Roth says, which gives customers “the luxury of choice” in propulsion and body style across the portfolio.

Whether it’s EVs or the “quite strong” sales of the CT4 and CT5, Roth is optimistic about where Cadillac is headed. “I think that energy is driving more energy. People are seeing cars on the road and they’re asking us or other customers who are driving ’em, ‘What is that?’ And so there’s a bit of word of mouth.”",https://media.hagerty.com/media/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cadillac-IQ-front-three-quarter-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 18:04:49.246171

U.S. Strategic Metals is focused on producing and recycling critical minerals, which the U.S. Department of Energy has defined as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.

A second agreement was signed between the National Logistics Corp of Pakistan and Mota-Engil Group, a Portuguese engineering and construction company.

A statement from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's office said he held talks with the delegation from U.S. Strategic Metals and Mota-Engil over Pakistan’s copper, gold, rare earths, and other mineral resources.

The sides expressed readiness to develop value-added facilities, enhance mineral processing capacity, and undertake large-scale projects tied to mining, the statement said.

“The partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten, and rare earth elements,” it added.

The U.S. embassy in Pakistan said in a statement: “This signing is yet another example of the strength of the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral relationship that will benefit both countries.”

Earlier this year, Sharif claimed that Pakistan possesses mineral reserves worth trillions of dollars, and foreign investment in the mineral sector could help the country overcome its prolonged financial crisis and free itself from the burden of massive foreign loans.

Most of Pakistan's mineral wealth is located in the insurgency-hit southwestern Balochistan province, where separatists have opposed the extraction of resources by Pakistani and foreign firms.

In August, the U.S. State Department had designated the Balochistan National Army separatist group and its fighting wing, the Majeed Brigade, as a foreign terrorist organization.

Oil and minerals reserves have also been found in the southern Sindh, eastern Punjab and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bordering Afghanistan.

Several companies have already signed agreements with Pakistan in the mining sector. They included the Canadian firm Barrick Gold, which already owns a 50% stake in the Reko Diq gold mine in Balochistan.",https://images.wral.com/presentation/v3/images/content/social/open_graph/wral_newcom_1920x1080.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 18:04:30.796505

How Trump’s war on climate science is weakening the US.

In late July, President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposal so bold it would have once seemed unthinkable: to reverse the endangerment finding, a legal determination under which the agency regulates planet-warming pollution. The 2009 finding rests on a vast body of scientific evidence showing greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change and threaten public health.

The agency held a public hearing on the move last month. Speaking against were activists, doctors, state officials — and business leaders such as Chris Nevers, senior director of public policy at the electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc., who called it “detrimental to the US automotive industry, consumers, and public health and welfare.”

The effort was striking, but not isolated. Around the same time, Trump proposed in his budget to shut atmospheric observatories including Mauna Loa in Hawaii, which keeps a benchmark record of carbon dioxide levels. The Energy Department published a report by contrarian scientists that downplayed the severity of climate change, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that past US government reports on climate science — which have been taken down from government websites — will undergo review and possible alteration. News surfaced plans by NASA to abandon two satellites that measure CO2.

These and dozens of other actions taken since Jan. 20 paint a clear picture: The Trump administration is going to war with established climate science. Mass firings, regulatory rollbacks, program closures, and funding cuts across agencies have compromised the nation’s ability to gather and assess data on climate change, reducing the amount of high-quality information that policymakers and business leaders can use to guide their decisions, potentially for years to come.

It’s the most aggressive targeting of climate science by any US administration, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former federal workers and officials, academic researchers and members of Congress. It parallels Trump officials’ efforts to sideline or question other types of widely accepted expertise, from vaccine research to labor statistics.

“They’re doing away with science. That, to me, is enormously troubling,” said Christine Todd Whitman, EPA administrator under President George W. Bush and the former Republican governor of New Jersey. “It’s science across the administration.”

The assault has left hundreds of federal scientists out of work, but its impacts reach much further. Datasets that industries and policymakers depend on have gone dark. Weather forecasting nationwide has been strained. The cancellation of billions of dollars in grants has halted work on, to cite only two examples, mapping of flood and storm risks for the US Coast Guard and improved stormwater infrastructure for towns in North Carolina.

Meanwhile, the administration wants to relax limits on climate pollution for fossil fuel and manufacturing as it reins in electric vehicles, solar power and especially wind farms. Marginalizing the science on global warming helps this push by seeming to weaken the case for clean energy and affirming the decision by governments and companies to keep pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers when asked about the government-wide shift. “The Trump administration is committed to eliminating bias and producing Gold Standard Science research driven by verifiable data that informs Americans’ decision-making while keeping them safe.”

Not every cut and rollback will survive the many lawsuits that have been filed to stop them. Some moves have already been reversed.

Michael Gerrard, faculty director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, described the administration’s strategy as “a cluster-bomb approach.”

“They’re fighting on multiple fronts, some legal, some not,” he said. “They just want to see what ultimately hits.”

The barrage is hard to track. Even changes with major long-term consequences can “slip under the radar, because there's so much else going on. And that’s part of the tactic,” said Whitman.

Over the first six months of Trump’s second term, the administration took roughly 400 anti-science actions, many more than in the entirety of his first term, according to tracking by the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. Meanwhile, the impacts of climate change are piling up, from intense heat waves to massive wildfires to deadly floods. Last year was the hottest ever recorded.

Whether we will have enough reliable data to predict, recover from and adapt to these impacts is an open question, experts say. “Some damage will take decades to regain. Some cannot be repaired,” said Julio Friedmann, chief scientist of advisory firm Carbon Direct and a former Energy Department official who served in two administrations.

“The result,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, “is going to be that we are very, very unprepared for when the climate chickens come home to roost.”

The earliest impact felt by climate researchers came just one week after Trump’s return to the White House, when the Office of Management and Budget froze all outgoing federal funds. Judges intervened to halt the order, but many grants remained frozen, putting climate research, projects and jobs in limbo. The EPA moved to wrest back from bank accounts $20 billion of climate funding awarded by the Biden administration; a recent ruling by a federal appeals court cleared the way for the agency to go ahead, pending further litigation.

The EPA under Trump is “laser-focused on its core mission of protecting human health and the environment,” said agency spokesperson Carolyn Holran. She said Administrator Lee Zeldin cancelled the grants due to his concerns over conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients and missing agency oversight.

Then came the downsizings. Through a combination of probationary employee firings, early retirement offers, reductions in force and resignations, agencies shed thousands of employees. In the first five months of the year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency lost 2,446 workers, including dozens of senior officials, according to a Sept. 2 report by the US Government Accountability Office. The EPA said about 400 people left between this year through mid-August. But 2,300 employees are participating in early retirement and deferred resignation programs, and most are technically still on the roster for now. Not included in these figures are the dozens of employees that have recently been placed on administrative leave at both agencies for signing onto open letters criticizing their Trump-appointed leaders.

So many departed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Weather Service that it is now trying to hire many of them back. But the nation’s weather forecasting capabilities have already been affected. At least seven of 122 NWS offices no longer operate around the clock due to shortages. Now, if an office can’t cover all of its shifts, its closest neighbor will help put out disaster watches and warnings for the territory, said Tom Fahy, legislative director for the union National Weather Service Employees Organization.

Staffing cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also had a ripple effect on local climate work around the US. Officials in Maricopa County, Arizona, relied on the agency’s data and guidance to help them track heat-related illnesses and deaths. Doing without it “means Arizona is losing critical support,” said Maren Mahoney, director of the state’s Office of Resiliency.

In April, the administration also dismissed hundreds of outside scientists who had volunteered their time to write the sixth National Climate Assessment, a landmark report mandated by Congress. The last edition of the NCA took nearly four years to develop and had some 750 contributors. It’s widely consulted by businesses and policymakers as a roadmap to current and future risks: Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., Marriott International Inc. and The Travelers Companies Inc. have all cited NCAs in public disclosures.

Not only is the sixth report on ice, but the website hosting past reports was pulled down, making it harder for the public to access taxpayer-funded research.

“You tear down data, it impacts the scientists who use that data,” said Emily Grover-Kopec, a director in the climate and energy practice of the research firm Rhodium Group and a meteorologist by training. “But ultimately this affects businesses, policymakers, city planners, individuals — they’re just looking to make good decisions with some information.”

Then, in July, the Energy Department published climate research of its own. It released a report by five scientists, handpicked by Wright, who oppose the consensus view on climate change. The report argues that global warming projections are exaggerated, benefits from higher levels of carbon dioxide are overlooked and policies to reduce emissions may do more harm than good.

Numerous experts have criticized these conclusions, and a group of more than 80 researchers issued a detailed critique of the report on Sept. 2. Another group of former military leaders and national security experts said it failed to address the defense implications of a warming planet.

Wright told Bloomberg Television that the agency isn’t denying the reality of climate change, which he called “a real physical phenomenon,” but that it has “put climate in its rightful place.” The report, he said, gives Americans “a more realistic view of this phenomenon. It’s just not even close to the world’s greatest problem. But that’s the only reason we’ve justified putting expensive wind turbines out.”

Wright’s suggestion that US energy policy has been too tethered to climate concerns is emblematic of the administration’s stance. It “very clearly sees climate as a social, economic and scientific phenomenon taking us down the wrong direction with respect to the kinds of energy we use,” said Joseph Majkut, director of the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The Energy Department released the contrarian report in tandem with EPA proposing to roll back the endangerment finding, and to unwind related regulations on emissions from vehicles, power plants and oil wells. The attempted repeal will be hard-fought in court. Should it go through, it would have long-lasting consequences by making it harder for federal agencies to create new climate regulations without explicit congressional approval.

“We have basically an EPA that’s totally been defanged of its mission,” said Gina McCarthy, the EPA chief under President Barack Obama and a climate advisor to President Joe Biden. “It’s simply beneficial to the fossil fuel industry.”

The agency said deregulation ensures it sticks to its mission. Since the endangerment finding, spokesperson Holran said, consumers and automakers “have suffered from significant uncertainties and massive costs” due to vehicle emissions standards. If the finding is rescinded, “companies can plan appropriately, and the American people can have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car.”

Trump has made it a top priority to extract more fossil energy — declaring an energy emergency, exempting some coal power plants from pollution rules and speeding up permitting for oil and gas projects. That’s a stark contrast to the hurdles put in front of the renewables sector. Republicans in Congress hastened the end of tax credits for solar and wind production and electric cars in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. But getting rid of Biden-era incentives wasn’t the end of it.

The Energy Department killed financing for a transmission line planned to carry wind power across the Midwest. The EPA pulled the plug on Solar for All, $7 billion to help low-income households tap solar power.

The Interior Department has created a snarl of red tape for all renewables projects on federal lands. It has taken particular aim at offshore wind, which Trump loathes. It withdrew millions of acres of ocean from potential use for wind power, and in August halted construction at a wind farm that was nearly finished. The agency also revoked approval for a planned 231-turbine wind project in Idaho and is trying to block other projects in Massachusetts and Maryland. The Interior Department didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The hobbling of the sector coincides with rising electricity demand from AI and data centers. Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, a Democrat, told Bloomberg News the administration should be “working with states, not against states, in an effort to bring more power on board.”

The overall outlook for US clean energy has dimmed. New capacity added through 2030 will be 23% lower than forecast before the tax bill passed, according to BloombergNEF.

Researchers at Princeton University projected in July that the tax bill and other Trump policies will lead to 470 million more tons of carbon emissions in 2035. That’s equivalent to the energy used by 63 million American homes per year.

Justin Mankin, a scientist at Dartmouth College, estimates there will be $35 billion in economic losses in the US by 2035 from the clean energy rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act alone. Meanwhile, China installed over half of the world’s new solar last year and makes more than 70% of the EVs sold globally.

“We're ceding economic leadership in the energy transition to China,” Mankin said.

The administration’s policies will also limit the nation’s capacity to defend itself from the climate impacts that are already piling up: more intense storms, fires, heat waves and floods.

Trump and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have called for eliminating FEMA, which DHS oversees, and putting the burden of disaster response on states, localities and individuals. Trump launched a review council “tasked with reforming and streamlining the agency,” a group that’s set to release recommendations later this fall.

But already, the administration has taken several steps to dial back the federal government’s role in responding to and preparing for disasters. FEMA has stopped sending staff doorknocking to help survivors in disaster-hit areas, and it has reduced the amount of aid it gives to states that experience a catastrophe.

In April, FEMA terminated its billion-dollar Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program, with funds that states could use to protect themselves by, for instance, elevating structures in floodplains or retrofitting hospitals against fierce storms. (Twenty states challenged the ending of the program in July, and a judge then ruled the administration cannot spend the funds elsewhere while litigation continues.)

Trump’s FEMA “is leaner, faster, and laser-focused on real disaster response,” according to a written statement provided by the agency’s press office, which called the door canvassing effort “wasteful and ineffective.” The spokesperson said the Biden administration was “burning through FEMA’s budget on so called ‘climate change’ and DEI pet projects.”

If FEMA disappears or shrinks significantly, states will have to mount their own responses at their expense, and households may be stuck with higher taxes and insurance premiums. This would sap GDP growth in disaster-prone states, according to research by Bloomberg Intelligence.

The US is the biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, and the rest of the world is feeling the effects of its U-turn. Trump has struck trade deals that commit other countries to buying more US oil and gas, potentially slowing their own carbon-cutting progress. The administration has been pushing for changes at the International Energy Agency, displeased by forecasts it views as too green.

The US retreat from the Paris Agreement and climate diplomacy is already providing cover for governments, banks and corporations that have watered down or dropped green pledges. The dynamic is also tempering ambitions for the United Nations’ upcoming COP30 climate summit in Brazil, since it could give more leverage to Saudi Arabia and other countries that have worked to block strong targets at past talks.

(Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News’ parent company Bloomberg LP, is the UN Secretary-General’s special envoy on climate ambition and solutions. His philanthropic organization Bloomberg Philanthropies has said it will help cover US financial obligations under the Paris Agreement following Trump’s withdrawal.)

American scientists have long played a major role in writing the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, considered the gold standard of climate science. Four dozen plan to contribute to the next edition. But after the closure of the federal program that once supported this work, scientific organizations are fundraising to cover expenses, and some researchers will have to find their own funding to take part. The IPCC also draws on regional research like the National Climate Assessment; its suspension means there will be less granular data about the US available in the future.

Fortunately, the global climate science effort is less dependent on the US than in prior decades, according to Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director of international climate for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Other countries and private companies have launched satellites that can collect climate and weather data that only the US did a decade or two ago.

But the US has the best-resourced scientific establishment in the world, and many holes will inevitably go unplugged. The result will be less insight into the current state of climate and weather, as well as what lies around the corner. It will be harder to tell promising solutions from dead ends. Public trust in US government data will decline, making it easier for misinformation to take hold. The country will be groping with one hand tied behind its back as record-breaking heat and storms become the new normal.

“We’re going to be playing catch-up all the time. We’re not going to be prepared for the challenges of the future,” said Whitman. “That’s the real tragedy here.

Critics of the so-called ‘devastation bill’ celebrate as the government U-turns on controversial provisions slated to have ‘grave’ consequences for human rights, environmental and climate protections.

In a major win for environmental safeguarding, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has scrapped 63 articles from a recently adopted environmental licensing law that were the subject of intense international scrutiny over their potential to roll back environmental, climate and human rights safeguards.

UN experts on Thursday (4 September) lauded the move as a “decisive step” in the protection of the environment and human rights, and the prevention of a weakened environmental licensing process, adding that the vetoes reflected well on the country’s “commitment to upholding international human rights and environmental obligations”.

THE DEVASTATION BILL

The experts, appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, were quick to express their “grave concerns” over Bill PL 2159/2021 – widely known as the ‘devastation Bill’ – following its approval by the Brazilian Federal Senate on 21 May 2025. In a 26 May letter addressed to the Brazilian government, they lamented the addition of “serious and aggressive amendments” to the Bill that either altered or abandoned key provisions that would have ensured environmental and human rights were upheld.

The now-vetoed provisions included, among other amendments, the exemption of mining activities from licensing obligations; weakened protections for the Atlantic Forest; and simplified licensing processes through automatic permit renewals and developer self-declarations.

“These modifications can have serious and irreversible damages to the environment, aggravating the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and toxic pollution,” the experts wrote.

Critics also condemned the Bill’s impact on indigenous peoples and Quilombola Afro-descendant communities living on unmarked lands whose rights to informed consent processes would be threatened by the amendments.

INTERNATIONAL OUTRAGE

Though supported by the oil and gas and agribusiness sectors, the Bill’s new provisions sparked international outrage. In early July, 352 organisations and civil society groups condemned the Bill as “a major institutional setback for Brazil and the undoing of over 40 years of national environmental legislation”. (Google translation)

Despite the intense backlash, the Bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 17 July 2025, with 267 votes in favour and 115 against.

In a statement issued on 25 July 2025, UN experts urged the president to veto the provisions that “contradict Brazil’s constitutional and international obligations”. They pointed to the Bill’s potential to damage Brazil’s credibility as host of the upcoming 2025 Climate Change Conference, COP30, reminding the country of its obligations to ensure its legislation aligns with international commitments such as those signed under the Paris Agreement.

“While procedural efficiency in environmental licensing is important, it must not be achieved at the expense of effective regulations, controls and monitoring, and accountability, and human rights and environmental protections,” they wrote.

The experts added that the licensing amendments were likely to disproportionately impact indigenous peoples and Quilombola Afro-descendant communities. With these individuals already bearing the brunt of environmental and climate harms, they warned that the proposed measures would violate Brazil’s non-discrimination obligations.

Following Congress’ stamp of approval, human rights organisation Amnesty International echoed the sentiments of the UN experts and urged President Lula to veto the Bill while criticising its lack of “public debate and transparency”.

“This Bill drastically weakens environmental licensing, undermines critical environmental institutions, and shows little regard for human rights,” the organisation said. “We call on the president to veto this bill, as it threatens the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the rights to access to information, public participation and access to justice, as well as the rights of indigenous peoples and climate justice.”

NEXT STEPS

Welcoming the Brazilian government’s move to scrap the 63 provisions from the Bill, the UN experts called on the National Congress to uphold the presidential vetoes, issuing a stark warning that failure to do so would violate the country’s constitution as well as its international obligations under customary international law and several treaties.

With a simplified licensing process for ‘strategic projects’ retained in the law, the experts cautioned that all projects, both standard and strategic, poised to significantly impact the environment, climate or human rights must undergo “an adequate and comprehensive environmental impact assessment based on the best available science, including Indigenous science and other knowledge systems”.",https://iclg.com/uploads/pages/images/brazil-blocks-problematic-provisions-from-environmental-licensing-bill_0_7Vq5Sg75twW5BTmhaL8gd62hEgQnTEh5MNbEgjz5.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 18:03:38.130209

Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

Portland General Electric and its partner Mitsubishi Power have quietly shelved a planned hydrogen production, storage and hydrogen-fueled generation complex near Boardman, Oregon.

“Given the exit of an essential project partner in June, along with challenging project economics for utility customers and federal policy changes, PGE is no longer pursuing” the hydrogen complex, PGE spokesman Drew Hanson said via email.

The cancellation comes at a dicey time for the tri-state Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, the ringleader that is channeling federal money to projects in the region. The U.S. Energy Department is scrutinizing clean energy programs and initiatives launched under the Biden administration, including the Northwest hub. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he is ready to terminate funding for projects that he deems “a bridge to nowhere.”

Elected officials from across the political spectrum in the Northwest have defended low-emissions hydrogen as a promising means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power.

“We have several new projects in the pipeline that we’re excited to share more on soon,” spokesperson Kaitlin Sheppard said in an emailed statement on behalf of the Northwest hydrogen hub. “PNWH2 continues to evaluate additional project interest and remains focused on supporting a broad, resilient regional hydrogen ecosystem with the potential to deliver lasting economic value to Oregon and the greater Pacific Northwest.”

The PGE and Mitsubishi Power pullback follows in the wake of the scrapping of a different hydrogen factory in Centralia, Washington, proposed by Fortescue, which was to be one of the primary producers of the alternative fuel within the regional clean energy hub. Another founding partner in the PNWH2 Hub, Seattle-based developer of hydrogen-powered mining trucks First Mode, declared bankruptcy last December.

PGE’s pivot calls into question what will happen at the nearby Port of Morrow, where Air Liquide planned to build a hydrogen liquefaction plant to support distribution of clean hydrogen to urban fueling stations and the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. PGE and Mitsubishi were supposed to supply the gaseous hydrogen to Air Liquide via a short pipeline from the site of PGE’s demolished coal power plant outside Boardman.

Air Liquide acknowledged a request for comment, but a spokesperson declined to shed more light about where things are headed now.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub said in its emailed statement that “project adjustments were expected and planned for” in the early development phase of the nascent industry. The pullback in this region tracks with what is happening elsewhere.

Brand name corporations — such as Shell, BP and Airbus — and lesser-known startups around the world are scaling back their hydrogen ambitions. Commonly cited reasons include a slower-than-anticipated emergence of customer demand and stubbornly high costs to produce green hydrogen.

The developers behind the two remaining large-scale projects in the Northwest hydrogen hub are pressing ahead. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro plans to build a $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, for which hydrogen produced on site will be a key ingredient. Meanwhile, Calgary-based AltaGas has a costly plan to redevelop the closed Alcoa aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.

Crucially, Atlas Agro and AltaGas need to secure large volumes of affordable renewable electricity for the energy-intensive process of making hydrogen. The green fertilizer plant reportedly needs around 300 megawatts of power, which is a bigger load than all of the rest of Richland combined.

AltaGas estimated last year that it needs about 265 megawatts of electricity to achieve its maximum production target at Ferndale. Neither company has confirmed they have a power supply contract amid rising competition for sources of renewable electricity.

“The success of this project is contingent on regulatory and financial incentive certainty, timely approvals, and a clear and predictable path forward from government and commercial partners,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub game plan envisions that producers will make “green” hydrogen exclusively by splitting water molecules with an electric current. This process (known as electrolysis) must use renewable electricity for the resulting hydrogen to be considered green.

Hydrogen sector dependent on uncertain government support

A year ago, the Pacific NW hub collected the first installment from its potentially $1 billion federal allocation. That $27.5 million in initial funding through the Energy Department partially passed through to participating companies and to Washington State University to begin site planning and community outreach.

Under the original program terms, another tranche of funding would come 12-18 months after the first to subsidize developer permitting and engineering. A third tranche could underwrite the construction phase for multiple years, before a possible final shot of money comes to subsidize production ramp up. In all, the hub could pass through federal subsidies to its participants for 8-12 years.

But this past May, Wright, President Donald Trump’s energy secretary, announced a department-wide review of grant programs to root out “wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars.” Wright expressed skepticism about government support to scale up clean hydrogen.

“Hydrogen, it’s tough with the math to see how in the long term it becomes a meaningful commercial energy source,” Wright told senators at a budget hearing in front of the Senate Energy Committee in June, during which Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, pressed him to state his position on the hydrogen hubs.

“It’s expensive to produce, but there are high value uses,” Wright went on to say about hydrogen. He predicted the agency will continue funding some projects under review, modify others and terminate the “low-value” ones.

Cantwell responded that the Northwest’s renewable hydropower made her region a good place to make hydrogen for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

A spokesperson at Energy Department headquarters confirmed this past week that the program vetting was ongoing, but declined to estimate when the results will become known.

Democrats in the U.S. Senate preemptively wrote a joint letter to Wright in April asserting it would be illegal for the Trump administration to unilaterally cancel Congressionally-approved spending on clean energy projects. Oregon’s Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Washington’s Patty Murray and Cantwell signed on.

“Our Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and exclusive power to appropriate funds,” the 27 senators wrote. “In this instance, where Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for programs that support clean energy projects, the Department must faithfully execute the law and expend the funds for the purposes provided.”

If the PNWH2 Hub survives the Energy Department vetting, the pressure will still be on. Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled Congress shortened the window for companies to get lucrative tax incentives that were created in the 2022 Biden climate and clean energy package.

Private developers now have until the end of 2027 to begin construction on a hydrogen plant in order to qualify for production tax credits. The deadline was previously 2033. Clean hydrogen producers strive to qualify for the tax credit in order to lower the otherwise high retail price of the fuel.

“Under current federal and state permitting regimes, this accelerated timeline may jeopardize our eligibility for the tax credit, which is essential for achieving positive project returns, and we are evaluating our ability to meet the new timelines,” said Doyle from AltaGas.",https://corvallisadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Clean-Hydrogen-construction-1024x576.png,N,,2025-09-08 18:03:33.413813

“This method of crossing water bodies degrades water quality, pollutes drinking water sources, and harms habitat for aquatic species,” said the organization.

“Water is a sacred source of all life and should be treated as a beloved relative,” said Seth Harris, programs director at 7 Directions of Service, an Indigenous-led advocacy organization. “It's past time we do everything in our power to protect our water, and invest in North Carolina’s resilience, not waste money on dead-end polluting infrastructure like Transo’s SSEP.”

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) held a hearing Thursday evening in Kernersville in Forsyth County to hear comments from members of the public. State officials are accepting public comment online until Oct. 6. (Project No. 20240801; Version 2)

According to the N.C. DEQ, the project is proposed to include approximately 4.4 miles of 42-inch diameter pipeline in Rockingham County, known as the Eden loop. The project would also include construction of approximately 24.1 miles of 42-inch diameter pipeline in Guilford, Forsyth, and Davidson counties, known as the Salem loop. Finally, the proposed project would modify existing compressor stations and other facilities in Davidson, Cleveland, Iredell, Lincoln, and Gaston counties.

This project is part of a larger push to expand natural gas infrastructure across the U.S. Two other pipelines could also be built in North Carolina: MVP Southgate and Enbridge T-15.

Why is this project needed?

In its permit application to state officials, Transco says this project is needed “to meet growing natural gas fired power generation, commercial, residential, and industrial demand in the southeast United States.” Transco says SSEP “helps support companies switching from coal to gas.”

Critics of the project say new pipeline infrastructure isn’t needed to begin with. Groups like the Southern Environmental Law Center contend resources should instead be put toward renewable energy.

“The Transco expansion project … represents a multi-generational investment in fossil fuels at a moment of deepening urgency in the climate crisis,” the law center said in a press release from October 2024. “If this Transco expansion project is approved, it will result in tens of millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year, putting federal and state emissions reduction goals firmly out of reach.”

Natural gas contains several different components, the largest being methane, a potent greenhouse gas. According to NASA, methane is the second largest contributor to climate warming after carbon dioxide. The EPA estimates about 6.5 million metric tons of methane leak from the oil and gas supply chain each year. However, that number is very likely underreported, according to researchers at MIT and Johns Hopkins University.

In its application, Transco states renewable energies, like solar and wind, can’t meet the nation’s energy demand.

“Wind and solar energy sources cannot provide the reliable dispatch of load following energy generation that natural gas can provide, nor can they be made available at the scale necessary to meet customer' s required demand,” the application said.

Water quality concerns

The new pipeline is proposed to cross several dozen streams and wetlands across North Carolina, using mostly dry-open cut methods and trenchless technologies. In its application, Transco said it will follow best management practices to minimize and avoid impacts on waterways during construction.

However the group NO SSEP, which advocates against the pipeline, disagrees with these practices.

“This method of crossing water bodies degrades water quality, pollutes drinking water sources, and harms habitat for aquatic species,” said the organization.

Another group, Clean Water for North Carolina, recently released interactive maps showing the proposed route overlaid with the bodies of water it would cross.

“The Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (would damage) … drinking water sources, and that includes surface water as well as groundwater,” said Stephanie Gans, assistant director at Clean Water for North Carolina. “There are public water supplies … that are very close to the proposed path.”

Local governments pass resolutions urging regulators to take action

In late August, Forsyth County Commissioners passed a resolution urging state and federal regulators ""to meaningfully address safety and environmental concerns regarding the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project and to deny approval of the project.""

""This pipeline enhancement project raises a range of concerns for citizens, including, but not limited to, public safety risks, water resource impacts, environmental degradation, increased electric rates, and economic risks,"" stated the resolution.

The commissioners also pointed to Transco's poor safety record, according to data analysis by watchdog group Pipeline Safety Trust.

In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How we got here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world – especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars – especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don’t have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric vehicles are cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today’s electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are “not meaningful” contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An opportunity for cleaner electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions – it also misses an opportunity to make the nation’s electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation’s power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built – and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don’t need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren’t charging.

A virtuous – or vicious – cycle

Our analysis reveals that what’s good for climate in the transportation sector – eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes – is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can’t last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can’t single-handedly stop this transition – it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/689715/original/file-20250908-64-rbsloy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C54%2C6240%2C3120&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-08 17:03:42.652935

(WHAM) — John Iannone from the Electric Car Corner in Farmington said selling electric vehicles was a slow roll at first, but sales have steadily been speeding up in recent years.

Iannone said when you buy an EV, maintenance is on your side and, obviously, gas isn’t an issue.

He does acknowledge some people have ""mileage anxiety"" when taking bigger trips and looking for those charging stations.

""Most EVs now get well over 300 miles per charge, so it's just those occasional trips that may be in question,"" he said. ""And even then, it's only a 20-minute wait to get another 300 miles.”

Florida Marks Fifth Straight Year of Clean Air

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) announced that Florida has met all federal air quality standards for the fifth consecutive year. Florida is the most populous state in the nation to achieve this distinction, underscoring the success of strong air quality monitoring, effective pollution controls and collaboration with partners at every level.

The Clean Air Act requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six criteria air pollutants that can harm human health and the environment: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particle pollution and sulfur dioxide. Florida’s industrial emissions have declined 78 percent since 2000, and ozone levels – the most widespread air pollutant – have fallen by nearly half over the past twenty years. This success reflects years of collaboration between DEP and stakeholders to reduce emissions and improve air quality.

Florida maintains one of the nation’s most comprehensive air quality monitoring networks, with 180 monitors at 90 sites across the state. The network meets or exceeds federal requirements and ensures accurate, real-time data for residents and communities.

September 15, 2025

Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a public comment period on its intent to issue a permit for Marquis Carbon Injection LLC to inject and store carbon dioxide underground at an injection well in Putnam County, Illinois.

The process of storing carbon underground is known as “carbon sequestration.” Under the proposed plan, Marquis Carbon Injection would inject up to 1.5 million metric tons of carbon per year, over a period of six years. Marquis would be required to monitor the wells—during the six years of proposed injection and for twelve years afterwards—to ensure that the injection wells work properly, the carbon dioxide does not move from its injected location and drinking water sources are protected.

The formation where carbon will be stored is approximately 3,094 feet below ground. Studies of the site show that there is about 963 feet of rock, including a 404-foot-thick confining zone composed of impermeable shale and carbonates, between the deepest underground source of drinking water and the proposed injection location. EPA has concluded that the well materials, intended operation of the well, and underlying geology are appropriate for carbon sequestration and will prevent endangerment of underground drinking water sources.

EPA will host a public availability session on October 15 to engage in conversation and answer questions on the draft permit and a public hearing on October 29 to hear and record public comments. Comments may also be submitted in writing.

The AirKeeper Dashboard is a mapping tool that presents results from the nonprofit's air monitors. The reports also include information on pollution sources, demographic data and public health.

“Obviously, we want to make it free for community members so it's easily accessible,” Williams said. “But for institutions and corporations that are also interested in using the dashboard, we're trying to create a system where they can have either a subscription or pay for their colleagues to use it.”

Lead Firm: Canada-based Nucleon Energy

Scope: Site selection, licensing, public engagement, workforce assessment & cost modeling

Timeline: 2025 – 2027. Potential construction before 2030

Proposed Technology: Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)

Impact: Energy diversification, grid stability, carbon-free initiative

North Dakota’s Energy Mix

North Dakota is already among the leading states in U.S. oil production, is among the top ten wind energy producers by capacity in the states, is a major lignite coal basin, and has strong transmission corridors feeding Midwest markets.

Ideally, adding nuclear would enhance grid stability and help diversify beyond fossil dependence. This comes at a time when the strain on U.S. grids is clearly evident as flagged by the WSP Pulse Report 2025, which showed overwhelming public support for affordability, grid safety and modernization, and assessments on climate impact of using fossil fuels for energy generation.

Now serving as the fifty-fifth United States Secretary of the Interior, former North Dakota Governor, Doug Burgum, has also consistently stressed on “energy dominance” and an expansion of America’s fossil fuel production. Burgum makes clear of this through pushing for fossil-fuels and his support for coal plants. Crowning this has been marked by events like the halting of the now resumed $5 billion Empire offshore wind project by Equinor off the coast of New York City. Despite all this, he also promised to make North Dakota carbon neutral by 2030.

North Dakota has already forged great steps in lignite coal, oil, and wind capacity. Nuclear, particularly SMRs, is now being considered to ensure grid reliability and long-term energy independence.

Nuclear in the U.S. Energy Market

North Dakota picking Nucleon Energy to lay groundwork for its nuclear power plan positions the state to join others like Michigan, Washington, Idaho, and Tennessee, where the nuclear market is already growing.

This decision also aligns and fits with federal ambitions under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The act allocates tax credits and loan guarantees for zero-carbon technologies, including nuclear.

Some investors, utilities, and even the Trump administration alike see SMRs and nuclear as a hedge against intermittency risks from wind and solar, while complementing gas and LNG projects such as the Alaska LNG mega-project now under review by Japanese buyers. Japan also plans to build a next-generation nuclear reactor at the 1,666 MW Mihama nuclear power plant in Fukui Prefecture, marking the country’s first concrete post-Fukushima move towards the construction of a new nuclear reactor.

Trump administration officials have acknowledged growing consumer concern about energy costs but say intermittent wind and solar energy are to blame for the increases.
“The president has a long-standing distaste for wind power and solar power, but the practical impact is that bills do go up,” Rep. Mike Levin, D-Calif., said in a brief interview.
“And so I think long term, how you address energy costs is you invest in American clean energy security.
“The real energy emergency isn’t a made-up crisis — it’s the skyrocketing energy costs American families are facing because of Republicans’ relentless attacks on clean energy,” Heinrich said in a statement.","As electricity prices outpace inflation, members of Congress and the administration have constituents’ bills on their mind, with Democrats hoping they will help them make the case against Trump administration policies.

The bill would provide $57.3 billion for federal energy and water programs, including the nuclear defense programs and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. However, much of the concern during floor debate was on how the measure would affect consumer energy bills.

Republicans said the provisions of the bill that increase investments in nuclear energy, fossil fuels and critical minerals would support the Trump administration’s goals for constantly running baseload power, while Democrats said spending cuts, such as a 47 percent reduction to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, would cede U.S. leadership on renewable energy sources as China continues to invest in the sector.

Increases in energy costs are “not sustainable for working families, and sadly, this Republican Energy and Water bill does not meet our nation’s energy and water imperative for the future, nor for the present,” said Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee ranking member Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, adding that she had heard from a constituent whose energy bill doubled in July.

Energy demand is increasing across the country, at an average rate of 1.7 percent per year, according to the Energy Information Administration. This is largely driven by the commercial and industrial sector, which includes data centers for artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

With this, electricity prices have risen at double the rate of inflation in the past year.

Trump administration officials have acknowledged growing consumer concern about energy costs but say intermittent wind and solar energy are to blame for the increases.

“We had 100 years of flat to declining inflation-adjusted electricity prices until President Obama decided we’re going to save the planet with renewable power,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in an interview with Laura Ingraham on Sept. 4. Wind and solar energy “are the reason we have more expensive electricity,” he said.

The Trump administration has used this argument to support actions such as issuing a stop-work order for the nearly completed Revolution Wind facility off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island. The states and the developer, Danish wind giant Ørsted S.A., have sued the administration over this decision.

When announcing their intent to sue on Sept. 4, the states’ Democratic attorneys general cited an August statement from regional grid operator ISO New England that said project delays will jeopardize reliability in the summer and winter peak periods and “will adversely affect New England’s economy and industrial growth, including potential future data centers.”

As they aim to retake power in the 2026 midterm elections, Democrats have sought to tie the increase in electricity prices to President Donald Trump’s policies on wind and solar, which they say have been borne out of a desire to support fossil fuels.

“The president has a long-standing distaste for wind power and solar power, but the practical impact is that bills do go up,” Rep. Mike Levin, D-Calif., said in a brief interview. “And so I think long term, how you address energy costs is you invest in American clean energy security. You modernize the grid, and you do everything we can to harness the lowest-cost source.”

Last week, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., renewed their push for a joint resolution that would terminate the energy emergency that Trump declared on his first day in office. Trump’s executive order has been used to support actions to keep fossil fuel plants open and take actions that supporters of wind and solar energy say make them less competitive.

The 1976 law that gives the president the power to declare a national emergency also established procedures for a privileged resolution to end the emergency declaration, which can be reintroduced every six months if the emergency declaration is maintained. Any member can bring the resolution up for a vote in the coming weeks.

In February, the Senate rejected, 47-52, an earlier joint resolution along party lines, but Kaine and Heinrich are tying a potential vote on the newer joint resolution to rising energy costs and the cancellation of renewable energy projects to pressure Republicans who previously supported the emergency declaration.

“The real energy emergency isn’t a made-up crisis — it’s the skyrocketing energy costs American families are facing because of Republicans’ relentless attacks on clean energy,” Heinrich said in a statement.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/09/OHPOL_534_102624-1.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 17:05:03.288045

Significance

Transportation is the largest source of GHG emissions in the United States, and light duty vehicles make up the majority of transportation emissions. Electrification is the primary strategy for decarbonizing transportation, and the effect of electric vehicle (EV) charging on the power grid is the largest factor in determining the net emissions implications of electrification. We find that EV adoption can induce wind, solar, and natural gas infrastructure investments that shift power generation mix and emissions, producing lower consequential emissions estimates of EV adoption than prior studies that ignore long run effects. Our power system emissions estimates for policy-relevant EV adoption trajectories can help quantify emissions implications of policy decisions and inform public and scientific discussions around EVs.

Abstract

We model the effect of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) adoption on U.S. power system generator capacity investment, operations, and emissions through 2050 by estimating power systems outcomes under a range of EV adoption trajectory scenarios. Our EV adoption scenarios are informed by 1) an Energy Information Administration scenario with no policy intervention, 2) EV growth expected under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), 3) a Biden Administration 50% EV sales target by 2030, 4) the Environmental Protection Agency’s projections under vehicle emissions standards, and 5) the International Energy Agency’s roadmap to Net Zero by 2050. We find across these scenarios that increasing EV adoption induces investment in new wind, solar, storage, and natural gas capacity, affecting power generation mix and emissions. The net effect of increasing EV adoption beyond our IRA base case is to increase power sector emissions by about 5 mtCO2eq per EV-year in 2026 (comparable to displaced gasoline vehicle combustion emissions), but this effect rapidly drops to annual levels below 1 mtCO2eq per EV-year by 2032 and continues below this level through 2050. Consequential effects of EV adoption vary regionally, with most regions primarily increasing wind or solar capacity and some regions primarily increasing natural gas capacity, even in 2050. Our national emissions estimates per EV-year are relatively robust to the level of EV adoption beyond our baseline and to variation in assumptions about power systems, EV behavior, and policy.

Time is running out for anyone thinking about buying or leasing an electric vehicle who also wants a discount. The federal EV tax credit—worth up to $7,500—is ending on Sept. 30.

“For more than a decade, this program has helped make EVs more affordable, but once it’s gone, so are those savings, says Aaron Bragman, Detroit Bureau Chief, Cars.com. “While most shoppers have heard of the credit, a recent study from Cars.com shows only about a third really understand how it works. That’s important, because nearly 80% of car shoppers considering EVs say it factors into their decision to go electric, and almost half say they might speed up their plans before the deadline hits.”

For shoppers considering an EV, start shopping now so you can finalize your purchase and take delivery before the Sept. 30 deadline. Some automakers and dealers are also offering their own discounts and financing deals, which can stack on top of the credit to bring prices down even more.

“Looking ahead, the end of the credit doesn’t mean the end of affordable EVs,” he says. “Brands like Nissan, Chevrolet, and Hyundai are rolling out lower-priced options, and used EVs are getting more attractive too, with plenty available under $25,000. Battery costs are also coming down, which will help keep prices competitive in the long run.”

I recently test drove the Chevrolet Equinox, which is a really good value for a starting price of $34,995 for the LT trim. Another EV that qualifies for the tax credit is the Hyundai Ioniq 5 which starts at $44,200.

Eligibility for the tax credit is not only dependent on the vehicle but also on your own income and filing status. Many states and cities offer their own incentives that will still be around even after the federal program ends, Bragman says.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/08/18/equinox-ev_BSSo9Zf.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 17:06:02.456168

More From Our Experts

The Trump administration is pulling back sharply on large-scale projects that demonstrate cutting-edge energy technologies. Unless Congress steps in forcefully to preserve the program which a bipartisan majority funded just four years ago, the cuts will slow the global response to climate change and hurt U.S. competitiveness in emerging energy technologies. China, meanwhile, is stepping up its investments and seeking to extend its technological lead.

Why governments should invest in demonstration projects

United States

Many of the technologies that large-scale demonstration projects would advance, such as new kinds of nuclear reactors or steel mills, could ultimately pay off for society, but the risks and costs of their first iterations are usually too steep even for very risk-tolerant capitalists to take on. Government investment in demonstration projects plugs the gap left by private investors.

Scale and complexity are the roots of this problem. Large scale makes power plants and industrial facilities economical, enabling them to supply electricity and goods that are vital to society at low costs. The same features create barriers to innovation. The first full-scale nuclear reactor or steel plant of its type probably won’t run as smoothly or affordably as the older ones their builders hope to replace, even if the new ones have passed smaller-scale tests with flying colors. Moreover, potential competitors can sit back and learn from the first movers without risking a penny.

As a result, private investors frequently take a pass on staking hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars on demonstration projects. Yet the societal benefits of advancing these technologies can be large. A hefty fraction of the emissions that drive global climate change come from large-scale facilities. The innovations that could drastically reduce their emissions may have additional benefits, such as greater affordability or security. Government funding that bridges the so-called “demonstration valley of death” [PDF] can give domestic pioneers in these emerging sectors a leg up on their competitors abroad.

Gaps in the global portfolio

The United States, the European Union, and fifteen other nations responded to this challenge in September 2022 by pledging $94 billion in public funding to support large-scale demonstration projects during the current decade. This amount exceeded the $90 billion that the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated [PDF] would be needed to stay on its roadmap to net-zero emissions. However, as we show in a recent analysis, “the combined effort of pledged countries is falling far short of the pledge’s goal.”

Technological progress in the global demonstration project portfolio has been uneven as well. The IEA’s net-zero scenario highlighted eleven technology areas, ranging from synthetic fuels to small modular nuclear reactors. More than 80 percent of projects and funding tracked by the IEA have flowed to only four of these eleven: biofuels; carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS); offshore wind; and hydrogen production, storage, and transportation.

Some of the neglected areas are big contributors to climate change. For example, the steel industry, which causes 7 percent of global emissions, is the focus of only two projects. Similarly, international shipping, which causes another 3 percent, accounts for just two as well. Emissions from such sectors are not going to decline unless demonstration projects show that innovative clean technologies are technically viable and have a plausible pathway to affordability.

The United States’ Pullback

The United States committed $21.9 billion to the September 2022 pledge, comprising the entire budget of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) in the Department of Energy (DOE), which Congress had set up the year before. By the end of the Biden administration, Congress had given OCED more than $26.7 billion for large-scale projects. While some of these projects supported work in areas well-represented in the global portfolio, such as CCUS and hydrogen, others promised to fill gaps in areas like industrial decarbonization and long-duration energy storage.

The Trump administration is pulling back hard on these planned investments. In May 2025, DOE announced the cancellation of $3.7 billion awarded by OCED for industrial demonstration projects. The industries impacted included cement, fuels, chemicals, glass, and steel. The administration’s request for DOE’s fiscal year 2026 budget states that it would cancel an additional $15 billion [PDF], although the specific projects included in this proposal have not yet been identified.

The administration has also crippled DOE’s newly created capacity to manage large-scale projects. A reported 77 percent of OCED’s staff opted to leave the department voluntarily in the first few months of Trump’s term, and the office has essentially been dismantled.

OCED’s administrative record has been criticized in recent reports by DOE’s Inspector General as well as external observers. The task of overseeing billions of dollars for cutting-edge fields with very limited administrative funding, while developing project management capabilities that DOE had not previously possessed, was daunting. Some poorly designed projects were approved, and some decisions might have been rushed.

The critics have not shown that OCED made significant technical misjudgments, much less acted corruptly. Because the awards were phased, only about 3 percent of OCED’s budget has actually gone to developers, limiting the financial risk and allowing time to strengthen or drop weak projects. DOE did not provide substantial evidence, much less rigorous analysis, to back its cancellations. A review by Resources for the Future concluded that “that many of the projects that DOE canceled could have generated long-run public returns—and potential short-run financial returns...” The Energy Futures Initiative added that “canceling these awards has ripple effects. ...investors will lose faith in DOE-supported projects.”

China steps up

As the United States pulls back, China is stepping up. China already dominates key growth sectors, such as solar panels and battery manufacturing, and it is aggressively investing in emerging energy technologies. In March 2025, the central government announced 101 new demonstration projects, adding to the 47 funded last year. Iron and steel, long-duration energy storage, and the production of polysilicon (the primary material used in solar panels and semiconductors) are among the many technology areas targeted.

The United States remains engaged in some vital areas of emerging energy technologies, such as nuclear and geothermal power. The Trump administration has maintained the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, announced new initiatives to build plants at government sites, and eased licensing and permitting. China continues to invest in these areas as well. Competition between the two nations to refine and scale these technologies should accelerate innovation (although stronger international cooperation in precompetitive and non-proprietary R&D would also help).

U.S. relinquishes leadership as global gaps remain

But gaps in the global portfolio remain. Chemicals, fuels, shipping, and carbon dioxide removal are among the areas where American investment will be particularly missed. Even more important, the demise of OCED dramatically weakens the world’s capacity to identify and fill new gaps that will emerge as the economy and technology evolve in the coming decades. One of OCED’s final reports identified two dozen opportunities [PDF] that are promising now or likely to become so during this decade alone.

Over the past eighty years, federal innovation investment sparked the growth of major industries, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, the internet, and AI, to name a few. During the same time span, the United States frequently sought to mobilize international action to address collective problems. Congress carried forward these traditions when it created and funded OCED. Unless the administration can be persuaded to reverse course, the nation will relinquish both strands of global leadership this year.

In Quebec, its demise was less dramatic: a 171 barren hectares on Montreal’s South Shore.

This was to be home of the company’s first non-European battery factory, right up until the Quebec government pulled the plug on the project last week.

You might say the province got off easy. Yet by flopping in Sweden, Northvolt stands to have detrimental long-term effects on cleantech investment in Quebec and beyond.

First, the obvious. The Quebec government invested $270 million in the Northvolt project. That investment is now worthless. For context, that is more than enough money to revamp a good-sized hospital in Montreal, train 5,000 new construction workers or purchase just over a quarter of a new roof for the Olympic Stadium. Quebec also loaned Northvolt $240 million to purchase those 171 hectares, with the land itself as collateral, meaning the government must sell it for at least that amount, along with at least $20 million in interest, to make itself whole. Christine Fréchette, Quebec’s economic minister, recently said the government has managed to recoup $200 million, and said there is more coming.

Less obvious, but more profound, is Northvolt’s long shadow on the cleantech industry. Investments in world-saving technologies are in free fall, with the dollar value of Canadian investors’ deals in cleantech and climate-tech was down 45 per cent in 2024 compared to the year before. Granted, this is compared to the pandemic era, when green investment dollars flowed. Now, Trump’s tariffs, combined with its demonization of anything carbon reduction-related, has turned cleantech bulls into bears.

By virtue of its rapid rise and expensive downfall, Northvolt makes for an easy cautionary tale about the folly of cleantech investing. It’s already had an effect in Northvolt’s backyard. “In Sweden, private money is pulling back and becoming increasingly cautious, in large part because of what happened with Northvolt,” Christian Sandström, an associate professor of technology management at Linnaeus University in Sweden, told me.

Quebec’s public-money investments in Northvolt tell a similar cautionary tale. As someone who knows these things told me recently, Quebec public pension fund manager La Caisse de dépôt invested $200-million in Northvolt largely because others, including the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, had already done so. This sounds less like sound investment strategy than dumb money FOMO.

La Caisse has poured roughly the same kind of money into a buzzy sector before, with similarly disastrous results. In October 2021, it invested US$150 million in crypto lender Celsius, while hailing the company as “the leading global cryptocurrency earning and borrowing platform.”Celsius collapsed nine months later. The result? La Caisse wrote off its investment and swore off crypto for good. Will Northvolt’s demise trigger a similar reticence for cleantech investment? Well, Northvolt’s $200-million black eye certainly doesn’t help.

Northvolt’s would-be Quebec home, those 171 barren hectares, also sets a bad precedent. The company was not only able to secure the land with a Quebec government-backed loan; it also circumvented a strict environmental review normally conducted for such massive infrastructure projects.

The land was cleared of trees and protesting environmentalists as a result, all for a $7-billion battery production facility that will never be built. This sends a perverse message to the world: Quebec will roll out the red carpet and ignore its own environmental laws, as long as you’re selling something big, expensive and dripping with hype.

As Europe’s EV battery pioneer, Northvolt sold investors on a compelling narrative. It would challenge China’s dominance in the sector while respecting the environmental norms, democratic ideals and European standards. This narrative has since turned on itself. If anything, Northvolt’s demise has reinforced China’s lock on the market, and rendered cleantech investors gun shy on the prospect of challenging it again.

A Closer Look at the Fastest Growing Jobs

Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the jobs below are projected to grow the fastest from 2024 to 2034.

Job% Change, 2024–2034PMedian Annual Wage in 2024 Wind Turbine Techs50%$62,580 Solar Panel Installers42%$51,860 Nurse Practitioners40%$129,210 Data Scientists34%$112,590 Cybersecurity Analysts29%$124,910 Healthcare Managers23%$117,960 Physical Therapist Assistants22%$65,510 Actuaries22%$125,770 Operations Analysts22%$91,290 Physician Assistants20%$133,260

The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects wind turbine service technicians will see the highest growth. This is because demand for electricity fuels the need for wind turbines to be installed and maintained. Also within the realm of renewable energy, solar panel installers could grow quickly given lower costs and leasing options that eliminate upfront installation expenses.

Both of these roles pay more than the overall median wage of $49,500 in 2024, but less than other jobs on the list.

Growth in Healthcare

Four of the fastest growing jobs are related to healthcare, with this change fueled by the rise of chronic diseases and an aging population. In fact, adults over age 65 make up close to a quarter of the population in some states.

While three of the four medical roles involve the direct care of patients, healthcare managers are responsible for planning, directing, and coordinating health services. Their tasks typically include things like helping develop healthcare goals, ensuring facilities follow regulations, and preparing and monitoring budgets.

Momentum in Math and Computers

The remaining fastest growing jobs are in math and computer-related fields. Of these roles, actuaries have the highest median salary.

As risks and the amount of data increases, actuaries play a key role in helping companies manage their own risk. They may also work at insurance companies to analyze data and project future risks and costs.

Meanwhile, experts predict both data scientists and operations analysts will see strong growth as the amount of data increases and the demand for actionable insights rises.

Data scientists typically collect data, create algorithms and computer models, visualize findings, and make business recommendations. They typically need to be able to write code and develop statistical models, and therefore command a higher salary than operations analysts.",https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Fastest-Growing-Jobs_Terzo_Share.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 17:05:17.996702

Corporate sustainability-driven R&D partnerships are emerging as the primary catalysts for sector growth, combining technological innovation, financial scale, and policy alignment to overcome historical barriers. For investors, this convergence of factors presents a compelling opportunity to capitalize on a market poised for exponential expansion.

Corporate R&D Partnerships: The Innovation Engine

Leading energy firms are redefining the LDES landscape through strategic collaborations that prioritize sustainability and scalability. EDF, for instance, has partnered with Skytree and Return Carbon to develop direct air capture (DAC) facilities in Texas, targeting the removal of 500,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually while advancing hydrogen and compressed air storage technologies [1]. Similarly, RWE’s alliance with HPE and Nvidia leverages AI-driven weather modeling to optimize renewable energy generation and grid efficiency, reflecting a shift toward data-centric operational intelligence [2]. These partnerships are not merely incremental—they are reengineering the economics of energy storage by reducing capital risks and accelerating industrialization.

IBU-tec’s collaboration with Volkswagen’s PowerCo and Wanhua Chemical exemplifies this trend. By co-developing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode materials, the partnership secured EUR 6 million in contracts and enabled the production of IBUvolt® LMFP Gen0, a high-energy-density variant that reduces reliance on commoditized materials [3]. Such innovations directly align with the European Union’s battery sovereignty goals and net-zero targets, underscoring the role of R&D partnerships in bridging technological gaps while capturing premium pricing.

Policy-Driven Scaling and Market Dynamics

Government policies are amplifying the impact of corporate R&D efforts. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been a game-changer, with investment tax credits for standalone energy storage reducing project costs by 40% in 2024 and spurring deployments of non-lithium LDES technologies [4]. For example, Form Energy’s iron-air battery projects and Quinbrook’s 8-hour battery storage with CATL in Australia highlight how policy incentives are de-risking high-capex ventures. The IRA’s support has also driven global average turnkey energy storage system prices down, making LDES more accessible to utilities and developers [5].

Quantifiable metrics further validate the sector’s growth trajectory. The stationary energy storage market, valued at USD 66.47 billion in 2025, is projected to surge to USD 293.59 billion by 2032, with a 23.64% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) [6]. This expansion is fueled by utilities like NextEra Energy, which deployed 6.3 GWh of ESS batteries with Samsung SDI in 2025, and Platte River Power Authority’s 100 MW/400 MWh lithium iron phosphate project in Colorado [7]. These deployments are not isolated successes but part of a broader industry shift toward energy storage as a core infrastructure asset.

ROI and Risk Mitigation in R&D Collaborations

Investors are increasingly prioritizing partnerships that demonstrate clear return on investment (ROI) and risk mitigation. VFlowTech’s USD 20.5 million funding round in 2025, backed by Granite Asia and EDBI, illustrates this dynamic. The capital is scaling vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) deployments across 10 countries, leveraging AI-driven energy management to enhance grid stability [8]. Similarly, LG Energy Solution’s $5.5 billion cylindrical battery plant in Arizona, supported by partnerships with Hyundai and Honda, has expanded its production capacity to 67 GWh by 2026 while targeting 100% renewable energy by 2030 [9]. These cases highlight how R&D partnerships reduce technical and financial uncertainties, enabling scalable commercialization.

Challenges remain, including high upfront costs and regulatory fragmentation. However, the sector’s resilience is evident in its ability to attract private capital. Energy Vault’s 37% increase in S&P Global ESG scores and $954 million project backlog demonstrate how sustainability-focused innovation can command premium valuations [10].

The Future of LDES: A Call to Action for Investors

The strategic case for investing in LDES innovation is unambiguous. Corporate R&D partnerships are not only advancing technologies like flow batteries, thermal storage, and AI-optimized grids but also aligning with global decarbonization mandates. As the International Energy Agency notes, LDES deployment must increase from 27 GW in 2021 to 358 GW by 2030 to meet net-zero targets [11]. This requires sustained investment in partnerships that combine technical expertise, policy agility, and market foresight.

For investors, the path forward is clear: prioritize firms and consortia that demonstrate measurable impact on cost reduction, deployment rates, and carbon removal. The energy transition is no longer a distant vision—it is a present-day imperative, and LDES is its linchpin.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 19:04:08.126291

It's the latest in a series of compact affordable electric concept cars from the German automaker that also includes the ID Polo GTI and ID Every1, and it's based on an improved version of VW's Modular Electric Matrix or MEB platform called MEB +. The front-wheel-drive ID Cross concept is meant to be a preview of a production version of the car that will go on sale in Europe next summer, though no U.S. sales plans have been announced as of now.

The concept is about the same width as the current Taos and its wheelbase is only about three-inches shorter, but it is 10-inches shorter overall and rides on 21-inch wheels, giving it a significant visual presence without being overly large. Volkswagen's head of design Andreas Mindt says the ID Cross debuts a new design language for the brand, called 'Pure Positive,' which will show on all new future VWs. Mercifully, Volkswagen appears to have learned from its button-eliminating sins, since the ID Cross concept has more physical controls than the brand's current models, and four dedicated window switches.

That puts transmission at the center of making sure we can say “yes” to these opportunities while maintaining reliability across the grid.
What are the biggest pressures on Michigan’s grid today compared to five or ten years ago?
Reliability has always been our calling card, and our customers should continue to expect the same strong performance we’ve delivered since ITC took over Michigan’s electric transmission system in 2003.
About ITC ITC Michigan is composed of two operating companies: ITCTransmission and Michigan Electric Transmission Company (METC).","As Michigan stands at one of the most transformative junctures in its energy history, its electric grid faces extraordinary pressure from escalating demands — spanning data centers, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and new industrial ventures — while striving toward an ambitious target of 100% carbon neutrality by 2050.

To unpack what this means for businesses, residents and Michigan’s economy, Crain’s Content Studio sat down with Brian Slocum, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at ITC Holdings Corp., the largest independent electricity transmission company in the U.S. Headquartered in Novi, ITC is central to delivering reliable power to communities and industries.

Why do you describe this as a pivotal moment for Michigan’s electric grid?

We’re seeing changes unlike anything since the introduction of home air conditioning in the 1950s and ’60s. The pace and size of demand are accelerating — whether it’s AI, data centers, electric vehicles or onshoring of industry, we need reliable energy to succeed. Load growth is happening faster and on a larger scale than ever before. That puts transmission at the center of making sure we can say “yes” to these opportunities while maintaining reliability across the grid.

What are the biggest pressures on Michigan’s grid today compared to five or ten years ago?

The sheer volume of demand is the biggest pressure. This level of demand is straining supply chains, resulting in five years or more to procure some of the equipment needed to build reliable transmission. At ITC, we’re focused on how quickly we can grow capacity without sacrificing reliability. That includes using the equipment we have on hand today to support vital economic development and working with partners like the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to identify future sites for infrastructure growth. We’re also prioritizing locations where infrastructure is already in place to support new or expanding current loads, whether for a manufacturing plant or a data center. Reliability has always been our calling card, and our customers should continue to expect the same strong performance we’ve delivered since ITC took over Michigan’s electric transmission system in 2003.

Michigan has set a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. What role does transmission play in achieving that?

Transmission is the bridge between generation and reliable use of electricity. Our engineers run studies to determine what upgrades will be required to integrate solar, wind and battery projects. Through long-range planning efforts, we look 10+ years ahead to evaluate generation goals and projected load growth. The truth is, without transmission, renewable energy can’t reach the businesses and communities that need it.

Data centers, particularly those housing artificial intelligence, are being called game-changers. How significant is this trend?

Very significant. To give context, Michigan’s average peak daily electricity demand during the summer months is around 20 gigawatts. Right now, DTE Energy alone is in advanced discussions for more than 3 gigawatts of new data center load, with another 4 gigawatts in the pipeline. Consumers Energy has also seen another gigawatt in requests, and more in the pipeline. These projects represent a massive increase in demand. AI-driven centers are especially energy-intensive — up to 10 times the computing power of traditional data centers in the same footprint. Our job is to move quickly: answer customers, assess if the system can handle it and get projects built. That’s why Michigan is in a race for these new loads to locate here, and that’s why planning and investment are so critical at this moment. Customers are looking for the speed of connection, while meeting their reliability needs.

Beyond demand, what other challenges are you most focused on — cybersecurity, weather resilience?

Both are top of mind. Since 2008, ITC has operated under strict NERC standards for cybersecurity, with a cyber operations center working alongside our control room to monitor threats. On the weather side, we’ve rebuilt and modernized infrastructure that in some cases was over a century old. That investment has already paid off. For example, during the Petoskey-to-Alpena ice storm last spring, rebuilt lines held up and our transmission system was restored within days. We’re also looking forward, studying climate impacts so we can reinforce vulnerable areas before problems occur.

What should Michigan residents and business leaders know about the state of the grid right now?

First, they should be proud. Companies are choosing Michigan because of the reliability of our grid, and that’s a real competitive advantage. Second, they should recognize that electricity powers everything we do. To keep pace with growth, we’ll need support from businesses, residents, landowners and policymakers to make the infrastructure investments required. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for economic growth, and the grid is the foundation that makes it possible.

However, the pace of growth keeps me up at night. These projects take years to build, and we need to find ways to move faster. But what gives me optimism is that Michigan is already reaping the benefits of ITC’s investments over the past 22 years. We have a strong foundation. If we keep building on that foundation — together — I believe we can meet this moment and power the state’s future.

More From Our Experts

The Trump administration is pulling back sharply on large-scale projects that demonstrate cutting-edge energy technologies. Unless Congress steps in forcefully to preserve the program which a bipartisan majority funded just four years ago, the cuts will slow the global response to climate change and hurt U.S. competitiveness in emerging energy technologies. China, meanwhile, is stepping up its investments and seeking to extend its technological lead.

Why governments should invest in demonstration projects

More on:

Energy and Climate Policy

Renewable Energy

United States

Many of the technologies that large-scale demonstration projects would advance, such as new kinds of nuclear reactors or steel mills, could ultimately pay off for society, but the risks and costs of their first iterations are usually too steep even for very risk-tolerant capitalists to take on. Government investment in demonstration projects plugs the gap left by private investors.

Scale and complexity are the roots of this problem. Large scale makes power plants and industrial facilities economical, enabling them to supply electricity and goods that are vital to society at low costs. The same features create barriers to innovation. The first full-scale nuclear reactor or steel plant of its type probably won’t run as smoothly or affordably as the older ones their builders hope to replace, even if the new ones have passed smaller-scale tests with flying colors. Moreover, potential competitors can sit back and learn from the first movers without risking a penny.

As a result, private investors frequently take a pass on staking hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars on demonstration projects. Yet the societal benefits of advancing these technologies can be large. A hefty fraction of the emissions that drive global climate change come from large-scale facilities. The innovations that could drastically reduce their emissions may have additional benefits, such as greater affordability or security. Government funding that bridges the so-called “demonstration valley of death” [PDF] can give domestic pioneers in these emerging sectors a leg up on their competitors abroad.

Gaps in the global portfolio

The United States, the European Union, and fifteen other nations responded to this challenge in September 2022 by pledging $94 billion in public funding to support large-scale demonstration projects during the current decade. This amount exceeded the $90 billion that the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated [PDF] would be needed to stay on its roadmap to net-zero emissions. However, as we show in a recent analysis, “the combined effort of pledged countries is falling far short of the pledge’s goal.”

Technological progress in the global demonstration project portfolio has been uneven as well. The IEA’s net-zero scenario highlighted eleven technology areas, ranging from synthetic fuels to small modular nuclear reactors. More than 80 percent of projects and funding tracked by the IEA have flowed to only four of these eleven: biofuels; carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS); offshore wind; and hydrogen production, storage, and transportation.

Energy and Climate Policy

United States

Some of the neglected areas are big contributors to climate change. For example, the steel industry, which causes 7 percent of global emissions, is the focus of only two projects. Similarly, international shipping, which causes another 3 percent, accounts for just two as well. Emissions from such sectors are not going to decline unless demonstration projects show that innovative clean technologies are technically viable and have a plausible pathway to affordability.

The United States’ Pullback

The United States committed $21.9 billion to the September 2022 pledge, comprising the entire budget of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) in the Department of Energy (DOE), which Congress had set up the year before. By the end of the Biden administration, Congress had given OCED more than $26.7 billion for large-scale projects. While some of these projects supported work in areas well-represented in the global portfolio, such as CCUS and hydrogen, others promised to fill gaps in areas like industrial decarbonization and long-duration energy storage.

The Trump administration is pulling back hard on these planned investments. In May 2025, DOE announced the cancellation of $3.7 billion awarded by OCED for industrial demonstration projects. The industries impacted included cement, fuels, chemicals, glass, and steel. The administration’s request for DOE’s fiscal year 2026 budget states that it would cancel an additional $15 billion [PDF], although the specific projects included in this proposal have not yet been identified.

The administration has also crippled DOE’s newly created capacity to manage large-scale projects. A reported 77 percent of OCED’s staff opted to leave the department voluntarily in the first few months of Trump’s term, and the office has essentially been dismantled.

OCED’s administrative record has been criticized in recent reports by DOE’s Inspector General as well as external observers. The task of overseeing billions of dollars for cutting-edge fields with very limited administrative funding, while developing project management capabilities that DOE had not previously possessed, was daunting. Some poorly designed projects were approved, and some decisions might have been rushed.

The critics have not shown that OCED made significant technical misjudgments, much less acted corruptly. Because the awards were phased, only about 3 percent of OCED’s budget has actually gone to developers, limiting the financial risk and allowing time to strengthen or drop weak projects. DOE did not provide substantial evidence, much less rigorous analysis, to back its cancellations. A review by Resources for the Future concluded that “that many of the projects that DOE canceled could have generated long-run public returns—and potential short-run financial returns...” The Energy Futures Initiative added that “canceling these awards has ripple effects. ...investors will lose faith in DOE-supported projects.”

China steps up

As the United States pulls back, China is stepping up. China already dominates key growth sectors, such as solar panels and battery manufacturing, and it is aggressively investing in emerging energy technologies. In March 2025, the central government announced 101 new demonstration projects, adding to the 47 funded last year. Iron and steel, long-duration energy storage, and the production of polysilicon (the primary material used in solar panels and semiconductors) are among the many technology areas targeted.

The United States remains engaged in some vital areas of emerging energy technologies, such as nuclear and geothermal power. The Trump administration has maintained the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, announced new initiatives to build plants at government sites, and eased licensing and permitting. China continues to invest in these areas as well. Competition between the two nations to refine and scale these technologies should accelerate innovation (although stronger international cooperation in precompetitive and non-proprietary R&D would also help).

U.S. relinquishes leadership as global gaps remain

But gaps in the global portfolio remain. Chemicals, fuels, shipping, and carbon dioxide removal are among the areas where American investment will be particularly missed. Even more important, the demise of OCED dramatically weakens the world’s capacity to identify and fill new gaps that will emerge as the economy and technology evolve in the coming decades. One of OCED’s final reports identified two dozen opportunities [PDF] that are promising now or likely to become so during this decade alone.

Over the past eighty years, federal innovation investment sparked the growth of major industries, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, the internet, and AI, to name a few. During the same time span, the United States frequently sought to mobilize international action to address collective problems. Congress carried forward these traditions when it created and funded OCED. Unless the administration can be persuaded to reverse course, the nation will relinquish both strands of global leadership this year.

Advances in Solid Oxide and Hybrid Fuel Cell Systems While PEM fuel cells dominate the market, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and hybrid configurations are gaining attention.
Hybrid fuel cell systems, which combine batteries with fuel cells, are also becoming increasingly popular.
The Road Ahead for Fuel Cell Vehicles As the world intensifies efforts to achieve net-zero emissions, fuel cell vehicles are emerging as a critical pillar of sustainable mobility.
With continued investment and technological progress, the global Fuel Cell Vehicle Market is positioned for exponential growth, offering a cleaner and more sustainable future for transportation.","Powered by hydrogen and producing only water vapor as a by-product, FCVs represent a promising alternative to reduce carbon emissions in the transportation sector. The Fuel Cell Vehicle Market has been witnessing significant advancements, driven by innovations in hydrogen technology, infrastructure development, and supportive policies across major economies.

Breakthroughs in Hydrogen Fuel Cell Efficiency

One of the most important technological developments in recent years is the improvement in fuel cell efficiency. Traditional fuel cell systems faced challenges such as limited durability and high operating costs.

Today, manufacturers are introducing next-generation proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells that operate at lower temperatures while delivering higher efficiency. These cells require less platinum catalyst, reducing costs and enhancing performance.

Improved water and thermal management systems are also enabling better fuel cell durability, allowing vehicles to operate seamlessly in diverse climates.

According to industry analysis, these efficiency gains are directly contributing to cost reduction, one of the most critical factors influencing the Fuel Cell Vehicle Market. Automakers are now producing FCVs that match or even exceed the mileage of conventional gasoline-powered cars, making them more appealing to both individual and commercial consumers.

Lightweight Materials and Advanced Design Engineering

Fuel cell vehicles require careful engineering to balance hydrogen storage, durability, and vehicle safety. Innovations in lightweight composite materials are making a significant impact on overall design. Advanced carbon fiber tanks are now being used to store hydrogen at pressures up to 700 bar, ensuring both safety and compactness.

Automotive engineers are also focusing on aerodynamics and vehicle weight reduction to improve fuel economy. By integrating lightweight aluminium and reinforced plastics into body design, manufacturers are extending driving ranges while maintaining robust safety standards. This trend is particularly critical for commercial fleets and public transport, where range and reliability play a vital role.

Expansion of Hydrogen Refueling Infrastructure

Another major innovation is the rapid expansion and digitization of hydrogen refueling networks. While limited refueling stations have historically hindered adoption, governments and private stakeholders are investing heavily in infrastructure. Digital integration allows stations to be monitored remotely, ensuring uptime, safety, and efficient fuel distribution.

Smart refueling systems, powered by AI and IoT technologies, are emerging to optimize hydrogen delivery and usage. These intelligent networks predict demand, reduce downtime, and ensure cost efficiency for station operators. Fairfield Market Research notes that these developments are instrumental in improving consumer confidence and accelerating adoption in urban and intercity transportation systems.

Advances in Solid Oxide and Hybrid Fuel Cell Systems

While PEM fuel cells dominate the market, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and hybrid configurations are gaining attention. SOFCs can operate on various fuels beyond hydrogen, including natural gas and biogas, making them versatile for multiple applications. Hybrid fuel cell systems, which combine batteries with fuel cells, are also becoming increasingly popular. This dual approach provides flexibility by offering both long driving ranges and the ability to manage peak power demands efficiently.

Integration of AI and IoT for Performance Optimization

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are playing a transformative role in enhancing fuel cell vehicle performance. AI-powered diagnostic systems are enabling real-time monitoring of critical components, predicting potential failures, and improving maintenance schedules. IoT sensors embedded across the vehicle and hydrogen supply chain are helping optimize fuel efficiency and safety.

Role of Renewable Hydrogen Production

Hydrogen’s source has long been a point of debate. Conventional hydrogen production from natural gas generates carbon emissions, undermining the sustainability of FCVs. The latest innovation involves producing hydrogen through renewable sources, such as electrolysis powered by wind, solar, or hydropower.

Green hydrogen production technologies are scaling rapidly, making the supply chain cleaner and more sustainable. In the coming years, large-scale electrolyzer projects are expected to integrate seamlessly with hydrogen refueling infrastructure, lowering costs and boosting adoption rates.

Collaborations and Strategic Investments

The pace of innovation in the FCV sector is being accelerated by collaborations between automakers, technology providers, and governments. Leading manufacturers are entering partnerships to share research, co-develop hydrogen technologies, and expand supply chains.

Joint ventures are focusing on scaling production, cutting costs, and making FCVs more accessible to consumers worldwide.

The Road Ahead for Fuel Cell Vehicles

As the world intensifies efforts to achieve net-zero emissions, fuel cell vehicles are emerging as a critical pillar of sustainable mobility. Continuous innovations—from hydrogen production and storage to AI-driven systems and lightweight materials—are creating a favorable environment for their growth. The expansion of hydrogen infrastructure and the diversification into commercial applications will further accelerate adoption.

While challenges such as high production costs and limited infrastructure remain, ongoing research and collaborative initiatives are steadily addressing these barriers. With continued investment and technological progress, the global Fuel Cell Vehicle Market is positioned for exponential growth, offering a cleaner and more sustainable future for transportation.",https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/fairfield.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 17:06:36.204444

Autoguide reported on a patent application from the automaker’s American arm, FCA, which covers a high-performance electric drive axle with three separate power units.

Three motors on one axle is a pretty rare setup, as most automakers opt for two. FCA’s goal with the technology is to allow a greater range of speed to each drive wheel, and the system functions similarly to a two-speed transmission. The outside motors take over for the center motor at a certain speed and continue accelerating.

Stellantis claims power outputs of up to around 470 horsepower for each motor, which would mean a combined output of 1,341 horsepower. This is just a patent application, so there’s no word on how or where the axle could be used, but it’s reasonable to guess that we’ll see a souped-up version of the Dodge Charger EV at some point.

The electric axle could also make its way to a future electrified Ram truck, and it’s likely possible to incorporate two of the units for a beastly all-wheel drive setup, though each motor’s power output would probably not reach the full 470 horsepower in that sort of configuration.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla's (TSLA) U.S. market share dropped to a near eight-year low in August as buyers chose electric vehicles from a growing stable of rivals over the aging lineup offered by CEO Elon Musk's company, according to data from research firm Cox Automotive shared exclusively with Reuters.

The decline highlights the threat from automakers ramping up EV incentives at a difficult time for the industry. Analysts expect an EV sales bump to continue through September in the United States, then drop when federal tax credits expire at the end of the month, raising financial pressure on Tesla and other automakers.

Tesla, which once held more than 80% of the U.S. EV market, accounted for 38% of the total EV sales in the United States in August, the first time it has fallen below the 40% mark since October 2017, when it was ramping up production of the Model 3, its first mass market car, according to early data from Cox.

While other automakers are rolling out new EVs, Tesla has turned its focus to building robotaxis and humanoid robots, delaying and cancelling plans for cheaper electric vehicle models.

Much of Tesla's trillion-dollar valuation hangs on that bet. The company's board on Friday proposed an unprecedented $1 trillion pay package for Musk that, apart from other operational milestones, is pegged to Tesla's value rising to $8.5 trillion over the next decade.

For now, Tesla's core auto business remains its money maker. Its last new model was the Cybertruck pickup that rolled out in 2023 with nothing of the success of its Model 3 midsize sedan or Model Y midsize SUV. Tesla has refreshed the Model Y, once the world's best-selling car, but the changes failed to live up to expectations, and Tesla is on track toward a second year of sales decline.

""I know they're positioning themselves as a robotics, AI company. But when you're a car company, when you don't have new products, your share will start to decline,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights, said in an interview with Reuters.

The green hydrogen industry has the potential to monetize excess capacity from wind farms and solar arrays, gathering up clean kilowatts that would otherwise go to waste. That puts the industry somewhat at odds with the current state of affairs in US energy policy. Nevertheless, new ventures continue to squeeze into the market.

Green Hydrogen And The New Tax Bill

Hydrogen is the multi-tasker of the modern era, which means that the pace of global decarbonization depends on how quickly hydrogen can shake off its carbon-loaded supply chain. The primary source of hydrogen today is natural gas, with coal playing a significant but lesser part.

Non-fossil options are becoming available as new technologies emerge to extract green hydrogen from water or various bio-based resources, as well as human-made waste streams. The challenge is to bring the cost down to parity with cheap, fossil-sourced hydrogen (see lots more green H2 background here).

Cost parity has been a tough nut to crack, and the new federal tax bill didn’t make things any easier.

The Republican-controlled Senate passed a final version of the bill that wasn’t quite as bad as the initial version proposed by the Republican-controlled House, but it was bad enough. In one representative analysis, the news organization Hydrogen Insight notes that the bill “remains far less supportive than the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) ever was and is therefore unlikely to drive a similar scale of investments in US clean hydrogen production — while its impact on upstream sources of renewable energy could make it more difficult for projects to get off the ground.”

Green Hydrogen Seeks Renewable Energy

In other words, green hydrogen stakeholders are hobbled by the availability (or lack thereof) of renewable energy resources. In addition to burdensome provisions in the new tax bill, the new “American Energy Dominance” policy has also provided the President with a platform to take administrative actions against wind and solar development in the US.

However, the American Energy Dominance policy does explicitly support other forms of renewable energy, including hydropower, geothermal, and biomass. Nuclear energy has also received a big thumbs-up from the Trump administration, and the Energy Department is also moving forward with programs that support marine energy.

Though the advanced geothermal and marine options involve emerging technologies with limited application for the here and now, hydropower is a mature, available resource, and the Indiana-based global firm Cummins is taking advantage of the window. On September 3, Cummins announced that its Accelera branch has supplied a 35-megawatt electrolyzer to the UK industrial gas firm Linde to run on hydropower at its facility in Niagra Falls, New York.

“Powered by renewable hydroelectric energy, the system will generate green hydrogen to help decarbonize industrial operations and accelerate the clean energy transition in the U.S.,” Cummins explains.

Linde has been looking forward to the delivery for three years. “The new plant will be the largest electrolyzer installed by Linde globally and will more than double Linde’s green liquid hydrogen production capacity in the United States,” Linde explained in 2022. The firm cited aerospace, electronics, and manufacturing among the markets for green hydrogen, reflecting the diminished role of hydrogen fuel cells in the ground transportation sector.

Green Investors Seek Green Hydrogen

At the startup end of the scale, the Oklahoma firm Tobe Energy has leveraged the substantial oil and gas experience of its principles to develop a new low-cost electrolyzer system.

Exactly how low-cost remains to be seen, but Tobe claims that its new system can reduce operating costs by more than 50% compared to conventional systems, partly by reducing waste heat from the process. Its business model is based on turnkey, transportable electrolyzer systems for onsite use, which shaves down costly hydrogen transportation and storage expenses.

As with Cummins and Linde, Tobe identifies non-transportation markets for its green hydrogen in the near term, including steelmaking and fertilizer production. E-fuels are also in the works at some point in the future, leading to the potential for cracking into the aviation market, among others.

The latest news from Tobe cropped up on September 5, when the firm announced a $1.8 million round of seed funding. The round was spearheaded by Cortado Ventures with participation from the Scissortail and Hurricane branches of 46 VC, along with Techstars, Wavefunction VC, and a roster of angel investors.

Tobe has already laid plans for manufacturing its first 100 commercial-scale units at its plant in Oklahoma. Keep an eye out for the company’s first project, to be located at the Zeeco Advanced Research Complex in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.

If They Can’t Make It Here, They’ll Pack Up And Take It There

The clampdown on the US green hydrogen industry is too bad for the US, but there may be a silver lining for decarbonization advocates elsewhere around the globe. Earlier today, the Massachusetts green hydrogen startup Electric Hydrogen announced the acquisition of the New York hydrogen project developer Ambient Fuel, with an eye on the EU market.

Electric Hydrogen has developed a transportable electrolysis system which the company claims reduces costs by up to 60%, as well as reducing the installation timeline. The company’s hydrogen-as-a-service business model further pares down the need for a substantial upfront investment.

“Rising demand for clean hydrogen in both the U.S. and E.U. is accelerating the already fast-growing market for U.S. technology,” Electric Hydrogen explains. “Adding Ambient Fuels’ deep development expertise and portfolio of U.S. project sites will expand Electric Hydrogen’s ability to partner with customers on co-development of hydrogen projects and provide dedicated capital resources where appropriate.”

The capital end of things is supported by the leading firm Generate Capital, which has staked up to $400 million on hydrogen projects around the world. “This complementary relationship combines Electric Hydrogen’s industry leading electrolyzer technology with project financing to create attractive offerings for customers seeking the lowest levelized cost of hydrogen,” Electric Hydrogen noted in a press statement.

“Working with Electric Hydrogen, we can help solve current finance and bankability challenges and reduce LCOH, enabling more hydrogen projects to reach Final Investment Decision,” adds Scott Gosselink, Managing Director at Generate Capital.

If those FIDs don’t materialize here in the US, no worries, Electric Hydrogen is prepared to leverage RED-III, the EU’s latest Renewable Energy Directive framework, for opportunities overseas.

About That EU Green Hydrogen Market …

Despite some fits and starts, the nations of Europe continue to advocate for the growth of a robust domestic green hydrogen industry to help cut down on imports of Russian gas. Imported green hydrogen is also in play, with Canada in the running in addition to an ambitious plan to pipe it in from Egypt.

US producers may not have an opportunity to rush to supply Europe with green hydrogen, but at least firms like Electric Hydrogen can chip into the effort by supplying electrolyzers. The new RED-III framework has motivated oil and gas refiners in Europe to switch to green hydrogen, as Wood Mackenzie assessed in August.

“European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation,” the firm explained.

The affected projects are located in renewable-rich states such as Rajasthan, western Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh in central India, according to a document from the federal agency overseeing inter-state transmission access.

The grid access terminations were carried out in the June quarter after prior notices were issued to the companies, said the source, who requested anonymity as the firms are seeking relief from the federal power regulator, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC).

India's surging power demand - driven by rising incomes, mechanised farming, industrialisation, and urbanisation - has prompted New Delhi to streamline grid rules to better integrate clean energy projects and ensure uninterrupted electricity supply for its 1.4 billion people.

The country aims to have 500 GW of non-fossil fuel power capacity by 2030. However, its transmission network, spanning about 495,000 circuit kilometres, is lagging the growth in generation capacity.

The Central Transmission Utility conducted manual inspections before revoking access and will continue efforts to free up transmission lines for projects that are on track for completion, the official said.

JSW Energy appealed the revocation, but the regulator declined to grant interim relief, according to an order dated June 24, and on July 10 asked CTUIL to share its response. The petition is listed for October 7, according to orders posted on the CERC website.

He spent 25 years at ERM, a global Environmental, Health & Safety, and Sustainability consultancy, building and leading ERM’s 300+ consultant global practice for air quality and climate change services.

Gov. Tom Kean

Thomas Howard Kean served two terms as governor of New Jersey from January 1982 to January 1990.

The state’s 48th governor, he is a descendant of its very first constitutional governor, William Livingston, who was elected by the first state Legislature in August 1776.

As a former teacher, education policy was of special importance for the governor. Following the report “A Nation At Risk,” which warned of the growing threat the United States faced if the quality of education continued to decline, Kean began an even greater effort for education reform.

On the national level, Kean also was named chairman of the Education Commission of the States, a forum that allowed governors, legislators, educators and others to discuss and evaluate programs across the country. He was succeeded as chairman by then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, with whom Kean would develop a lasting friendship.

Kean’s environmental record was highlighted by his aggressive push for legislation to protect freshwater wetlands and create a buffer zone adjoining the wetlands new construction could not take place.

Employing a tactic of Governor Byrne’s in the battle to preserve the Pinelands, the Governor issued an executive order imposing a moratorium on the granting of permits in wetlands areas, thus exerting great pressure on the Legislature to take action on the pending bill.

Kean also faced repeated incidents of toxic waste spills, including a 50-mile-long slick of medical waste that washed up on the Jersey shore in the height of the summer beach season in August 1987 and the discovery of high levels of dioxin in the Ironbound section of Newark.

Public concern over the health impacts of toxic chemicals also led to the controversial enactment in August 1983 of “Right-to-Know’ law requiring manufacturers to list the chemical names of all hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals with which workers could come into contact.

Sen. Joe Kyrillos

Kyrillos concluded a 30-year career in the New Jersey Legislature in 2018. After two terms in the General Assembly, he was elected to the state Senate in 1992.

He started the consulting firm SK Partners, works with investment advisory firm Newport Capital Group, Red Bank, and is affiliated with Newmark, a global real estate company.

During a visible and productive career representing Monmouth and Middlesex counties, Kyrillos emerged as a statewide leader in job creation, economic growth, shore protection, and good government.

He serves on the boards of Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey and MIAX Emerald, chairs the advisory board of OceanFirst Bank, and on non-profit boards.

A former chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee, Kyrillos chaired Governor Christie’s 2009 campaign, two presidential campaigns, and was the 2012 Republican nominee for U.S. Senate.

With the federal EV tax credit set to expire on September 30, 2025, consumers and investors face a critical decision: act now or risk missing a window of unprecedented financial incentives and market momentum. The Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) tax credits—offering up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models—are being accelerated out of existence by President Donald Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA), signed in July 2025 [1]. This abrupt policy shift has created a surge in demand, with July 2025 EV sales hitting 130,082 units—a record for the year [2].

The Electrify Expo: A Catalyst for Urgency

The Electrify Expo 2025, held in Chicago from September 13–14, has become a linchpin in this high-stakes environment. By aligning its timing with the tax credit deadline, the event has amplified urgency for consumers to experience EVs firsthand. At the expo, Lucid, Tesla, and Rivian showcased their flagship models, each leveraging the platform to drive adoption:

- Lucid debuted public demos of its Gravity SUV, its first Midwest appearance, drawing over 3,000 visitors to a recent New York event and securing 75% of Gravity orders from new customers [3].

- Tesla highlighted its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and Model Y Robotaxi, reinforcing its dominance in innovation while capitalizing on price cuts that boosted July sales [4].

- Rivian displayed its R1T and R1S, paired with a $6,000 incentive for upgrades, directly countering the tax credit’s impending phase-out [5].

The expo’s ""Electrify Weekender"" program, which allows attendees to take home a Tesla for a weekend test drive, further reduces barriers to adoption. According to a report by Skillfusion, such initiatives contributed to a 11% year-over-year surge in U.S. EV sales in Q1 2025 [6].

The Tax Credit Cliff: A Race Against Time

The IRS’s recent clarification that a binding contract with a payment made by September 30 qualifies for the tax credit—even if delivery occurs afterward—has added nuance to the deadline [1]. However, state registration deadlines and automaker production timelines create ambiguity. For example, Lucid’s Gravity SUV, which saw 58% year-over-year delivery growth in Q1 2025 [3], may face delays for buyers in states with October registration cycles.

Investors must also consider automakers’ responses to the tax credit’s expiration. Lucid has announced a $7,500 rebate for the Gravity SUV to offset the loss of incentives [7], while Rivian’s promotional offers signal a strategic pivot to retain market share. Tesla, despite a 12.6% Q2 2025 U.S. sales dip, remains the category leader, outselling the next ten brands combined [8].

The Investment Case: Why Timing is Everything

The convergence of policy shifts, consumer behavior, and corporate strategy creates a compelling case for immediate action. Here’s why:

1. Short-Term Surge in Demand: With 300,000 new EVs sold in Q1 2025 alone [6], the market is primed for a pre-deadline rush. Automakers like Lucid and Rivian are scaling production to meet this demand, with Lucid reporting an 83% year-over-year increase in Q2 2025 production [3].

2. Price Competitiveness: Post-September 30, EVs will lose their $7,500 tax credit discount. Companies offering rebates (e.g., Lucid’s $7,500) or incentives (e.g., Rivian’s $6,000) are effectively bridging this gap, but such offers may not persist indefinitely.

3. Supply Chain Resilience: The tax credit’s expiration has already caused uncertainty in battery manufacturing. Investors should prioritize companies with robust domestic supply chains, such as Tesla’s Gigafactories or Rivian’s partnerships with battery suppliers.

Conclusion: Seize the Window

The Electrify Expo 2025 and the looming tax credit expiration have created a perfect storm of urgency and opportunity. For investors, the message is clear: act before September 30 to capitalize on discounted EV purchases and the market’s pre-deadline momentum. Lucid, Tesla, and Rivian are each navigating this transition with strategic rebates, innovations, and promotional offers—but the window for tax-advantaged purchases is rapidly closing.

Currently, India has about 44GW of renewable projects pending firm power supply agreements.
Oyster Renewable Energy noted that the lower tax rate would enable developers to renegotiate with utilities for more competitive tariffs, potentially freeing up projects.
This move is expected to bolster India's renewable energy sector, which has recently surpassed 100GW of solar PV module manufacturing capacity under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers.
""India reduces GST on renewable energy components to 5%"" was originally created and published by Power Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.","The Indian government has reduced the goods and services tax (GST) on solar photovoltaic (PV) modules and wind turbine generators from 12% to 5%.

This move is expected to decrease the capital cost for solar and wind power projects by approximately 5% and accelerate the country's transition to renewable energy, reported Reuters, citing industry experts.

The tax cut is part of a broader initiative to reduce taxes on hundreds of consumer items and is aligned with India's goal to expand its non-fossil fuel capacity to 500GW by 2030.

Currently, India has about 44GW of renewable projects pending firm power supply agreements.

ICRA senior vice-president and group head Girishkumar Kadam emphasised that “the tax cut for solar PV modules and wind turbine generators is expected to reduce the capital cost for solar and wind power projects by about 5%.”

This reduction in costs is, however, likely to put pressure on existing project developers to offer more competitive tariffs.

Projects awarded before the tax cut may need to renegotiate existing power supply contracts to reflect the new rates.

However, the tax change also introduces “a few short-term challenges,” according to EY India tax and new energy partner Saurabh Agarwal.

Oyster Renewable Energy noted that the lower tax rate would enable developers to renegotiate with utilities for more competitive tariffs, potentially freeing up projects.

For developers who have not yet procured equipment, it is expected that they will pass on the tax benefits to consumers through reduced tariffs.

Those who have already paid the higher rate can maintain their current tariff agreements by providing relevant documentation to the federal regulator, explained Hexa Climate Solutions founder and executive chairman Sanjeev Aggarwal.

Waaree Energies, a solar equipment manufacturer, has confirmed that it will pass on the benefits of the tax reduction to its customers.

This move is expected to bolster India's renewable energy sector, which has recently surpassed 100GW of solar PV module manufacturing capacity under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers.

Fred Malo Jr., Carbondale Hershey’s claims require clarity Tony Hershey, perhaps it’s time to take a break from your weekly claims of persecution by local government.","Get rid of the middle man

Where do you think all that energy in those precious fossil fuels comes from initially? The sun, that’s where. Old Sol injects the Earth’s flora and fauna with the building blocks of life. When these life forms die and become fossilized, they take the elements with them.

Why not get your energy directly from the source? Solar panels make so much sense. Getting your power from fossil fuels is like getting your protein from meat rather than directly from plants in the ground. That’s inefficient and expensive.

So are fossil fuels. Solar is much cheaper than methane gas. There are no solar plants and the fuel is free. Methane gas plants have to purchase their fuel. Coal, of course, is way more expensive than everything.

And that’s just through the grid. Imagine every all-electric building having its own solar power source. After some initial expense, you have no utility bills.

Go solar.

Hershey’s claims require clarity

Tony Hershey, perhaps it’s time to take a break from your weekly claims of persecution by local government. You’ve served on the Aspen and Glenwood Springs city councils. You currently sit on the Garfield County Library Board and work as an assistant district attorney. Yet you continually portray yourself as a victim of the very “deep state” you are deeply embedded in.

In your most recent letter, you accused the city of lying to smear your ethics and character and to intimidate you into silence. You described their sworn affidavits and legal filings to the Secretary of State as “slanderous.” As an attorney, you surely know that to prove slander, the statements must be false, communicated to a third party, stated as fact, and demonstrably damaging.

If you truly believe the city has defamed you by knowingly false court filings, that is not just unethical — it could be criminal. Your boss, District Attorney Ben Sollars, would be obligated to investigate potential perjury. At the very least, you should pursue civil action to defend your reputation. Failing to do so raises questions about the strength of your claims.

On the other hand, if the allegations made by Mr. Williams are accurate — that you disclosed privileged information about ongoing legal cases involving minors, including names, locations, and investigative methods — then you and Mr. Sollars owe the public a serious explanation.

This community deserves clarity. Either these allegations are false and legally actionable, or they’re true and require accountability. If no investigation is launched, no lawsuit filed, and no response offered, then the Colorado Bar Association should indeed review these matters and determine whether you should continue to serve the public in a position of legal trust.

Now is the time to clear the air — or take responsibility.

The recycle/compost dilemma

I think our society is getting the wrong idea when it comes to recycling. Is it a good thing? Absolutely, especially compared to dumping it in the landfill. But many of us have questioned whether the items we put in our recycling bins actually get recycled. After it leaves our curb and leaves the valley, what truly happens to it? There have been some investigative reports that say it never gets recycled. We don’t know for sure.

By no means am I saying that we shouldn’t continue recycling and composting, but we can do better. Especially our local restaurants that have converted to compostable and recyclable containers to serve their food in. Understandable for to-go orders, but if the customer is going to sit down in your establishment and dine in, they should get real plates and silverware that can be washed and reused. Yes, this will cost the restaurant owner more, but it is the right thing to do. And I would be willing to bet that most people in our valley would be willing to pay a little more to help take care of our planet.

This goes for us at home as well. Don’t use throwaway items just because it is easier. Keeping things in-house is the best way to help preserve our natural surroundings. If everyone does their part, we can make a difference.

Immigrants and workers deserve support

I am proud of my town, Carbondale, folks in the Roaring Fork Valley, and the state of Colorado, who showed up for Labor Day rallies to support our workers. I hope everyone will contact their elected officials whenever issues arise that affect workers.

These include immigrants, who are vital to our community, state, and national economies. Trump and his administration are attacking these workers, who help make America great by harvesting our crops, maintaining our landscaping, caring for our children, keeping our homes clean, and preparing our food in restaurants. The list goes on and on. We should be grateful for and respect them.

Like many others, I am the granddaughter of immigrants who came to America to seek a better life for their families, especially their children. Is it fair to deny these hardworking people the opportunities that many of us had?

In addition to supporting our immigrants, we should stand up against the massive firings of our federal workers — from the EPA, FEMA, CDC and other agencies — who keep our country safe. They have been replaced with workers, some at top levels of our federal government, who are not qualified to oversee the departments and agencies they lead. How does this make us greater or safer?

Not only are individuals traumatized by deportations and dismissals, so are their families and communities. If you think it can’t happen here, it already has.

Previously, these groups were excluded from claiming clean energy tax credits because they didn’t owe federal income tax.
While Elective Pay provides a one-time federal tax refund after installation, the long-term energy savings are where the true value lies.
To assist organizations in navigating the Elective Pay process, the Michigan Infrastructure Office’s Technical Assistance Center (TAC) offers no-cost support.
Kris Brady, director of TAC, has been leading TAC’s effort to help Michigan nonprofits navigate Elective Pay since October 2023.","Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and a federal program called Elective Pay, the Humane Society of Huron Valley (HSHV) has taken a major step toward financial sustainability and environmental responsibility. The Superior Township-based nonprofit recently completed the installation of 474 rooftop solar panels — an initiative that is already reducing operational costs and enabling the organization to reinvest more deeply in animal welfare and community programs.

HSHV Chief Financial Officer Jonathon Trevathan first learned about Elective Pay in 2022. Elective Pay, established through IRA, was designed to make federal clean energy incentives accessible to nonprofits, tribal governments, municipalities, schools, and other tax-exempt organizations. Previously, these groups were excluded from claiming clean energy tax credits because they didn’t owe federal income tax. Now, under Elective Pay, they can receive up to 30% of their eligible clean energy project costs as a cash refund from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These incentives are activated by the installation of qualifying clean energy technologies, including solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicle charging stations, and geothermal systems.

Trevathan and his colleagues at HSHV seized the opportunity they saw in the program. HSHV’s solar panels, installed by Ann Arbor-based Homeland Solar, were up and running in under two weeks — a process Trevathan describes as “seamless.” More importantly, the financial impact was immediate. While Elective Pay provides a one-time federal tax refund after installation, the long-term energy savings are where the true value lies.

Over the next 25 years, HSHV is projected to save approximately $850,000 on energy costs. That money can now be directed toward critical services such as grief counseling, pet ownership education, emergency sheltering, foster care, and veterinary treatment. For HSHV, the transition to solar is more than a sustainability win — it’s a strategic investment in HSHV’s mission.

But for Trevathan, one initiative holds particular importance: keeping pets in loving homes during times of financial hardship.

“We’ve got a Bountiful Bowls program where you can come and collect food a couple times a month to help feed your animals,” he says. “If you love this animal, and this animal loves you, let’s keep it in your family. Having $850,000 more can really allow us to be generous in that way.”

Trevathan says the benefits of the Elective Pay program extend far beyond this one project. He says he would “absolutely” encourage other nonprofits to look into the program.

“Even without the [tax] credits, I think it largely makes sense,” he says.

To assist organizations in navigating the Elective Pay process, the Michigan Infrastructure Office’s Technical Assistance Center (TAC) offers no-cost support. Through a combination of informational webinars, one-on-one consulting, and accounting guidance, the TAC helps applicants — many of whom are working through the refund process for the first time — to successfully access Elective Pay benefits.

Kris Brady, director of TAC, has been leading TAC’s effort to help Michigan nonprofits navigate Elective Pay since October 2023. Her mission goes beyond paperwork; it’s about making sure organizations know this resource exists and understand how to use it.

“We’ve been out and about, explaining that this program is available through the tax refund process with the IRS,” Brady says. “A lot of the time eligible folks for Elective Pay are nonprofits and they’ve never filed taxes and think a tax refund is not something they would be eligible for. There is a lot of public outreach to get folks to understand that if they’ve done one of these projects, they could get a refund of a portion of what they invested.”

Still, changes are on the horizon. According to Brady, the recently passed federal budget reconciliation bill has affected the Elective Pay program by tightening implementation timelines and removing some incentives altogether. However, she emphasizes that nonprofits still have another 10 months to take advantage of Elective Pay incentives.

“My best advice for folks that are planning projects is to reach out to the Technical Assistance Center,” she says. “We encourage these clean energy transition projects to continue. It’s important to realize that Michigan did not abandon its Healthy Climate goals and we are striving to meet those even though some of these tools might be changing.”

Among TAC’s newest initiatives is the Elective Pay Ambassador Program, a community-based effort that places trained ambassadors with organizations across Michigan to support clean energy project planning. TAC also offers the Unlocking Elective Pay Challenge, a competitive grant opportunity.

“We are all still dedicated to the mission and we will make it work one way or another,” Brady says.",https://d3ggs9wi9hwg8r.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/08125623/Huron-Valley-Humane-Society-Jonathan-Trevathan-Mast-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 14:05:31.317575

A powerful shift is on the horizon, and drivers will soon see the difference as the next wave of cars hits the road.

The automaker is bringing its motorsports and performance operations under one roof with the launch of Ford Racing, a new division created on 4 September.

The move will unite race cars, road cars, customer experiences and global branding in a single business, designed to inject cutting-edge racing technology directly into everyday vehicles.

Ford Racing will be based in Dearborn, Michigan, where teams once split between production and motorsports will now collaborate more closely.

Executives said the shake-up will boost profits and create a powerful “halo effect” around the brand, connecting the thrill of the racetrack to what ends up in dealerships.

“We’re building this as a major business within Ford Motor Co.,” Will Ford, general manager of Ford Racing Global, told the Detroit Free Press.

“It’s a commitment to racing and finding the product opportunities that arise from those racing efforts in an all-encompassing way, to an extent we’ve never really done before.”

Return to F1

The timing comes as Ford ramps up for a return to Formula One and prepares to compete at world-famous races from Le Mans to the Baja 1,000.

Lessons learned on those grueling circuits will feed straight into models like the Mustang GTD and the Raptor pickup.

Ford also confirmed that the revamped division will expand into new areas, including merchandise and customer experiences, ensuring the Ford Racing name becomes a visible part of its global brand.

“The team will be focused on winning on the track and creating performance across the lineup,” Ford told the Detroit Free Press.

he added that racing technology will “trickle down to the entire family of Ford products.”

With rivals circling the off-road and performance markets, Ford’s rebrand signals an aggressive push to keep the Blue Oval at the front of the pack.

Ford's leaked plans

Drivers are all revved up over the potential return of a beloved old Ford model after a mysterious trademark filing.

The auto giant announced last month that the brand is going ""back to its roots"" by making cars more affordable as the company develops a new electric vehicle platform.

Then speculation began swirling in early August, when Ford filed a request to trademark the word Ranchero.

Ranchero was a car-based pickup sold from the 1950s through the 1970s, which was popular for its pickup-like bed on a station wagon platform.

In Ford's new filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office, the Ranchero name is trademarked when referring to pick-up trucks, electric cars, and electric vehicles.

Now, Ford fans are convinced the brand's highly anticipated new pickup will be called a Ranchero.

However, there will be one key difference in the model from 75 years ago with the one expected in 2027: it'll be much more modern.

Instead of the fan-favorite fuel system that drivers might be used to, the new Ford pickup will be an electric vehicle.

Ford is investing billions of dollars in a new EV platform in an attempt to compete with China's output.

CEO Jim Farley said last month that the plan to switch gears to electric is a ""risky bet,"" but that he believes it'll pay off.

Ford is set to debut a new EV mid-size pickup truck that will start at around $30,000, Farley said.

The four-door vehicle will be built entirely in the United States and will be available in 2027.

Farley said the plan is ""the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T.""

Part of the reason why the Ranchero was so popular was that it had the comfort of a car but the usefulness of a truck.

It was discontinued in 1979 for reasons including declining sales and stricter government regulations.

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices have been shown to both increase soil organic carbon (SOC) inputs and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGnet).","A study using multiple agronomic models to examine two long-term agricultural research stations in North America shows that so-called climate-smart agricultural practices – like no-till treatments, cover-crop utilization and residue retention – can help promote carbon sequestration in soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The findings show that using a combination of models – rather than just one – can provide a more realistic range of outcomes and can highlight the shortcomings of individual models.

“We targeted open-source data from long-term agricultural experiments in Michigan and Texas that are very different – with different climates, soils and crops grown,” said Debjani Sihi, the senior author of a paper describing the research and a member of NC State’s Plant Sciences Initiative. “By utilizing these long-term studies, we wanted to see what the future might look like in terms of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions.

“We examined three different models developed by different research groups and looked at them collectively,” said Sihi, an assistant professor with joint appointments in NC State’s Department of Plant and Microbial Biology and Department of Crop and Soil Sciences. “The architecture is a little different in these models. What can we learn from each of the models, and what is the collective information?”

The study examined data from more than three decades at the two agricultural experimental sites and calibrated it into a “model ensemble” to make future predictions. The ensemble examined both individual climate-smart agricultural practices and practices that were “stacked,” or added to each other.

The researchers then examined whether these proposed practices would, in the next 25 years or so, generate carbon sequestration in soil and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in two different scenarios: a baseline scenario that replicated climate-change historical data of the past three decades, and a “worst-case” scenario that envisions dramatic growth in greenhouse gas emissions.

“We tried to capture a variety of biological processes related to soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (methane and nitrous oxide) emission while also accounting for climate-change effects,” Sihi said. “These processes are driven by different climate variables like temperature and precipitation.”

The model ensemble showed some positive effects in both studied locations under the baseline scenario.

“At the Michigan site, we found that no-till farming and keeping crop residues on the field increased soil carbon sequestration, while using no-till farming, some cover crops, and reducing fertilizer decreased greenhouse gas emissions,” Sihi said. “At the Texas site, most of the farming practices we tried increased soil carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emissions stayed about the same. However, the models indicated that not plowing alone could reverse greenhouse gas emissions.”

The worst-case scenario, however, lived up to its name in the study.

“We also found that all the climate-smart farming practices performed worse under worst-case scenario climate change, which was expected,” Sihi said.

She added that the study could provide the impetus for other researchers to try out the model ensemble approach and improve it. Future studies could be improved by using real-world data from on-farm studies and selecting other models with different strengths to broaden the insights.

“We hope others will evaluate these climate-smart practices to learn which may be more important, and what kind of experiments that we can leverage,” Sihi said. “These are two long-term examples in Michigan and Texas that we have utilized, so that others could adopt and improve and build on it.

“In this context, utilizing no-till or cover crops as a base practice and then stacking residue retention reduced future net emissions. Future work would need more study in other parts of the country – or world – to better generalize effects.”

Abstract: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction efforts are underway to mitigate climate change worldwide. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices have been shown to both increase soil organic carbon (SOC) inputs and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGnet). We evaluated the GHGnet of several management practices with three biogeochemical models (APSIM, Daycent, and RothC) at two sites with contrasting soils, climates, and cropping systems. Additionally, two future climate scenarios (baseline and high-emissions) provided alternative outcomes of SOC, N2O, and CH4 by 2050. In Michigan, most biochar and residue retention with no-till treatments increased SOC stocks; leguminous cover crops, no-till, and reducing fertilizer input lowered N2O emissions. The lowest biochar treatment lowered GHGnet in the baseline climate scenario, but all other management treatments increased GHGnet under both baseline and high emissions, and all management scenarios increased a mean of 8.0 Mg CO2-equivalent GHG (CO2e) ha?1 from baseline to high emissions. Conversely, in Texas, most treatments increased SOC, and N2O was relatively constant. Every no-till treatment reversed GHGnet in both the baseline and high-emissions climate scenarios but all management scenarios increased a mean of 0.6 Mg CO2e ha?1 under high emissions. At both sites under high-emissions climate change, cover crops and no-till resulted in the lowest GHGnet overall. Overall, the study showed that no-till, especially with residue retention, and cover crops are important CSA practices to lower the GHGnet of agriculture, but there remains much room to find even more effective solutions to adapt to climate change.",https://cals.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mksihimodel1500-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 15:06:33.038648

OLYMPIA, Wash. – The Washington State Department of Commerce delivered $41.1 million to 49 Clean Energy Community Grants awards in 22 counties this year. The grants will support projects such as rooftop solar, battery storage, decarbonization efforts, electric vehicle (EV) charging, and feasibility studies.

The awards were made this spring and summer, and many awardees now have their projects under contract. The funding aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while delivering meaningful benefits to tribes, overburdened communities and vulnerable populations in Washington. They were funded by the Climate Commitment Act (CCA).

“As the Trump Administration steps back from our clean energy economy, we’re stepping up,” said Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson. “Washington will continue to be a leader in making investments in the future. We’re supporting clean energy, good-paying jobs and community resiliency.”

By reducing their carbon emissions, awardees may also be able to invest more resources in the communities they serve. That’s the hope for the Latino Educational Training Institute, which received $50,000 for a solar and battery storage feasibility study at its community center in Everett during the second round of awards.

“This project will help LETI’s mission to build a sustainable, resilient community hub that supports immigrant wealth-building, job creation, and opportunity in South Everett’s Latino community,” said Marisol Bejarano, LETI’s director of health and wellness programs. “It’s a step toward long-term economic empowerment, environmental sustainability, and a more equitable future for our community.”

It also means cost savings, as is anticipated in the Easton School District in Kittitas County. Easton School District Superintendent Aaron Kombol said the $411,000 awarded for a solar array will save the district an estimated 15-20% on its electrical needs. The savings will let them reinvest in the district’s students.

“We are very excited to have been awarded this grant,” Kombol said. “Not only will the district be able to reduce its ongoing utility bills, but we will also be able to incorporate solar panel system technology into our STEM classes.” The array will allow them to maximize utility cost savings and use those savings to offer more opportunities for students, he said.

Commerce awards CCA funding based on the state’s commitment to helping communities improve their resilience, reduce carbon emissions, and increase equitable access to clean technology. It was administered through Commerce’s Clean Energy Community Grant program. The first round was announced last spring, while the final awards were made in the spring and summer.

“We’re putting this money back into communities who need it,” said Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn. “Our goal is to reduce carbon emissions, and the people who know best how to do that are the people receiving these critical investments.”

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects.
The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain.
Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.","LOS ANGELES -- On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

There have been a lot of headlines and spirited debate around recently passed federal legislation to expire federal tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs).

The good news is that regardless of your stance, even without federal incentives, EVs can save money for state and local government fleets in Arizona.

Recent data released by Arizona PIRG Education Fund, The Nature Conservancy Arizona, and Frontier Group found that Arizona can realize savings of more than $100 million over the next decade – $44 million of that for Arizona state agencies – by replacing retiring light-duty trucks, SUVs and vans in Arizona’s state and local government fleets with comparable EVs.

Consider the following:

State and local governments in Arizona own thousands of vehicles

State and local governments in Arizona own more than 100,000 vehicles, with more than 7,500 in the state fleet alone. Most of Arizona’s fleet vehicles – from sedans to pickup trucks to construction vehicles – are internal combustion engine vehicles that use gasoline or diesel, which are costly to fuel and to maintain.

EV models offer options to get the job done

EVs are more efficient and cheaper to fuel and maintain than traditional vehicles – and are often just as capable. EVs can travel much farther on a charge than those that were available just a few years ago. And there are also more choices than ever before, with more than 100 models of light-duty and larger EVs currently available and on our roads, including pickup trucks and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles such as electric buses, cargo vans, freight trucks and garbage trucks.

EVs improve air and health

In addition to saving money for taxpayers, the recent research found by driving EVs instead of gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles over the next decade, Arizona state and local governments could save more than 1 million barrels of oil; cut emissions of smog-forming nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds by 103,000 pounds and 496,000 pounds, respectively; and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 387,000 tons (carbon dioxide equivalent), the same amount as produced by 81,000 typical cars in a year. Of those reductions, 98,000 tons could come from electrifying the state fleet alone.

Clearly, EVs provide a big opportunity for Arizona to save money for taxpayers and to reduce air pollution. To tap that promise, Arizona governments should follow this roadmap: make bold commitments and stick with them, showing the resolve of the state and local governments to save taxpayers money by electrifying vehicles; develop a detailed fleet electrification plan to set purchasing priorities and guide investments in charging infrastructure; take full advantage of incentives offered by APS, SRP, and TEP, including technical assistance programs that offer an analysis of the current fleet and opportunities and options to transition to EVs; and share expertise and pool resources across state and local governments.

While Arizonans do not agree on everything, the vast majority of us can agree that spending our tax dollars more wisely and in a manner that contributes to improved air quality and public health is a worthwhile endeavor.",https://arizonadigitalfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Diane-Brown.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 14:04:14.840720

DTE Energy, a major player in the U.S. energy sector, faces mounting legal and environmental risks as its subsidiary, EES Coke Battery, contends with a partial summary judgment ruling from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over Clean Air Act violations. This case is not merely a legal dispute but a microcosm of broader systemic challenges in aligning corporate practices with the demands of a decarbonizing economy.

The EES Coke Battery Case: A Legal and Environmental Flashpoint

According to a report by Planet Detroit, the trial court granted the EPA’s motion for partial summary judgment on August 25, 2025, ruling that EES Coke Battery violated the Clean Air Act by emitting excessive sulfur dioxide and failing to comply with new source review (NSR) requirements [2]. The court also rejected DTE Energy’s argument that it should not be held liable for the actions of its subsidiary, a decision that underscores the growing legal precedent for parent-subsidiary accountability in environmental matters [1].

The environmental implications of these violations are stark. Sulfur dioxide emissions from EES Coke Battery contribute to respiratory illnesses and acid rain, disproportionately affecting nearby communities [2]. The EPA’s trial brief, which includes requests for civil penalties, highlights the agency’s renewed focus on enforcing air quality standards amid a regulatory landscape shaped by the Trump administration’s deregulatory agenda [1].

Regulatory Risk in the Energy Transition Era

The EES Coke Battery case must be understood within the context of shifting regulatory priorities. Since 2020, the EPA has oscillated between enforcement and leniency. A 2025 study by Environmental Data Governance notes that the agency’s enforcement efforts declined sharply during the pandemic, with 40% fewer emissions tests conducted in early 2020 compared to 2019 [1]. However, recent actions—such as the EPA’s repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule and its push for stricter greenhouse gas standards—signal a return to proactive regulation [3].

This regulatory ambiguity creates significant uncertainty for energy companies. For instance, the SEC’s climate-related disclosure rules, though temporarily stayed, compel firms to consider how climate risks affect their financial performance [2]. Parent companies like DTE Energy must now navigate overlapping frameworks, including the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the upcoming Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which mandate supply chain transparency and climate transition plans [1]. These requirements extend liability beyond a company’s direct operations, forcing firms to scrutinize subsidiaries for compliance with increasingly stringent standards.

The Financial and Reputational Stakes

DTE Energy’s inability to predict the financial implications of the EES Coke Battery case reflects the broader volatility of corporate liability in the energy transition. A trial for remedies, including potential penalties, is scheduled for September 15, 2025, with DTE planning to appeal the court’s decision [1]. Even if the company succeeds in overturning the ruling, the reputational damage from prolonged litigation could erode investor confidence.

The financial risks are compounded by the EPA’s enforcement patterns. Research from ScienceDirect indicates that EPA actions can indirectly drive corporate green innovation, as firms seek to avoid penalties by adopting cleaner technologies [1]. For DTE, this means either investing in costly retrofits for EES Coke Battery or facing escalating fines and operational restrictions. Either path could strain profitability, particularly as the energy sector shifts toward renewables.

A Broader Trend: Parent-Subsidiary Liability and Global Standards

The EES Coke Battery case also illustrates a global trend toward stricter parent-subsidiary liability. The CSRD and CSDDD, for example, require companies to assess environmental and human rights risks across their entire value chains, including subsidiaries [1]. This aligns with the court’s rejection of DTE’s argument that it is not responsible for EES Coke’s actions. Such rulings are likely to become more common as regulators and courts recognize the systemic risks posed by opaque corporate hierarchies.

Meanwhile, the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Inventory of U.S. Emissions provide granular data on corporate pollution, enabling more precise enforcement [2]. For investors, this transparency is a double-edged sword: it reduces information asymmetry but also increases the likelihood of penalties for non-compliance.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

The EES Coke Battery case is a harbinger of the challenges facing energy companies in the 21st century. As regulatory frameworks evolve to address climate change and social equity, firms must balance short-term compliance costs with long-term sustainability. For DTE Energy, the path forward will require not only legal strategy but also a recommitment to environmental stewardship. Investors, in turn, must weigh the financial risks of litigation and penalties against the reputational and operational costs of inaction.

New England needs homegrown offshore wind energy to keep the lights on and our electricity affordable.""","Critics over the weekend heaped scorn on the US Department of Energy after it made demonstrably false claims about renewable energy.

In a post on X late last week, the Department of Energy (DOE) argued that ""wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and the wind is not blowing,"" even though batteries allow the storage of energy from both sources that can be used long after its initial generation.

The post drew immediate ridicule from social media users who expressed astonishment that the people running America's energy policy seem to be woefully ignorant about renewable energy storage.

""We are governed by some of the dumbest people in the history of this country, proudly, unashamedly, openly moronic and ignorant, and I am genuinely not sure how the US ever recovers from this,"" commented Zeteo editor-in-chief Medhi Hassan. ""These people make George W. Bush and Sarah Palin look like savants.""

The press office for California Gov. Gavin Newsom sarcastically tried to educate the president's team about how energy storage works.

""We're excited for the Trump administration to learn about BATTERIES (we have them here in California, and they've helped the Golden State shift to green, clean energy AND keep the lights on),"" they wrote.

Alex Stapp, the cofounder of the Institute for Progress, also touted California's embrace of renewable energy, and he pointed out that batteries on a given day provide more than a quarter of all energy in the state at peak hours.

Fossil fuel industry watchdog Oil PAC Tracker argued that this kind of ignorant rhetoric about renewable energy was part of a pattern from US Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who is the former CEO of onshore oilfield services company Liberty Energy.

""Secretary Wright should be fired for lying to American people,"" they wrote. ""He profits off this kind of misinformation because he is a fossil fuel executive. Killing clean energy deployment also hurts our economy, makes electricity expensive and increases our power sector emissions.""

Meteorologist Matthew Cappucci also leveled the administration for pushing misinformation about renewable energy.

""The fact that such an obviously false and, frankly, asinine tweet was just issued by a federal government account is an insult to the American people,"" he argued. ""Renewables could make up the majority of our energy in a multi-layered system with better energy storage if we actually tried.""

The DOE's post came at a time when the Trump administration is shutting down wind and solar power projects across the country and when American's energy bills are rising due in part to increased demands being placed on the electric grid by artificial intelligence data centers.

A report released earlier this month by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis declared that Trump's energy agenda ""will fail... unless the White House stops issuing stop-work orders for offshore wind.""

The report further added that ""renewable energy and dispatchable storage are the only option for adding significant amounts of new generation capacity to the US grid for at least the next five years,"" while also detailing that there are simply no short-term alternatives for rapidly building up capacity.

Susan Muller, a senior energy analyst, similarly took aim late last month at the administration's order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project off the coast of New England, which she argued would have provided fast relief to people in the region struggling to pay their utility bills.

""This stop-work order from the Trump administration is a lose-lose for pretty much everyone except fossil gas corporations,"" she said. ""Stopping the project could not only cost thousands of jobs and ratepayers real money but have life or death consequences if we lose power in the middle of a cold snap.

According to the company, the recycling facility will be part of a $1.68 billion advanced fuel center and will reprocess spent fuel into fresh fuel for fast reactors like Oklo’s Aurora Powerhouse, which the company plans to build at Idaho National Laboratory.

Second, Washington, D.C.-based Curio announced the completion of laboratory-scale demonstrations of its NuCycle voloxidation processing technology. The testing was done in collaboration with Idaho, Oak Ridge , Pacific Northwest , and Sandia National Laboratories with support from the Department of Energy’s ARPA-E CURIE program and GAIN voucher initiative.

Oklo expects to begin producing metal fuel for Aurora Powerhouses by the early 2030s, following regulatory review and approvals. Curio, meanwhile, is targeting a demonstration of its pilot-scale NuCycle modules by the fourth quarter of 2027.

Oklo details: According to Oklo, the recycling facility will recover usable fuel material from spent nuclear fuel and fabricate it into fuel for advanced reactors. The facility, which will reprocess spent fuel by electrorefining-based pyroprocessing, is the first phase of the company’s broader advanced fuel center, a multifacility campus aimed at supporting recycling and fuel fabrication.

Oklo has completed a licensing project plan for the recycling facility with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is currently in pre-application engagement with NRC staff. In July, Oklo successfully completed pre-application readiness assessment for Phase 1 of the combined license application for its first commercial Aurora Powerhouse.

The company also said it is also exploring opportunities with the Tennessee Valley Authority to recycle the utility’s spent fuel at the new facility and to evaluate potential power sales from future Oklo powerhouses in the region to TVA. According to Oklo, the collaboration would mark the first time a U.S. utility has explored recycling its used fuel using modern electrochemical processes.

Curio details: According to Curio, NuCycle is the first nuclear fuel recycling technology designed from the ground up with safeguards and proliferation-hardening integrated into its process to be tested and validated at the lab scale.

At ORNL, Curio demonstrated its voloxidation techniques, which the company said offer unprecedented efficiency and scalability in decladding spent fuel. During testing, more than 99.75 percent of the fuel was released from its zircaloy cladding, according to Curio. Under the DOE’s GAIN voucher program, ORNL completed criticality safety assessments of Curio’s next-generation equipment designs with no safety constraints identified, the company added.

The pulverized product from the decladding process was then shipped to PNNL, which validated Curio’s fluorination circuit. The decontamination process yielded enrichment-ready uranium hexafluoride at some of the purest levels ever recorded from a single-stage process, according to the company. Working with PNNL, Curio said it scaled the chemical process from milligram-level experiments to 100 grams, proving both its viability and scalability.

INL, meanwhile, provided Curio data on its electrolysis process for recycling fuel, in which a molten-salt bath was used to separate actinides. By systematically varying temperature and concentration, researchers were able to study the fundamental redox chemistry that will enable co-extraction of plutonium with uranium and minor actinides in a proliferation-hardened manner, the company said.

Data from these lab-scale experiments are now informing Curio’s work with Sandia to develop a comprehensive safeguards and security model. This collaboration will conduct iterative material control and accounting analysis, using the experimental results to create a nuclear fuel recycling process that is safeguarded by design.

Curio intends to complete its lab-scale demonstration with actual spent nuclear fuel at INL and is actively exploring a first pilot with the DOE.

Quotables: “Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo cofounder and CEO. “By recycling used fuel at scale, we are turning waste into gigawatts, reducing costs, and establishing a secure U.S. supply chain that will support the deployment of clean, reliable, and affordable power.”

Curio CEO Ed McGinnis noted, “We are moving at a pace the industry has never seen to deliver a fundamentally new, safeguarded-by-design platform that will redefine the economics and security of the entire nuclear fuel cycle. These unprecedented results demonstrate the strength of public–private collaboration in advancing sustainable nuclear solutions.”",https://www.ans.org/file/21524/l/Fuel_Recycling_Render_PR.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 17:05:42.640522

Hitachi Energy said the planned investments are aligned with the Trump administration’s AI action plan.","Dive Brief:

Hitachi Energy will build a $457 million transformer production facility in South Boston, Virginia, and make more than $500 million in other investments to meet the growing need for U.S. grid equipment, the company, state officials and the Trump administration announced Thursday.

The investment comes as lead times for utilities to procure transformers have stretched from weeks to years, as grid expansion and a shortage of manufacturing capacity have created a bottleneck. In particular, large transformers like the ones Hitachi will make in Virginia can now take up to three years from order to delivery, experts say.

“Bringing production of large power transformers to the U.S. is critical to building a strong domestic supply chain for the U.S. economy and reducing production bottlenecks, which is essential as demand for these transformers across the economy is surging,” Andreas Schierenbeck, CEO of Hitachi Energy, said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

“Power transformers are a linchpin technology for a robust and reliable electric grid and winning the AI race,” Schierenbeck said.

The U.S. grid now faces rapid load increases following decades of stagnant growth. Data centers could be the source of 44% of U.S. electricity load growth from 2023 to 2028, Bain & Co. estimated in October. They could potentially consume 9% of domestic electricity generation by 2030 — double the amount consumed today, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

Electrification of transportation and buildings, and an industrial expansion, are also creating demand for electricity and a need to expand the power grid.

“Particularly at this critical moment for our growing energy demands, I’m excited to see Hitachi Energy expand their Virginia footprint,” Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a statement.

The company already owns a transformer production facility in South Boston. And in March, it announced a $250 million investment to expand global production of critical components for electrical transformers, including enhancing production capacity at the company’s factories in Virginia, Missouri, and Mississippi.

Construction on the new facility will begin before the end of this year, and it “should be operational by 2028. We won’t be at full production right away, but will ramp up fairly quickly,” Kurt Steinert, Hitachi head of external communications, North America, said in an email.

The details of the Virginia production capacity expansion are commercially sensitive and cannot be disclosed, he said. But other projects in the $1 billion investment include:

$106 million for the company’s transformer components facility in Alamo, Tennessee.

$22.5 million for a capacity expansion at Hitachi Energy’s dry-type transformer factory in Bland, Virginia, and a new supporting facility in Atkins, Virginia.

$70 million for the expansion of high-voltage components production facilities in and around Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania.

And other projects that Hitachi expects to announce later this year.

Extended timelines to procure grid equipment have led to delays in connecting new demand. The President’s National Infrastructure Advisory Council last year recommended the federal government should establish a “strategic virtual reserve” of electric transformers to ensure challenges surrounding U.S. manufacturing of the critical grid components do not slow electrification efforts.

Hitachi Energy said the planned investments are aligned with the Trump administration’s AI action plan. “The United States must develop a comprehensive strategy to enhance and expand the power grid,” that plan concluded.

“If we are going to win the AI race, reindustrialize, and keep the lights on, America is going to need a lot more reliable energy,” Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement. He praised Hitachi’s investment and said the Trump administration “looks forward to continuing to partner with private industry to ensure the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy and thousands of high-paying jobs.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Qw0YPanqFpyt_nHG0dNYhh82jnC7XmudqIJOqQdsuks/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9oaXRhY2hpLWVuZXJneS1zb3V0aC1ib3N0b24tZmFjdG9yeS0yMDI1LmpwZWc=.webp,N,,2025-09-08 14:05:40.928377

Following a significant leadership change in early 2025, the company replaced top production staff including CEO and COO, implementing urgent operational improvements that dramatically enhanced recovery efficiency.

Secured $115 million through convertible notes at 5.5% coupon rate, attracting institutional investors including funds managing $10-30 billion, with approximately 45% from long-term oriented funds rather than typical hedge fund converts.

Maintains America's only two operational ISR plants while developing South Dakota project (Fast-41 designated) and exploring approximately 20 advanced exploration projects across the US, positioning for industry consolidation opportunities.

William Sheriff, Executive Chairman of enCore Energy, embodies the urgency driving America's leading in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium producer through a period of operational transformation and strategic expansion. With uranium demand surging globally and supply constraints tightening, enCore's position as one of the few actual producers has become increasingly valuable in a market where execution trumps promises.

The company's journey through 2025 illustrates both the challenges and opportunities facing uranium producers in an environment where regulatory complexity, talent shortages, and capital requirements create significant barriers to entry while rewarding those who can deliver consistent production.

Operational Excellence Through Crisis Management

enCore's transformation began with a management crisis that could have derailed the company but instead became a catalyst for operational excellence. In early 2025, the company made difficult but necessary leadership changes, removing the CEO, COO, and lead plant manager due to concerns about operational urgency.

Sheriff explained that while former CEO Paul Goranson was instrumental in building the plants and achieving initial production, the company needed different leadership for the next phase of growth.

The results of this management overhaul have been dramatic. The company reduced average well completion times from over seven days to just 1.3 days, a metric Sheriff considers ""rather profound"" because it directly correlates to production capacity. This improvement came through internal promotions rather than external hiring, demonstrating the strength of enCore's existing talent bench.

""Our production rate on a daily basis has gone, depending on what time frame you're measuring it against, from up 200% to up 300%.""

The Drilling Revolution

Central to enCore's production surge is an aggressive drilling program that has expanded from 12-14 rigs to 29 currently operating, with plans to reach 32 by October 2025. This expansion reflects both the rapid recovery characteristics of South Texas uranium deposits and the company's newfound operational discipline.

""In order to up your production you've got to get more wells in the ground, right? More wells, more fluid flow, more uranium going through the plant, higher recovery, higher daily production rate.""

The company has also become more selective with drilling contractors, purchasing several rigs on lease-back arrangements while maintaining the flexibility to dismiss underperforming contractors.

This operational discipline extends to understanding decline curves, or what Sheriff prefers to call ""recovery curves."" The rapid recovery characteristics of ISR operations accelerate cash flow but require constant drilling ahead of production to maintain output levels.

Strategic Financing and Institutional Validation

Perhaps the most significant development for enCore has been its successful $115 million convertible note financing, completed at terms rarely seen in the uranium sector. The 5.5% coupon rate on unsecured notes represents ""financing that we've not seen before,"" according to Sheriff, who compared it favourably to federal government rates.

The financing structure attracted an entirely new class of institutional investors to enCore's shareholder base. During more than 20 discussions with major institutions, Sheriff engaged with funds managing $10-30 billion, with one fund exceeding $100 billion in AUM.

""Roughly 40, 45, 50% of ours were done with long holds,"" Sheriff noted, contrasting this with typical convertible note structures dominated by hedge funds that immediately short the underlying stock. The proof came in market behaviour, with only 12% short interest compared to the typical 20-25% seen with hedge fund-dominated convertibles.

This institutional validation opens doors beyond immediate capital needs. ""It introduced us to an entirely new level of investor,"" Sheriff emphasized, describing how the financing created relationships with generalist funds that represent ""the biggest box of cash out there.""

Interview with William M. Sheriff, Executive Chairman, enCore Energy

Resource Base Expansion

enCore's acquisition strategy focuses on extending the productive life of existing operations while building a pipeline for future growth. The company recently completed acquisition of the Tacubaya project, immediately adjacent and down-dip from the flagship Alta Mesa operation.

""Over 200 property owners. It's taken over two years to get them all lined up. It’s very difficult to get consensus among three people, much less 200.""

The Tacubaya acquisition provides critical geological continuity, as Sheriff explained: ""Mother nature doesn't have north south straight lines or any other direction straight lines. So clearly it was a property boundary,"" referring to how their resource maps had previously terminated at artificial property boundaries rather than geological boundaries.

Equally important is the company's enhanced data analysis of existing resources. With thousands of drill holes at Alta Mesa, enCore has identified new productive trends by analyzing data on a more granular basis, looking at specific geological horizons rather than broad ore zones.

""We've taken each sandstone separately and looked at what are the cutoff grades, and we're seeing new trends emerge within that giant body of data.""

This approach has already yielded ""wellfield 3 extension"" and identified three additional areas with potential for development.

Fast-Track Permitting and Development Pipeline

enCore's South Dakota project received Fast-41 designation from the federal government, a significant milestone that provides timeline certainty while imposing performance obligations on the company.

""It gives you a much more certain and much more acceptable timeline to get through all of your filing. It puts a burden on the company to meet their timelines because it's completely transparent.""

This designation reflects the company's established track record with regulators.

""We're established. We have a track record and that gives them some certainty of counterparty reliability.""

The development pipeline extends beyond individual projects to a broader acquisition strategy. enCore has identified approximately 20 exploration and advanced projects in the US, budgeting to successfully acquire four or five of these properties.

The Investment Thesis for enCore Energy

Operational Leadership: Proven ability to rapidly scale uranium production through operational excellence, demonstrated by 200-300% production increases following management changes and systematic drilling optimization

Institutional Validation: Successfully attracted $115 million from top-tier institutional investors at favorable terms (5.5% convertible notes), validating business model and providing capital for strategic growth

Resource Expansion: Strategic acquisitions like Tacubaya extend productive life while enhanced data analysis unlocks additional value from existing assets, creating multiple avenues for organic growth

Regulatory Advantages: Established track record with regulators provides Fast-41 designation benefits and permitting certainty that competitors lack, reducing execution risk for future projects

Consolidation Catalyst: As one of few actual uranium producers, enCore is positioned to lead industry consolidation while benefiting from supply scarcity that penalizes failed execution by competitors

Market Timing: Operating leverage to uranium prices through existing production while maintaining delivery flexibility and avoiding the forward-sale risks that plague development-stage competitors

The uranium market is experiencing a fundamental shift from speculative development stories to operational execution, creating significant value differentiation between producers and project companies. enCore Energy represents the beneficiary of this transition, with institutional capital increasingly recognizing that uranium production requires specialized expertise, regulatory relationships, and operational discipline that few companies possess.

The company's rapid production scaling demonstrates the inherent leverage available to successful ISR operators, where improvements in drilling efficiency and well field management translate directly into production increases and cash flow acceleration. This operational leverage, combined with the company's expanding resource base and institutional backing, positions enCore to capitalize on uranium market fundamentals while maintaining the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions.

With uranium demand surging globally and few new producers successfully reaching commercial production, enCore's established operations and growth pipeline provide sustained competitive advantages in an increasingly supply-constrained market.

TL;DR

enCore Energy has transformed from operational crisis to production leadership through management changes and drilling optimization, achieving 200-300% production increases while securing $115 million in institutional financing at favorable terms. The company's proven ISR operations, expanding resource base, and strategic acquisition pipeline position it as a consolidation catalyst in a supply-constrained uranium market where execution capabilities create sustainable competitive advantages over development-stage competitors.

Dive Brief:

Sodium-ion battery manufacturer Natron Energy has ceased operations, according to its website, halting plans for a giant factory in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

The Santa Clara, California-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment about what happened. The Raleigh News & Observer reported that Natron had unresolved funding issues, and investor Sherwood Partners is expected to sell the assets.

This comes about a year after the battery maker said it would build a gigafactory in northeastern North Carolina with an investment of $1.4 billion, creating more than 1,000 jobs for the area.

Dive Insight:

Beyond the company’s plans for North Carolina, Natron operated two U.S. battery facilities. In a letter dated Aug. 28, the company informed Michigan officials that it would permanently close its facilities in Holland, Michigan, and Santa Clara, California, on Sept. 3, affecting 95 employees across both states.

Prior to the closure, Natron was seeking out capital from new and existing investors, as well as new purchase orders that would have resulted in future revenue, the company said in its letter. However, on Aug. 27, its board of directors determined Natron’s efforts were unsuccessful, sparking the layoffs and ultimate shuttering of the company.

Established in 2012, Natron designed its batteries for a range of customers in the industrial power space, including for data centers, electric vehicle charging, telecommunications and more.

Unlike competing batteries made of lithium-acid or lithium-ion, Natron’s sodium-ion batteries did not require expensive materials such as lithium, cobalt or nickel, according to Natron’s website.They also had a stronger battery life due to its Prussian blue electrode structure, the company said.

The 1.2 million-square-foot plant would have produced 14 gigawatts of sodium-ion batteries in North Carolina, expanding Natron’s production 40 times over. The Michigan location began operations in April 2024.

Typically, companies provide a 60-day notice prior to plant closures. Following this rule would have required Natron to disrupt operations and harm its chances of securing funding from investors and customers, the company said in its letter. Sherwood Partners did not immediately respond to request for comment.

“Accordingly, Natron is providing this notice…as soon as practicable,” wrote Elizabeth Shober, Natron’s head of team and talent.

The closure is the latest among companies looking to manufacture batteries outside of Asia. In June, Oregon-based Powin filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and, more recently, sold its assets to FlexGen Power Systems. Sweden-based Northvolt also filed for bankruptcy earlier this year in its home country, citing rising capital costs, geopolitical instability and supply chain disruptions. Several of its assets have since been sold to California-based, lithium-sulfur battery maker Lyten.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/cLVLamIr__p4CSd6zLy1c33yz-o5sxwD3zF5RDw-5Yg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9NR18xNzI0LTk4MHg1OTcuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-08 14:05:54.954905

SPR (SolarPanelRecycling.com) is tripling its solar recycling capacity in North Carolina, adding a 50,000-sq-ft processing plant and a fourth advanced recycling technology to its Salisbury headquarters. The expansion boosts throughput at the site from 500,000 to 1.5 million panels per year, on top of another 1 million panel capacity already in operation at facilities in Texas and Georgia.

The announcement comes as demand for utility-scale decommissioning rises and states such as North Carolina prepare to enforce new recycling mandates. Beginning November 1, 2025, projects over 2 MW in the state must submit decommissioning plans, secure financial assurances for recycling, and meet environmental recovery standards. SPR says its expanded campus and in-house compliance team are designed to give asset owners both the scale and regulatory expertise to meet these obligations.

Fourth technology enhances purity of recovered materials

This latest investment includes the introduction of thermal separation processing, SPR’s fourth distinct recycling method. Earlier this year, the company became the first in the nation to bring bifacial panel recycling to utility scale, complementing two other separation techniques already in use. By combining multiple approaches, SPR says it can maximize recovery rates and deliver higher-quality commodity outputs across a wide variety of panel types.

“We are not storing panels or output for future ideas,” said Brett C. Henderson, CEO of SPR. “Our customers know that we are recycling at scale right now, with verifiable consumers of our clean outputs.”

Industry support for scale and compliance

Utility-scale decommissioning firms welcomed the move. “Our asset owners are facing increasing obligations to responsibly manage end-of-life panels,” said Justin Wright, executive vice president of RCI Energy Services. “SPR’s advanced recycling technology and increased capacity give us confidence that we can meet these requirements cost-effectively while supporting the broader shift to a cleaner, more resilient grid.”

SPR currently operates the largest distributed network of owned and operated solar recycling plants in the U.S., with additional sites planned for 2026. The company emphasizes that scaling its geographic footprint also cuts transportation costs and emissions—two often-overlooked factors in the lifecycle of utility-scale solar projects.

“We saw an opportunity with the advent of the business courts to marry them with an innovation of our Texas corporate code,” Converse says.
But if SB29 delivers on its promise, what could that mean for Texas’ securities law industry?
Proponents envision a future where attorneys and law schools nationwide become as well-versed in Texas business law as they are today in Delaware’s.
In the meantime, firms are ramping up their securities practices, with some devoting entire teams to Texas corporate governance.","In Ernest Hemingway’s debut novel, The Sun Also Rises, one character asks another how he went bankrupt. The man answers: “Two ways…Gradually and then suddenly.” The authors of a new Texas law hope they’ve engineered a similar progression for the state’s business supremacy. Senate Bill 29, passed earlier this year, aims to leverage Texas’ economic and judicial infrastructure to create an unparalleled business environment—one that appears to be accelerating slowly at first, and then all at once.

The state has long fostered an environment ideal for entrepreneurs and corporations, thanks to its low cost of living, relaxed regulatory climate, growing population, and a mindset that balances independence with hospitality. Now, lawmakers are providing additional legal consistency for companies incorporated in Texas. The new law builds on other recent developments—such as the creation of a local stock exchange and a business court system.

In the closing weeks of the 2025 legislative session, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed SB29, codifying a business judgment rule that protects directors from liability for decisions made in good faith. The bill also allows Texas companies to set trial venues and waive jury trials for internal entity claims, ensuring experienced judges rule on complex business matters. In essence, it protects boards and corporations from unmerited shareholder lawsuits following significant decisions, like mergers or acquisitions, and offers a consistent legal framework businesses can rely on.

Chris Babcock and Chris Converse, Dallas-based securities law partners at Foley & Lardner, helped write the legislation and shepherd it through the Capitol. They aren’t regular lobbyists, but they dove into the legislative process when they saw a timely opportunity: the emergence of Texas business courts and growing corporate dissatisfaction with Delaware’s chancery system.

“We saw an opportunity with the advent of the business courts to marry them with an innovation of our Texas corporate code,” Converse says. “To attract companies to incorporate in a jurisdiction, you need a clear set of rules—and a specialized expert or a business court.”

SB29 also raises the threshold for shareholders to challenge decisions made in good faith by a public company’s board. Instead of allowing a single shareholder to file a suit, companies can now require that no less than 3 percent of shareholders must join together to bring a corporate governance claim. The goal: to reduce frivolous litigation and foster a more predictable legal environment.

Corporate concerns about questionable shareholder lawsuits are well-founded. A report analyzing securities suits filed between 2018 and 2020 found that a single individual ranked second—after the SEC—in total lawsuits brought. During that period, Shiva Stein filed 124 securities claims, more than even the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal agency tasked with regulating financial markets. These are not class actions but individual suits, often alleging inaccurate disclosures after mergers. The new law aims to shield companies from repeat lawsuits brought by so-called rogue shareholders working with law firms that may be more focused on quick payouts than governance concerns.

“Corporate decision-making should be controlled by shareholders and their elected boards—not by third-party activists who hijack the mechanisms of corporate governance for their own enrichment,” Babcock says.

The hope is that this will lead to what some are calling “Dexit”: a migration of incorporations from Delaware to Texas. The legislation seeks to capitalize on inconsistent Delaware chancery court rulings and the launch of Texas business courts to encourage companies to rethink where they incorporate—or to consider Texas when going public. Supporters also believe the law will boost relocations and stimulate broader economic growth.

“If a board acts in good faith and uses its best judgment to make a decision, that shouldn’t be scrutinized—unless there’s clear misconduct,” says Brad Foster, a securities partner at Haynes Boone. “We’ve got great companies and great boards, and they have a right to exercise their judgment without fear of constant second-guessing. That’s not the way to run a company.”

Delaware isn’t conceding easily. In March, its legislature passed a law limiting average stockholders’ rights and protecting controlling shareholders and directors from certain liabilities.

Time will tell if Delaware’s reforms are enough to stem an exodus. But if SB29 delivers on its promise, what could that mean for Texas’ securities law industry? Proponents envision a future where attorneys and law schools nationwide become as well-versed in Texas business law as they are today in Delaware’s. Currently, any serious corporate firm or law school course catalog includes Delaware law. SB29 could put Texas on that same footing.

In the meantime, firms are ramping up their securities practices, with some devoting entire teams to Texas corporate governance. The business community hopes that incorporations and relocations will grow gradually—then suddenly.

“There’s already a broad base of lawyers familiar with both Texas and Delaware law, and we’re here and open for business to assist companies,” says Matt Fry, Dallas-based co-chair of Haynes Boone’s capital markets and securities practice. “But the real goal is to get companies to move their operations, personnel, and headquarters to the state of Texas.”",https://assets.dmagstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/capitol-building-senate.webp,N,,2025-09-08 13:10:04.361944

It’s a large brown and tan shorebird with long legs and a curved beak it uses to dig into the sand and mud for food.

And there are wind turbines—176 of them to be exact—being built about 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach to produce 2.6 gigawatts of electricity.

As the whimbrel flies south for the winter, and humanity seeks the clean energy that could stave off the worst consequences of climate change, researchers in Virginia are seeking to answer a question: Can the whimbrel and turbines in its flight path coexist peacefully?

“We need to know a lot more about how the birds are moving out over that open water,” said Alex Wilke, a coastal scientist with The Nature Conservancy. “How might this additional infrastructure—these offshore wind energy projects—impact them?”

The Nature Conservancy, Dominion Energy and the William and Mary Center for Conservation Biology are working to answer the question by studying the whimbrel’s interaction or avoidance with the utility’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project, expected to be the largest offshore wind project in the country once it comes online in 2026.

The conservation group has used funding from Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility, for research that found about 42 percent of all whimbrel will fly over the wind energy area designated for the utility’s offshore wind project, and a smaller one further south, off the coast of North Carolina. The new research is finding that, on their north and southbound journeys, a handful of the 31 tracked birds have come into contact with the area within the turbines’ spinning blades.

“Anytime you put a hazard in the airspace that birds use, there’s a chance that birds will fly into it. We see that all the time,” said Bryan Watts, director of the Center for Conservation Biology. “They fly into transmission lines, they fly into towers. Yes, there’s a chance that birds have hit (the turbines).”

The goal of the research is to attain more specific data on the whimbrel’s flight patterns that will help guide policy decisions around future offshore wind projects. Environmental and ratepayer groups see the project as a way to provide massive amounts of electricity cheaply, even as President Donald Trump has moved to block offshore wind projects in Rhode Island and Maryland.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has instructed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to review how wind projects may be harming the bald eagle. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs have also already increased the CVOW project’s initial $9.8 billion cost by $500 million, and could further increase costs to $11.2 billion-to-$11.3 billion through 2026 if the duties remain.

Despite those challenges, Dominion is continuing with the project, which is intended to satisfy a requirement under the Virginia Clean Economy Act, the state’s decarbonization law, and researchers haven’t recorded any whimbrel deaths thus far.

“Offshore is a lot different than onshore,” said Matt Overton, a biological consultant at Dominion. “It’s really still developing.”

The Whimbrel

The whimbrel is among hundreds of millions of birds, from 200 different species, that travel down the Western Atlantic Flyway as part of a migration to the top of the Amazon rainforest in South America. The journey begins at their summer home in the subarctic and arctic regions of Canada and northeastern Alaska.

A member of the curlew family, the whimbrel will stop on the Delmarva Peninsula as it makes its way south. Many congregate on the southern portions of the peninsula, on the eastern shore of Virginia, in the early fall and again in the spring when they fly back north for summer.

“They’re using our marshes for roosting. Sometimes they’re on the beaches,” said Wilke. “They’re using this kind of mosaic of different habitats out in the system.”

With their elongated and curved beak, the Whimbrel will burrow into marshes and mud flats along shorelines for fiddler crab feedings. The bird will increase their body mass by 50 percent over their period of recharging, Watts said.

“They’re in the air for five or six days without stopping,” said Watts. “The Delmarva Bay is a critical staging area for them.”

The reliance on the land for their livelihood, which is considered to be at a tipping point, emphasizes the importance of maintaining the ecosystem, particularly in the face of climate change, Wilke explained. The Eastern Shore’s barrier islands, including Paramore Island, serve to weaken the Atlantic Ocean’s tide strengths before it reaches the shore and causes erosion and flooding.

Between the island and the shore are the swaths of marshland that are intertwined with channels that feed the grasses where the whimbrel feed. While the Nature Conservancy has some land into conservation areas to maintain the area’s ecological features, sea level rise is expected to turn about 3,800 acres of beach and dune features and barrier islands into open water by 2080, according to Virginia’s Coastal Resilience Master Plan.

The whimbrel needs protected undisturbed areas, clean water, good prey and good food sources, Wilke said. “If any one thing breaks down or goes away or is really negatively impacted at any one of those points, it can really impact the survival of that species and that bird,” he said. “These staging areas are just so important.”

The Wind Turbines

In a somewhat awkward irony, the whimbrel could benefit from CVOW’s emissions reductions over the long haul but could face more immediate harms from the turbines.

Government officials had studied the CVOW’s 112,000-acre wind energy area before identifying it as available in 2012. An analysis by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ultimately found that the areas “would not adversely affect” birds listed under the Endangered Species Act, including the Roseate Tern and the Piping Plover. A further analysis found that another endangered species, the Bermuda petrel or cahow, “may seasonally occur in the vicinity of the Virginia” wind energy area.

Wilke lauded that the area had been chosen as the site for Dominion’s offshore wind project, in part because of its distance from the shore, away from many birds that fly closer to the coast. If built about 50 miles further east, the turbines would have had to float, which is more costly than driving the monopiles about 100 feet deep and then another 100 feet into the sea floor.

“Dominion has acted as a responsible actor in placing the turbine field where they have. They considered all of the available information on how to minimize bird impacts,” said Watts. “Whenever you place these things, you’re always making some type of compromise. I think they made the best compromises that they could in siting the location.”

Even though “the lease site was set years ago,” Watts said, “that doesn’t mean there aren’t things to be learned so that site placements can be improved … in the future.”

Watts and Wilke had been studying the whimbrel for years, in part because the species uses the Western Atlantic Flyway for both their spring and fall migrations. They are good to track because they’re also big enough to carry trackers, which at first were connected via satellite. Now, the birds are tracked using cell service that is able to monitor their flight patterns more frequently.

“It’s really quite amazing that you can do that and then sit back at your computer and basically watch where these birds are going and what they’re doing,” said Wilke.

To apply the tags, the researchers used fishing line to make carpet like nets with loops and place them on mudflats the whimbrels frequent. When one stepped into the loop, it became trapped and the researchers emerged from their hidden marsh covering to grab the bird.

“You zip over there because sometimes they can get free. And then you tag them and then let them go,” said Wilke. “Or, in some places, it depends on where we are, they can be really sensitive to the heat. We would actually take them to the boat ramp, which was pretty close, and we’d process them in an air conditioned vehicle to help them not overheat.”

While many of the birds are not flying over the wind energy area, instead staying closer to the shore, another update to the technology now being used is crucial for a measurement, which is called tracking the altitude, or flight height.

That flight height is used to determine if the whimbrels are flying within what is called the rotor swept zone, which begins at a center point about 482 feet above the average sea level mark. The zone is what is included within the area the blades rotate around, each of which has a 782-foot diameter.

Of the tagged birds, the percentage of whimbrels expected to be exposed to the windfarm’s swept zone on southbound flights is 6.8 percent. For the northbound trips in the spring, research indicates 4.7 percent of whimbrels would be exposed to the windfarm’s sweptzone.

Overton said the turbines have cameras and he was pleasantly “not surprised” that there hadn’t been observed deaths, though Watts acknowledged there may have been deaths among birds that weren’t tracked.

What’s next is to understand the population of birds using the staging area and how much of a risk comes from placing a certain wind farm in a certain location. If a certain amount of the bird population could be lost, that could inform how much compensation or mitigation needs to occur to make up for potential damages, Watts said.

Other measures, like painting the turbines a dark color, could make them stand out, though their whitish color is chosen to make them less visible to beachgoers. The turbines are already equipped with blinking lights for aircraft that may be flying in the area.

When the project is complete and all 176 turbines are lined up next to each other, they could act as more of a visual deterrent.

“We’re going to be in a pause period here for a while, but in the long term, these green energies are going to move forward,” said Watts. “They make the most sense for the planet. Ultimately, I think they’ll make the most sense economically.”

Once various offshore wind projects are up and running, it’s worth continuing the research, Wilke said, to see how any altered flight patterns might affect birds by causing them to expend more energy to fly around the turbines, or not.

“We’ve got these tagged birds in the system that are still collecting data, and they were out there before this project was built, during the project, and hopefully after,” said Wilke. “With the young ones, it’s possible that we could have the chance to see some of the same birds after the project is fully operational, which would be phenomenal.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CVOW-Offshore-Wind-Turbines-Edits-4-27-21-180-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 13:08:59.013434

Growing opposition in rural Louisiana has included attempts to pass parish-wide moratoriums on carbon capture and demands that residents or local governments be allowed to vote on whether to allow the technology, among other grassroots initiatives.

Those are ""a direct result"" of a lack of communication from companies, said Dustin Davidson, the new secretary of Louisiana's energy and natural resources agency.

""I can tell you that a lot of the moratoriums we're seeing from different parishes is a direct result of not knowing who these operators are and not knowing who the people are who are coming in and setting up their seismic surveys or their drilling rigs, not knowing what's going on,"" Davidson said on the final day of a three-day industry conference on carbon capture at LSU on Friday.

""There has to be direct communication with the parish,"" he said.

Davidson, whose agency is the state's chief regulator of carbon capture projects, added that residents and leaders in rural Louisiana need to be able to put ""a face to a name"" and have someone to whom they can ask questions.

He added that the opposition is an indication that ""we have a public engagement problem that we really need to address.""

Industry and state economic policy officials as well as scientists in LSU's geology and petroleum engineering disciplines see carbon capture as one of the most readily available ways to decarbonize Louisiana's major industries, which have intensive greenhouse gas emissions.

They argue the technology remains safe, well suited to the state's geology and keeps Louisiana industries competitive in a decarbonizing global market.

'A key strategy'

Greg Upton, executive director of the LSU Center for Energy Studies, explained at the conference that demand for low carbon energy sources and production methods, like carbon capture, was being driven by the increased use of Louisiana's energy and chemical production for foreign export.

Companies are trying to find ways to reduce the emissions of those products in a cost-competitive way to meet global demand and their own internal goals for low carbon products, regardless of political winds in the United States, Upton added.

""Of course, carbon sequestration is a key strategy that could be used to reduce emissions intensity of products,"" he said.

Davidson said that part of the message local officials need to hear is that carbon dioxide storage brings in businesses looking to make more competitive exports.

But fears about what decades of stored carbon could do to groundwater — critical for drinking water and agriculture in rural Louisiana — and worries over the risk of CO2 pipeline leaks has sparked grassroots opposition in Republican and typically pro-oil-and-gas sectors of the state.

The opposition has spurred continuing legislative and local attempts to block or restrict the technology and become a campaign issue for U.S. Senate candidate and State Treasurer John Fleming.

In 2022, Livingston Parish adopted a moratorium over a proposed carbon capture field under Lake Maurepas and another planned under timberland and country estates near Holden, only to see a court block the law due to the state's authority in permitting the projects.

Early last month, Allen Parish withdrew its own carbon capture permitting regime after ExxonMobil sued in federal court in July, arguing state primacy in permitting trumped the local permitting rules.

Late last month, the Iberia Parish Council considered a moratorium until the parish's attorney warned the law wasn't on its side.

'Cooperation is more critical'

While state officials, university scientists and industry executives participated in the high-level talk about better presenting carbon capture Friday, officials at DENR were grappling with new legislative pushback over a CO2 pipeline project in southwestern Louisiana.

A letter signed by 32 legislators asked DENR on Wednesday to delay a hearing planned Tuesday to decide whether to grant Low Carbon Logistics CCS Transport's pipeline certificates that would have allowed the ExxonMobil subsidiary to expropriate land for the pipeline corridor.

The land takings, which require fair market value payment, are another flashpoint for opponents of carbon capture.

The legislators wrote that new state rules, which would make getting those expropriation rights tougher, were adopted in the most recent session and take effect Oct. 1, less than a month after the now canceled hearing.

This pipeline also wasn't legislatively granted a waiver to the new rules as a project in St. James Parish has been, the letter added. The legislators said the public needs more time to gather information and comment and couldn't do so before the Tuesday hearing.

""We are in a moment where cooperation is more critical than temporary success,"" the letter said. ""Our citizens and our culture are in some places fractured due to the uncertainty brought on by these projects and by the threats to property rights that actions like these might bring about.""

State Rep. Brett Geymann, R-Lake Charles, and state Sen. Valarie Hodges, R-Denham Springs, were the first two names on the list of signatories.

On Friday, DENR issued a statement that the ExxonMobil subsidiary was withdrawing the application and also defended its public notice of the hearing.

The agency statement explained that the now scuttled hearing wasn't to permit the pipeline but would have served as an evidentiary hearing to verify procedural steps, including that the line had end users, and so followed different, more limited public notice requirements.

The line west of Lake Charles would have linked a methanol plant to an existing CO2 line owned by Denbury, another ExxonMobil subsidiary. The line would have carried the plant's CO2 to Texas, both to a permanent storage site and to an enhanced oil recovery field.

An ExxonMobil spokeswoman said the company asked for the cancellation ""to allow more time to review the route with potential stakeholders.""

""We’re following Louisiana’s pipeline approval process, sharing information with relevant parties and engaging landowners transparently.

While drivers may be pleased about the relatively low gas prices, those working in the industry might not.

Gasoline prices in Michigan dropped from a week ago, on average to $3.18 a gallon for regular unleaded, down from $3.30 a gallon. But before rejoicing, consider what might be a kind of gas price dilemma.

This dilemma highlights conflicting goals and challenges that fuel prices raise, as well as different perspectives on energy policy. While drivers may be pleased about the relatively low gas prices, those who work in the industry may not.

Both affect the economy.

Gas prices affect transportation costs, travel and consumer confidence.

And there’s the environmentalist, who is concerned about carbon emissions and sometimes makes the case that, overall, higher gas prices are good for the planet as an incentive for people to seek and use alternative energy sources.

Emissions, they argue, are affecting climate change and producing more extreme weather and all sorts of disasters, like violent hurricanes, ice storms and droughts that cost money.

With West Texas Intermediate, a grade of crude oil, trading at about $63 a barrel, gas prices are still relatively low, 13 cents less a gallon than last week and more than $2 a gallon less than in 2022, when gasoline prices hit an all-time high.

According to AAA, the highest prices on Sept. 7 in Michigan, on average, were in Ann Arbor, $3.27 a gallon; metro Detroit, $3.26; and Benton Harbor, $3.18; the lowest, in Traverse City, $3.04; and Flint and Saginaw, $3.05.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, which also tracks gas prices, noted that Michigan and some other Great Lakes states ""saw significant relief thanks to the restart of BP’s Whiting, Indiana, refinery.""

Severe weather caused a temporary outage.

But, he said, the West Coast may see continued increases due to seasonal refinery maintenance and the shutdown of a refinery in southern California, which will keep the supply tight.

Additionally, he added, OPEC+ — a group of oil-producing nations — announced an increase in oil production starting in October, which could help keep oil prices lower for longer.

At the same time, because of the low oil prices, oil-industry companies have been laying off workers, which, overall, is also not good for the economy.

ConocoPhillips, headquartered in Houston, was one of the latest to announce job cuts. The company this week said it would slice off up to 25% of its global staff, starting before the holidays.

The news came as data showed a spike in job cuts in August nationwide and a worsening economic outlook contradicted Trump’s claim that the economy is the hottest it has been in years.

But the news also could nudge the Fed to lower interest rates.

Global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said job cuts in August were up 39% from July, and up 13% from the same month a year ago. August’s total, the firm said, was the highest for the month since 2020.

ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, in a Sept. 4 meeting with employees, blamed the cuts, in part, on acquisitions, Reuters reported. ConocoPhillips bought Marathon Oil a year ago, and Concho Resources and Permian assets from Shell in 2021.

But Reuters reported more than a dozen oil companies since 2024 are laying off workers, and that the oil industry job reductions undermine the president’s ""promise to increase U.S. oil and gas production and its clout in global markets.""

In February, Chevron said it would cut 15%-20% of its global workforce, and the month before that, it was reported BP would cut more than 5% of its global workforce to reduce costs and boost investor confidence.

The Trump administration has been working to overhaul America’s energy policy, rolling back emissions regulations and relaxing permitting rules, which should help boost the bottom line of fossil fuel companies.

U.S. oil prices averaged closer to $75 a barrel in 2024, and $78 a barrel the year before that.

Tax equity financing operates by allowing developers to partner with investors who can efficiently utilize federal tax credits, often through structures like Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) or partnership flips. This model has been pivotal in utility-scale solar and storage projects, where upfront capital demands are substantial. For instance, the Palmer Solar Project, a 60 MW installation, leveraged a 25-year PPA to secure long-term revenue predictability, while tax equity investors covered over 40% of the project’s costs through ITCs [2]. Such hybrid structures reduce the cost of capital and align public policy goals with private-sector returns.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has further amplified this dynamic. By introducing direct pay provisions, the IRA enables non-tax-paying entities—such as municipalities and non-profits—to monetize tax credits directly with the IRS, bypassing traditional tax equity intermediaries [3]. This shift has expanded the pool of eligible investors and streamlined project timelines. For example, Valley Children’s Healthcare in California deployed a $30 million solar and storage microgrid, with tax credits covering over 40% of the project’s cost, while Boston Medical Center used ITCs to fund a solar facility that provides energy credits to patients facing energy insecurity [2]. These cases underscore how tax equity financing is democratizing access to clean energy infrastructure.

Scalability and Cost Efficiency: Metrics Post-IRA

The IRA’s $370 billion clean energy incentives have catalyzed a surge in deployment. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), solar now accounts for 7% of U.S. electricity generation, up from 0.1% in 2010 [1]. J.P. Morgan’s Tax Oriented Investments (TOI) team has invested $5–6 billion annually in utility-scale solar and storage projects since 2022, with a landmark $680 million deal with Ørsted supporting assets in Texas and Arizona [3]. These investments highlight the scalability enabled by tax equity-PPA hybrids, which have driven an average annual solar deployment growth rate of 28% over the past decade [2].

Cost efficiency has also improved. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar projects has declined due to IRA-driven economies of scale and domestic content incentives. For instance, projects using U.S.-manufactured components or located in energy communities qualify for additional ITC bonuses, enhancing returns [3]. Meanwhile, energy storage costs have fallen by 40% year-on-year in 2024, though U.S. battery energy storage system (BESS) prices remain higher than in China, reflecting ongoing manufacturing challenges [5].

Challenges and the Path Forward

Despite these gains, systemic bottlenecks persist. Interconnection backlogs, labor shortages, and tariffs on Chinese solar materials threaten to slow deployment [3]. Political uncertainties, such as revised definitions of “start construction” for tax credits, also create risk. However, the sector is adapting. Green bonds and public-private partnerships (PPPs) are emerging as complementary tools to diversify funding sources. For example, Virginia’s Clean Energy Innovation Bank and Pennsylvania’s Solar for Schools program leverage state-level grants and loans to supplement federal incentives [5].

Looking ahead, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) could reshape the landscape by reducing ITC and PTC availability, prompting a shift toward green bonds and alternative capital structures [4]. Developers must also prioritize recycling and infrastructure compatibility to address long-term sustainability concerns [2].

Conclusion

Renewable energy tax equity financing is not merely a financial tool but a strategic lever for the U.S. clean energy transition. By innovating capital structures—whether through SPVs, PPAs, or direct pay mechanisms—developers are scaling solar and storage projects at unprecedented speeds while navigating systemic challenges. As the IRA’s incentives mature and new legislative dynamics emerge, the sector’s ability to adapt will determine its long-term success. For investors, the message is clear: Tax equity financing, paired with agile capital structures, remains a cornerstone of scalable, cost-effective clean energy deployment.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 15:06:00.058324

A community cannot survive on its wealthiest citizens alone. It is the middle- and lower-income brackets that provide the manpower, labor, and the fertile grounds of innovation that a community needs to grow. By not having healthy inventories of quality and affordable middle- and lower-income housing, we are forcibly exiling those demographics.

Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

SEIA and Wood Mackenzie: U.S. solar installs 18 GW in first half of 2025, but warn of potential for sharp declines ahead

The U.S. solar industry delivered nearly 18 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity in the first six months of 2025, even as the Trump administration rolled out policies aimed at slowing clean energy. Solar and storage still accounted for 82% of all new power added to the grid in that period, according to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.

But the report also warns that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (HR1) and recent federal actions could cut deployment forecasts by 44 GW by 2030—an 18% drop compared to the pre-HR1 outlook. Layer in the policies already in place, and the U.S. risks losing 55 GW of solar by 2030, or a 21% decline.

Growth in Trump states, despite federal headwinds

SEIA notes that 77% of new solar capacity this year has been installed in states won by President Trump, including eight of the top 10 markets: Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment … But no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering.”

Manufacturing boom stalls

The U.S. added 13 GW of new module manufacturing capacity in the first half of 2025, with new or expanded factories in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. That brings total domestic module capacity to 55 GW. However, the report flagged that no new upstream manufacturing investments were announced in Q2, citing federal actions that threaten to stall momentum and risk billions in private capital.

Permitting orders create additional risk

The Department of the Interior (DOI) has issued new permitting rules that single out solar for more obstructive treatment, a move Wood Mackenzie analysts say could put 44 GW of planned capacity at risk—particularly in Arizona, California, and Nevada.

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie. “Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment … incredibly challenging.”

Looking ahead

SEIA says near-term growth is still supported by projects already underway, a rush to capture expiring tax credits, and strong power demand as gas generation grows more expensive. But longer term, the report warns that without course corrections, solar deployment will be significantly lower, threatening jobs, reliability, and competitiveness.

President Trump can’t be blamed for the current rise in energy prices.","NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Donald Trump has been racing at breakneck speed to keep all his campaign promises. Yet he has only four months left to fulfill his vow to halve electricity prices by the end of his first year. Fighting against the fallout of the Biden administration’s harmful anti-fossil fuel agenda, the president faces stiff headwinds. The only way the president can meet his self-imposed deadline is to change course quickly, reject Biden’s mistakes and unlock the potential of every available electron.

So far, the trend lines aren’t looking good. In the last year, electricity prices have risen twice as fast as inflation, and the Energy Information Administration estimates that retail electricity prices will continue to outpace inflation through next year, with residential prices surging between 13% to 18% higher than in 2022.

Though, traditionally, consumers have been much more concerned about gas prices — a number they see projected on highway signs and experience firsthand multiple times a month at the pump — the experience of electricity price spikes instead of the promised price cuts will risk diminishing Trump’s popular support.

'WEB OF DARK MONEY' TIED TO OBAMA, DEMS FUELS GREEN OPPOSITION TO CRUCIAL TRUMP ENERGY PLAN

What’s worse, these price hikes will arrive before the midterms, when Trump will be battling to retain his slim congressional majorities.

The current price hikes aren’t Trump’s fault. Instead, he inherited a market with increasing and unprecedented energy demand coupled with the fallout from the Biden administration’s harmful policies to phase out fossil fuels.

Technological innovations like cloud and quantum computing, crypto mining, electric vehicle adoption, streaming services and, most of all, AI data centers, all have tremendous energy demands, which drive electricity prices higher. Rand estimates global AI data centers alone will need 327 GW of energy by 2030. To put that into perspective, the entire state of California used 86 GW of energy in 2022.

'LEFTIST' TAXPAYER-FUNDED ACADEMY SPARKS BACKLASH AFTER MOVING AGAINST TRUMP'S ROLLBACK OF KEY REGULATION

In the face of rising demand, the Biden administration embarked on an aggressive program to curtail legacy energy production. The Biden EPA imposed new emissions restrictions that effectively forced the retirement of coal and natural gas power plants and manipulated regulations across agencies to hem in traditional fuel sources.

If these Biden-era policies didn’t cause the current electricity price spikes, they at least allowed today’s demand-induced price increases to hit consumers unabated.

Trump now has to deal with a crisis not of his own making. With his firm commitments to win the AI race, advance crypto and reshore energy-intensive manufacturing such as semiconductor production, Trump can only keep electricity prices in check by massively increasing supply to meet rising demand.

Unfortunately, his administration appears to be repeating the same mistakes as Biden’s, just colored with a different ideology.

TRUMP BREAKS 'DAY ONE' PROMISE TO LOWER COSTS AS PRICES SURGE ACROSS AMERICA IN FIRST SIX MONTHS

Where the Biden administration cut energy supplies by attacking fossil fuel production, the Trump administration is limiting alternative and renewable energy sources.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

The One Big Beautiful Bill rescinds tax incentives for renewables, while the administration has advanced multiple orders and rules that limit clean energy, from halting offshore wind leases to curbing solar tax credits.

""Drill, baby, drill"" is a great energy policy, but it’s not enough by itself. While America produced nearly enough energy from fossil fuels (86.3 quads) to supply our nation’s entire energy consumption (93.59 quads) in 2023, the fact is, we need alternative energy sources just to meet current demands. When the future requires even more energy, the necessity for alternative energy will only increase.

The cheapest way to put more electrons into the power grid immediately is to erect significantly more solar and energy storage infrastructure, coupled with natural gas peaker plants that can be rapidly turned on during peak hours.

WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR

In the medium term, America needs to increase nuclear energy production, build more energy infrastructure like electric transmission lines and natural gas pipelines, and construct geothermal power plants while deploying grid-enhancing technology, improving demand response and increasing energy efficiency. With the growing adoption of solar and EVs, the United States can even create an aggregated network of residential, virtual power plants that only draw energy in low-use times while feeding energy back into the grid when it’s needed most.

If these Biden-era policies didn’t cause the current electricity price spikes, they at least allowed today’s demand-induced price increases to hit consumers unabated.

The point is, every energy source and efficiency measure must be deployed if we have any hope of keeping prices in check.

President Trump can’t be blamed for the current rise in energy prices. But he could be blamed down the road if his administration continues to limit supply by favoring one source of energy over others. At the end of each month, most consumers don’t care where their energy comes from; they only care that it’s cheap.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/01/nm_solar_panels.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 13:09:09.165376

NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / September 8, 2025 / The two largest companies that provide advice to institutional investors on how to vote their corporate proxies are fighting back against a Texas law that would limit their ability to advise clients on environmental, social and governance practices. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which advises about 2,000 clients for more than 51,000 shareholder meetings, and Glass Lewis, with than 1,300 clients, both filed suit in July to block Texas Senate Bill 2337 that was scheduled to take effect on September 1.

In our Top Stories for the issue, the law firm Gibson Dunn reports that on August 29, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the new Texas law until a trial is held, which is set for February 2, 2026.

According to Gibson Dunn, SB 2337 ""will impose extensive public and directed disclosure obligations on proxy advisory firms when their recommendations or services are based on non-financial factors, which include environmental, social and governance (ESG) and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) considerations, diverge from company management's recommendations, or provide conflicting advice across clients.""

In their lawsuits, ISS and Glass Lewis argued that SB 2337 is unconstitutional since it would violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution by ""forcing the proxy advisors to state that recommendations inconsistent with management or incorporating ESG/DEI are not in shareholders' financial interest.""

Reuters reported in July that the proxy advisors said the new law was an attempt ""to force proxy advisers to broadcast Texas' preferred viewpoints when their own differed, including on hot-button issues that a Republican state legislator perceived as having a ‘hard left bent.'""

The State of Texas, under the leadership of Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, has been at the forefront of Republican efforts to attack ESG and DEI programs at corporations, schools and in government. The state passed a law in 2023 banning DEI offices at public universities and colleges and this year passed a law, which is being challenged by the ACLU, to ban DEI programs in K-12 schools.

In our other Top Stories, Reuters and NPR report that state attorney generals and leading environmental and scientific groups are pushing back against the proposal by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to invalidate the 2009 Endangerment Finding -- which underlies regulations for controlling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reuters reported that Arizona Attorney General Chris Mayes said, ""the EPA is proposing to bury its head in the sand and ignore the mounting costs of climate change for all Americans.""

NPR reports that in August, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy and the EPA alleging that the government's report used to support its proposed repeal of the Endangerment Finding was unlawful since it was created in secret. Public comments regarding the proposed EPA repeal of the Endangerment Finding can be submitted through September 15, with instructions available here.

,Texas Environment,2025-09-08 15:53:18+00:00,Texas Standard,Weak demand and OPEC moves may lower gas prices. But could it hurt Texas oil companies?,David Brown,,,,,https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/energy-texas-oil-gas-prices-opec-supply-hurricane-season/,"The company says it’s part of streamlining and restructuring, but it’s worth noting a number of other oil companies have announced similar plans this year as oil prices and crude oil futures have fallen.
And particularly because there’s that added seasonal element there where you see gas prices lowest – kind of December, January time.
I mentioned these layoffs in the Texas oil industry.
Writ large, what’s the health of the Texas oil industry like as far as you can tell?
We’re already forecasting that production will be lower next year because of the prices being in check.","Newsweek reports Houston-based ConocoPhillips plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce or roughly 3,200 employees and contractors.

The company says it’s part of streamlining and restructuring, but it’s worth noting a number of other oil companies have announced similar plans this year as oil prices and crude oil futures have fallen.

Against that backdrop, some news over the weekend from OPEC, which has been increasing production since April.

Matt Smith, head analyst at Kepler, joined Texas Standard to bring us up to speed on the latest from the energy front. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: So the big news over the weekend: OPEC’s decided to unwind a new tier of production cuts, boosting output essentially. How big a deal is this?

Matt Smith: Well, it’s a big deal from a symbolic perspective, right? Because it signals that OPEC+ believes the market is strong enough to take these additional barrels.

As you mentioned, they’ve already unwound 2.2 million barrels a day of cuts. This latest one is for 1.65 million barrels per day. But the devil is in the details, really, because that’s going to be spread across a year here. So it’s only about 135,000 barrels a day – around that number.

So, the cuts are going to be small and incremental, but also the volume is likely to be lower than announced because some members have been unable to compensate for earlier oversupply here. So yeah, it’s symbolic, really.

Well, I know that there’s been a lot of talk about a potential oil glut. I mean, isn’t this likely to push prices lower? Why are they doing this in the first place?

Well, I think it gives them the flexibility to add more onto the market if they feel that the market can take it. But it is surprising because, to your point, a lot of us that follow oil closely can see oversupply coming.

And so essentially, you’ve got a lot of supply that’s coming from non-OPEC, so from Canada and Norway, but particularly from Guyana and Brazil – so from Latin America. That’s hitting them.

But it’s happening at a seasonal time, as well, when you have weaker demand. So you have refineries going through maintenance. So it’s kind of a double whammy: Stronger supply, weaker demand, and we’re going to get this surplus – causing inventories to be higher and therefore weighing on prices.

So, gasoline prices should follow.

Yeah, exactly. And particularly because there’s that added seasonal element there where you see gas prices lowest – kind of December, January time. So, if we’re at $3.20 on the national average right now, $2.75 for the Texas average, we’re going to be dropping at least a quarter, if not more here in the next month or two.

We’ve got to talk about something else that’s obviously important to the oil industry and certainly important to everyday Texans, too. Wednesday marks the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. Feels like this has been a rather quiet season, no?

It really has and it’s funny because I remember we talked about this before the season started and because it was expected to be more active than usual and that kind of how it’s felt over the last few years. But we’ve only had six named storms five tropical storms, one category 5 hurricane – that was Erin and that didn’t make landfall, that was just whirring in the Atlantic there.

There was the one in Texas, though. The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry caused the deadly flooding in Central Texas there over July 4th holiday. So that was terrible, right, but that’s the limited impact that we’ve seen from the Atlantic hurricane season.

To your point, on Sept. 10, you’re almost guaranteed to see a named storm in the Atlantic and yet there is nothing. We haven’t seen anything recently and there’s nothing on the forecast for the next seven days either.

Complacency? You concerned about any of that?

No, because it ramps up to Sept. 10 and then it ramps down again. And so as long as we can get through September here, it seems like we’ve got away unscathed without having a storm make landfall in Texas.

I mentioned these layoffs in the Texas oil industry. Writ large, what’s the health of the Texas oil industry like as far as you can tell?

It’s starting to be concerning, right? Particularly if we see prices drop below $60 moving towards $55 on WTI by year end here.

What that means is that we’re going to be seeing Texas producers likely shutting in some production. We’re already forecasting that production will be lower next year because of the prices being in check. And so very much a concern on that side of things.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/52730987335_3e904f4304_o-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:21:55.074965

The new plan also has new sections on implementation and advocacy, including a recommendation to update the plan every five years.
The sustainability board’s plan also sits alongside the Edgewater2040 Comprehensive Plan, which has 120 recommendations that mainly cover land use, but touch on some topics similar to the newly updated sustainability plan.
On-Going Actions Update the Sustainability webpage to function as a Community Sustainability Dashboard/resource.
Long-Term Actions Develop a specific youth engagement plan centered around Sustainability to promote long-lasting community benefits.","On Tuesday, the Edgewater City Council heard an update from community leaders on the city’s updated sustainability plan. The plan, which is 25 pages, lists goals and priority actions for the city staff and community members across four major categories: land and water; waste & materials; energy; and social vibrancy.

Andy Rutz, the Principal of Cresendo Planning and Design, provided a briefing to the council. Andy is a consultant to the city, responsible for facilitating the process by which changes were made to the original plan, which was published in 2019. The updated plan reflects the input gathered from six focus groups, 121 respondents to a survey distributed by the city’s Town Cryer newsletter, six board work sessions from October to July, and an April 13 event attended by 35 community members.

Rutz reported that one major framing update was to center “pollution reduction” as a goal that cuts across all four categories of work; among other reasons, community leaders who shaped the plan believe will boost the odds the city receives grant funding from the Denver Regional Council of Governments’ Decarbonize program. The organization was a recipient of a $199M grant from the Environmental Protection Agency. The funds, which were received during the Biden administration in 2024, will be regranted to local governments across the region.

Rutz says the Edgewater community should be proud of the progress the small city has made, in part due to the city’s new sustainability coordinator Shaima Shahbaz. As a result of the progress, the updated plan reorganizes some of the original recommendations to acknowledge the progress that has been made and better delineate the level of attention each will need in the future. The new plan identifies three types of actions under each of the four major categories. Those include:

Priority actions, which the city hopes to achieve in the next five years;

Ongoing actions, which may never be “finished” but will be standards of practice; and,

Long-term actions, which may require significant allocations of staff or financial resources to be achieved.

In total, 42 recommended actions level up to 13 different goals. The actions can be found at the end of this article, or on pages 19-22 of the plan. The goals are:

Land & Water:

Create, protect and sustain a robust urban ecosystem and tree canopy for a healthy community and its residents.

Save and protect water resources for the watershed, as well as current and future residents.

Minimize pollutants and reduce the urban heat island effect through strategic landscape design, green infrastructure, and sustainable development practices.

Improve land and water resilience by enhancing built environment permeability, managing runoff, and investing in nature-based solutions that respond to changing climate conditions.

Waste & Materials

Establish and maintain Edgewater as a leader by increasing residential waste diversion year over year.

Reduce commercial and public sector waste.

Reduce pollution through science-based material selection and infrastructure design.

Energy

Increase energy efficiency opportunities for homes, businesses, government and transportation.

Commit to statewide goals (HB19-1261) to reduce 2030 greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors by at least 50%, and 2050 greenhouse gas emissions by at least 90% of the statewide greenhouse gas emissions that existed in 2005.

Increase the use of clean renewable electricity to 70% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.

Social Vibrancy

Facilitate the expansion of small businesses – prioritizing a walkable environment – to foster a culture of economic, social and environmental resilience for all parties.

Expand communication and outreach to better engage the community.

Foster a community that enables active neighborhood engagement and intergenerational interactions to promote positive relationships and mental health for residents and visitors.

The new plan also has new sections on implementation and advocacy, including a recommendation to update the plan every five years. Rutz specifically commented on the city’s progress in residential areas and on city-owned properties, while naming an opportunity to enroll the city’s business community in the plan more.

Mayor Steve Conklin and Council Member Hannah Gay Kaeo congratulated the sustainability board on the accomplishment. The board includes: Xerxes Steirer (Chair); Jaclyn Poliseo (Vice-Chair); Jeanette Papp; Bruce Perry; Andy Vieth; and Council Member Lilly Steirer.

Gay Kaeo suggested the board work closely with the city’s History, Arts, Recreation, and Parks (HARP) board, which is also updating its strategic plan. The sustainability board’s plan also sits alongside the Edgewater2040 Comprehensive Plan, which has 120 recommendations that mainly cover land use, but touch on some topics similar to the newly updated sustainability plan.

Hawaiʻi and Wisconsin joined the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition last week, increasing membership to 13 state governors.

Launched in May, the coalition aims to promote more affordable electric vehicles, support U.S. automotive manufacturers and preserve states’ authority under the Clean Air Act.

The coalition was formed by the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan group of 24 governors. States will address their own challenges and opportunities while working together to achieve the coalition’s collective goals, the Climate Alliance said in a press release.

Dive Insight:

New electric vehicle sales were strong in the past two months as buyers rushed to take advantage of federal incentives before they expire Sept. 30. However, the share of EVs compared to total automotive sales declined in the second quarter both year-over-year and compared to the first quarter, according to CleanTechnica.

“Sales of EVs will likely fall dramatically when tax credits expire,” said Cox Automotive Senior Economist Charlie Chesbrough in an August 27 statement.

A further blow to EVs came in June when Congress and the Trump administration ended California’s authority to set its own stronger vehicle emission standards. A 1990 federal law allows 17 additional states and the District of Columbia to follow California’s vehicle emissions regulations.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing many of the industry’s automakers and suppliers, supported the administration’s actions. “An aggressive regulatory push toward battery electric vehicles – ahead of consumer demand and without market readiness – will reduce U.S. vehicle production and auto jobs versus a more balanced approach that prioritizes and preserves vehicle choice,” said the group’s president and CEO, John Bozzella, in an April 29 blog post.

The coalition’s 11 initial governors said in a May 23 statement that “The federal government and Congress are putting polluters over people and creating needless chaos for consumers and the market.”

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said in a Sept. 4 statement, “We need to make it easier, not harder, for consumers to upgrade to electric vehicles — and that’s exactly what we’re doing through this state-led partnership.”

The Climate Alliance said it is making resources available to coalition members to help them reduce vehicle pollution and enable consumer access to more affordable zero-emission vehicles.

Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine García said in an emailed statement that the organization is “proud of Hawaiʻi and Wisconsin for joining 11 other states to improve access to electric vehicles at a time when the federal government works to prop up the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our economic well-being and health.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Vh3Q-yrLd0frxR23T1lSKf7mCD9z1fkXoEc-JCJUePg/g:nowe:0:233/c:2500:1412/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjA0NTg4MDQ0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-08 12:16:36.144749

Texas Insider Report: WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) issued the following statement after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a final order approving the Rio Grande LNG facility and the accompanying pipeline. The order clears the way for the energy project to advance.

Sen Cruz said, “I am proud to have led the fight to secure federal authorization for the Rio Grande LNG project. This new LNG export facility supports thousands of jobs in the Rio Grande Valley, brings billions of dollars in investment to the region, and strengthens Texas’s energy leadership. Texas is the energy capital of the world, and I am proud to fight to ensure it stays that way.”

Lending his support along with that of other federal, state, and local elected officials gave voice to the importance of Rio Grande LNG to our nation, Texas, the Rio Grande Valley and our allies around the world.”

BACKGROUND

Sen. Cruz has long been a leader in pushing for American energy dominance and protecting America’s energy workers.

In July, Sen. Cruz sent aletter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to expeditiously reissue the appropriate authority for the Rio Grande LNG project. This project supports thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in the Rio Grande Valley.

In March, Sens. Cruz, Cornyn, Wicker, and Tim Scott reintroduced theProtect LNG Act, which would ensure that a court cannot vacate a previously authorized LNG permit, clarifies the venue for LNG lawsuits before federal courts, and mandates that courts grant expedited decisions in relevant cases. Cruz first introduced this bill in 2024.

Sen. Cruz led a bicameral and bipartisan amicus brief in response to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s decision to vacate the authorizations for the Rio Grande LNG and Texas LNG Brownsville projects. His amicus brief is availablehere andhere. Following the court’s recent decision to reinstate approvals for both projects, Sen. Cruz issued astatement welcoming the ruling.

In 2024, Sen. Cruz, Cornyn and Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño, Jr., authored an op-ed highlighting the U.S. Court of Appeals decision vacating already-issued liquefied natural gas permits in South Texas in a recent op-ed for the Rio Grande Guardian.

His “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in July, will end the federal EV tax credits on Sept. 30.

Until then, eligible buyers can still knock $7,500 off the sticker price—on top of other incentives— but once the deadline is here, the perk disappears. Additionally, the bill has scrapped the penalties for automakers who fail to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.

Just a few years ago, under the Biden administration, automakers were doubling down on EVs. Tax breaks, supportive policies and stricter emissions rules pushed companies to speed up their e-mobility efforts.

But things have changed now. Trump’s rollback of incentives and regulations, along with new tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, is changing the economics of EVs in the United States. The shift is forcing legacy automakers to rethink their electrification plans.

Detroit’s Legacy Carmakers Welcome the Shift

For traditional automakers like General Motors GM and Ford F, the policy change comes as a financial breather. Bloomberg recently reported that this rollback could unlock billions of dollars for Detroit carmakers to reinvest in gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicles.

Ford CEO Jim Farley even called the policy shift a “multibillion-dollar opportunity” for its gas and hybrid business. GM CFO Paul Jacobson echoed the sentiment, saying the removal of fines will start saving the company money as early as 2026.

The reason is simple— without fuel economy fines, Ford and General Motors no longer need to buy regulatory credits from EV-only players. GM has spent $3.5 billion on credits since 2022, while Ford has cut $1.5 billion in similar purchases this year. They can now redirect the money into profitable gas-powered trucks and SUVs.

GM and F currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

GM and Ford Scale Back EV Ambitions

This policy reset is showing up in production plans. GM recently announced it will temporarily cut one shift each for the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ between Sept. 2 and Oct. 6. While the Silverado EV and Sierra EV pickups remain in production, GM has delayed its second electric truck plant and Buick’s first EV by six months. Instead, the automaker revealed $4 billion in spending for mostly gasoline-powered vehicles—clear evidence it’s not betting everything on EVs anymore.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/f7db1b4fdf6819356154790d60da1362,N,,2025-09-08 13:08:40.751947

As it happens, climate activists come much closer than fossil fuels’ defenders to what science and self-interest dictate we must do.
He also served as special assistant to the department’s assistant secretary of energy efficiency and renewable energy.","Paul Bledsoe is a highly respected veteran of America’s climate battles. He has been in the trenches a long time, including a stint in former President Bill Clinton’s Climate Change Task Force. He is now a lecturer at American University.

Writing in The Hill recently, Bledsoe warned that millions of Americans have been turned off by radical “fossil fuel prohibitionists” who want to ban traditional fuels and undermine “average citizens’ ability to enjoy a middle-class lifestyle.”

Of course, it’s the rapid advance of climate change, not opposition to fossil fuels, that most threatens our lifestyles. The climate-action advocates with whom I’m familiar argue (correctly) that a decarbonized economy would allow a considerably better quality of life than Americans enjoy today.

With more than 80 percent of U.S. energy consumption provided by oil, natural gas and coal, 90,000 Americans die prematurely each year because of fossil-fuel pollution. In fact, 156 million live where breathing is unhealthy, and 99.5 percent of congressional districts experienced at least one federally declared weather disaster between 2011 and 2024.

Given those consequences, life without fossil fuels looks inviting. It also looks desirable for pocketbooks. Even without counting the social costs of carbon, electricity generated from unsubsidized sunlight and wind is less expensive than electricity from coal- or gas-fired power plants. That’s been the case for the last 10 years, according to the financial analysis firm Lazard.

It makes little difference to the typical family whether their lights are powered by coal, natural gas, sunlight or wind turbines. However, it makes an enormous difference to the quality of the air they breathe, the outside temperatures, and the price of disaster insurance.

America’s middle-class lifestyles have survived big energy shifts before. This one is admittedly more significant, but so is the danger of more delay.

It has been 60 years since science advisers warned President Lyndon Johnson about the danger of fossil fuel pollution collecting in the atmosphere, and 48 years since President Carter told the nation, “We must start now to develop the new unconventional sources of energy we will rely on in the next century.” Thirty-eight years ago, the government’s chief climate scientist warned Congress that we were running out of time to prevent a global warming disaster. A full 33 years have gone by since the United States signed a treaty to stabilize the atmosphere, and 10 years since the U.S. and 195 other nations agreed to limit global warming. Two years ago, Congress and the Biden administration approved America’s largest-ever federal investment in clean energy.

It has taken President Trump and Republicans in Congress less than eight months to undo it all.

The real enemies of the middle class are the greedy captains of the oil-and-gas sector who continue gaslighting the American people, greenwashing the sector’s reputation, harassing opponents with lawsuits, placing profits above country and conspiring with the best politicians their money can buy.

They scored big with Trump. He is openly defying free-market orthodoxy by manipulating markets to accelerate fossil fuel production and suppress investments in clean energy. Fiscal conservatives should be marching in the streets.

Trump now says his administration will stop approving solar and wind projects. His energy policies arguably violate the federal securities and antitrust laws that prohibit anti-competitive practices. They definitely jeopardize the health and welfare of the American people.

Let’s be clear: It’s the laws of physics, not radical leftists, that determine the Earth’s “carbon budget” and the timing of the energy transition. By mid-century, we must emit no more greenhouse gases than we and nature can absorb. Then we must draw down the gases already in the atmosphere until they return to safe and stable levels — a capability we currently lack.

How disruptive would an adequate energy transition be? President George W. Bush, a former oilman, provided a useful analogy when he characterized America’s oil dependence as an addiction. The state of an addict’s health influences whether they must stop cold turkey or can undergo more gradual withdrawal.

Climate “doctors” say our Goldilocks environment is approaching end-stage failure. As Nature reported two years ago, “Had nations acted earlier to reduce emissions, they could have taken a much more gradual approach to limit warming. Now steep cuts are required.”

The International Renewable Energy Agency says that 90 percent of the world’s electricity can and should come from renewable energy sources by 2050. To get there, the world must double its current investment in solar, wind and other clean energy technologies.

It’s reasonable to ask whether a future without fossil fuels is possible. Reputable experts say an economy powered 100 percent by carbon-free energy is doable. Several have developed roadmaps on how to get there. Despite Trump’s efforts to suppress these technologies, their use is expanding worldwide.

Fossil fuels will not have a role in the future unless the industry eliminates carbon emissions not only at the point of combustion but also across their entire life cycles and value chains. They have yet to develop commercially scalable ways to do that. Even if they did, decarbonizing carbon fuels would significantly increase their costs, which would further cripple their ability to compete with renewable energy.

What will our lifestyles be like in a decarbonized economy? We can ask the neighbors who drive electric vehicles or have solar panels on their roofs. Their beer is still cold, their showers are still hot, and their EVs save money.

“The time for ideology on climate is over,” writes Bledsoe. “Neither the far right nor far left should define the terms of climate politics and policy.” He’s correct. The terms should be defined by science and humanity’s interest in a livable planet. As it happens, climate activists come much closer than fossil fuels’ defenders to what science and self-interest dictate we must do.

The United States is relatively new to making these batteries.
Other critical sectors have used labor from abroad as they build in the United States.
Still, the sweeping nature of the raid could make skilled technicians more apprehensive about coming to the United States, even for short stints.
A contractor died this summer at a battery plant in Holland, Mich., after he got stuck in a machine.","The immigration raid last week on an electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia owned by two South Korean manufacturers was yet another setback for what had been a fast-growing industry in the United States.

The sector was already beleaguered by lower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles, tariffs on raw materials and the rapid phaseout of a federal tax credit for purchases of E.V.s, which have led companies to delay or scale back production.

But the raid at the plant under construction in Ellabell, Ga., which is owned by the carmaker Hyundai and battery supplier LG Energy Solution, raised more risks for foreign manufacturers in the United States. Immigration officials arrested 475 people. Of them, about 300 were South Korean citizens, according to the South Korean foreign minister’s office.

It is not yet clear how many of those detained by ICE last week were building the plant and how many were workers brought in to install and calibrate specialized equipment, or to train the local work force.

Some American workers in the area have complained that they have not been given a fair chance at employment at the $7.6 billion taxpayer-subsidized complex, which has been billed as the largest economic development project in Georgia’s history.

These labor tensions have been building as the federal government, seeking a stronger foothold in the battery business, has wooed foreign companies to expand manufacturing on U.S. soil.

The United States is relatively new to making these batteries. The leading manufacturers are headquartered in Asia, and they typically bring engineers and technicians from their home countries to set up new factories, where assembly lines of robots coat, slice and assemble the components that help power a car. Much of the battery cell technology is proprietary, and there is little margin for error.

“When you don’t have a whole cohort of people who know how to run cell-making factories, you rely heavily on the folks from the home factory,” said Celina Mikolajczak, who was been an executive at battery companies including Panasonic.

That practice has not gone over well with American labor unions that want those jobs, said Betony Jones, who was director of the office of energy jobs at the Department of Energy during the Biden administration.

“E.V. battery companies are very secretive about I.P., so they were bringing in their own workers when it came to installing their machines and maintaining their machines,” she said, referring to intellectual property. “But unions were really pushing for that work.”

Over the weekend, LG Energy Solution said it suspended all U.S. business trips except for customer meetings, conferences and exhibitions, and advised all traveling employees to “immediately return home or remain at their accommodations, considering their current work status.”

The company’s pullback comes as investment in U.S. battery manufacturing was beginning to slow. Tesla’s success in popularizing electric vehicles, paired with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act three years ago, brought a flood of money to the sector. Companies poured roughly $80 billion into U.S. battery manufacturing since the middle of 2022, up from around $10 billion in the three years earlier, according to Rhodium Group, a research firm that tracks investments with M.I.T.’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.

But the business outlook was darkening as E.V. sales fell behind many companies’ lofty expectations. The Trump administration’s efforts this year to raise trade barriers and remake federal energy policy to be more favorable toward fossil fuels introduced new uncertainty and financial challenges. Perhaps most notably, starting next month, electric vehicles will no longer be eligible for a $7,500 tax credit that had helped make the cars more affordable for many buyers.

Other critical sectors have used labor from abroad as they build in the United States. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, for example, relied heavily on labor from Taiwan at its plant on the outskirts of Phoenix.

The raid has also caused outrage in Seoul, where major media outlets ran articles highlighting the poor conditions in which Korean workers would be held, and included a photograph released by ICE of the workers being arrested. News outlets also focused on the difficulty South Korean companies experience in securing work visas for the technicians they need to complete plants in the United States.

South Koreans can enter the United States without a visa for 90 days under a visa-waiver program that allows them to participate in tourism or attend some business meetings, but not full-time work, according to Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research think tank. A temporary business visa, known as B-1, allows for short-term training and consulting, but not full-time construction work.

On Sunday, the two countries reached a deal to free those detainees and send them home to South Korea via a chartered plane, according to Kang Hoon-sik, the chief of staff for President Lee Jae Myung of South Korea.

Still, the sweeping nature of the raid could make skilled technicians more apprehensive about coming to the United States, even for short stints. That could increase the cost of establishing new U.S. factories and slow construction.

“The current situation is creating a dilemma,” said Andrew Yi, a Seoul-based partner for Roland Berger, a consulting firm. Strict enforcement of certain visa rules “would in the short term delay the completion of the factories that are going up.”

Barry Zeigler, business manager of Local 188, a union that represents plumbers, pipe-fitters, welders and HVAC service technicians for 15 counties in Georgia, said South Koreans were working as welders and pipe-fitters in the Georgia plant — jobs that he said should have been given to Americans. He said he had visited the plant in the past, adding that about 65 members of his union were hired by subcontractors to lay pipes there, but were let go a few months ago.

“People think the Koreans are here to do a special job; that’s B.S.,” he said, adding that politicians had turned a deaf ear to his complaints about the factory until the raid.

The plant has been dogged for months by investigative reports by the local TV station WTOC about poor safety conditions and widespread use of unauthorized laborers. At least three workers have died at the megasite, including a man identified as Sunbok You, who was run over by a forklift in March, according to local law enforcement. The police report obtained by the station identified the forklift driver as Sunhwam Bae, who spoke to officers through a translator.

LG Energy Solution has faced safety issues at other plants as well. A contractor died this summer at a battery plant in Holland, Mich., after he got stuck in a machine. And this past weekend, 15 people from the same facility were hospitalized after a chemical spill, according to local news reports.

Ms. Jones, the former Biden administration official, said American workers had a right to be angry if E.V. battery manufacturers were cutting corners with safety and declining to hire and train American workers.

“There are a lot of battery factories being built across the U.S. and their workers are not dying,” she said.

In a statement, LG Energy Solution said the company prioritizes “the safety and well-being of our team” and that its $25 billion investment in North American manufacturing would create about 14,000 jobs in the United States by 2027. Hyundai said the company was “committed to maintaining the highest safety standards.” It also said its employees “are required to comply fully with U.S. laws and regulations.”

The politics are awkward for Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican who embraced the Biden administration’s clean energy policies, showering the project with an estimated $2 billion in tax credits and incentives in a bid to make Georgia the “electric mobility capital of the country.” President Trump has relentlessly attacked both electric vehicles and Mr. Kemp, who resisted Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn 2020 election results in Georgia.

Marie Hodge Gordon, director of communications at the Georgia Department of Economic Development, released a statement that emphasized the fact that electric cars — the Hyundai IONIQ 5 — have already begun rolling off the assembly line at the auto plant on the site. It stressed that the incentives for the project “are based on new, long-term Georgia jobs, not the roles under investigation by law enforcement.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/07/multimedia/00biz-foreign-factory-workers-lcfb/00biz-foreign-factory-workers-lcfb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:16:43.960503

Two months after the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which trimmed the lifespan of most of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits, the industry is still trying to understand the implications of the legislation’s new foreign entity of concern rules and hoping for clarity from upcoming Treasury Department guidance.

“I discuss this almost every day, it seems like,” said Vinson & Elkins tax partner Jenny Speck. “Having clear, administrable rules is the first step, because we already have a statute that creates ambiguity. We’re hearing that this is priority guidance — it should be at the top of their list in terms of what they’re working on.”

The FEOC provisions in OBBBA were expanded from the IRA’s original rule restricting foreign entities of concern – entities with ties to China, Russia, North Korea or Iran – from claiming clean vehicle tax credits. The new FEOC rules apply to the 45X advanced manufacturing credit, the 45Y production credit, and the 48E investment credit.

“We look at wind, solar and 45X as the three that are going to have probably the most rigorous diligence,” Speck said.

Ties to foreign entities of concern “can be such things as 25% or more ownership by a single Chinese shareholder or 40% by two or more such shareholders or at least 15% of total debt held by Chinese lenders, only counting debt holders at original issuance,” law firm Norton Rose Fulbright said in a July article. “Licensing arrangements with Chinese interests can also turn a supplier into a prohibited foreign entity … It is not clear how U.S. developers will be able to spot such arrangements.”

Advait Arun, senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, said he thinks there’s “some understanding of what the cost percentages of prohibited content look like,” but as far as “what kinds of licensing or servicing agreements might violate a FEOC rule, or what kinds of prohibited foreign entities actually are already in these construction processes — I just don’t think we have that clarity yet.”

“Having clear, administrable rules is the first step, because we already have a statute that creates ambiguity. We’re hearing that this is priority guidance — it should be at the top of their list in terms of what they’re working on.”

The Treasury Department and IRS released OBBBA guidance on Aug. 15 clarifying how project developers can prove they commenced construction before the deadline to qualify for the 45Y and 48E tax credits, and said in a footnote that they are “currently drafting additional guidance as is necessary and appropriate” regarding the FEOC rules.

The FEOC rules “are extremely onerous,” said Vinson & Elkins tax partner Lauren Collins. “They are extremely complicated. They have multiple traps for the unwary. If you do not spend a considerable amount of time trying to understand these rules and diligencing ownership structures and debt structures, you’re bound to come into some issues.”

Collins said that as her firm unpacks the rules, they are finding “new issues almost every day, in trying to apply them to real world circumstances.”

“My basic takeaway is there are very few circumstances where taxpayers will actually trip these rules, and actually become a prohibited foreign entity once they’re applied,” she said. “It’s just that they’re so hard to apply and diligence that the administrative burden of proving it out is really the issue. It’s not really a substantive issue of, will we trip this? It’s just, how do we prove it with any level of certainty?”

Resulting industry shifts

Bryen Alperin, a partner and managing director at Foss & Company, also called some of the new FEOC restrictions “onenous” and said being able to meet these new requirements “is going to be one of the greatest challenges for the industry ... it might add a lot of costs in terms of legal compliance, et cetera.”

Alperin said that investors are already starting to opt for 45Y production tax credits over 48E investment tax credits, as the latter are subject under the FEOC rules to potential recapture.

“With an investment tax credit transaction, you get all your tax credits up front in the first year, but they’re going to have a ten year compliance period where they could have their credits recaptured,” Alperin said. “Let’s say that you build a solar power plant in 2028 and you claim your tax credits in 2028. Our investor gets their tax credit, and then eight years later — there might even be a new owner of the project at that point, we’re no longer involved, and somebody accidentally hires a Chinese company to do maintenance on the project.”

In that scenario, the tax credit from eight years ago could be recaptured, Alperin said.

“That’s, I think, the big worry — that no matter what the rule ends up being, once the administration releases it, that you just have a quite substantial compliance burden that you have to take on yourself. And then, of course, there’s the greater legal risk — where the IRS’s statute for recapture is also longer now, in a way that puts you on the hook for a much longer time period.”

“That’s got a lot of our investors nervous,” Alperin said. “A lot of our investors who used to only do solar are now looking at doing wind transactions, because those generate production tax credits. In the future, we might see more solar projects electing to go with production tax credits instead of these investment tax credits, because there’s going to be a bit of a risk premium applied to the investment tax credit that investors will be uncomfortable with.”

Arun said the FEOC rules also inherently disadvantage small developers, who have fewer resources to devote to ensuring supply chain compliance.

“That’s, I think, the big worry — that no matter what the rule ends up being, once the administration releases it, that you just have a quite substantial compliance burden that you have to take on yourself,” he said. “And then, of course, there’s the greater legal risk — where the IRS’s statute for recapture is also longer now, in a way that puts you on the hook for a much longer time period.”

Developers are also shifting their strategies in response to guidance that the Treasury Department released in August, which stipulated that construction on most wind and solar projects is considered to have begun “when physical work of a significant nature begins,” instead of when 5% or more of the total cost of the project has been paid. Solar facilities with a net output of less than 1.5 MW can still use the 5% test.

“[The physical work test] is definitely a little bit more subjective,” Arun said. “With 5%, if you have your contracts, if you’ve demonstrated payments, it’s easy enough to show those to the IRS and to verify. But the other thing that they changed about the physical work test is there’s a difference in language now between ‘physical effort’ versus ‘program of construction’, where payments and contracts just simply don’t count anymore toward a facts or circumstances based-analysis the IRS might run.”

The IRS now has “discretion” in a way that adds “more squishiness” to the process, Arun said.

Alperin noted that the Trump administration is moving toward more subjective discretion in general, putting pressure on solar and wind projects “not just with the IRA, but also with permits that may not be granted — that used to be just trivial, standard permits that the government would grant.”

Overall, Alperin said the industry is still digesting the physical work test guidance, “but from what I’ve heard, it’s not as impactful as some feared it may be.” He said it “was a relief” that the commence construction guidance “wasn’t retroactive, and that it didn’t really change the playing field that much.”

Collins said she and her colleagues view the latest guidance as “very workable.”

“We’re seeing many clients and developers start acting in response to it, and start engaging in the various forms of significant physical work in order to safe harbor their wind and solar projects,” she said. “The physical work test has been used for well over a decade. We have pretty clear rules on how to apply it that weren’t changed, and it’s cheaper than the 5% safe harbor method.”

Collins noted, though, that the 5% test “is not subjective. It is, you know, you pay that amount and you’re safe harbored, and that has a level of certainty that the industry has liked. But the significant physical work method has really gained favor over the years and is well established.”

Like the lack of clarity around FEOC rules, Arun said, the move away from the 5% test may disadvantage developers large enough not to qualify for the 1.5 MW solar exemption but small enough to be a “minnow” instead of a shark.

“Obviously, I think everyone’s correct in arguing that this isn’t the worst case scenario for the industry,” he said. “But I think the ability to prove to the IRS conclusively that you’ve begun construction, that you’re performing construction activities, relies on having the kind of market share and relationships in the market already that allow you to have already built gigantic pipelines of these projects.”

Wind and solar projects that commence construction before July 4 next year can still qualify for the placed-in-service deadline of Dec. 31, 2030, under a safe harbor provision, while projects that commence construction after that have to be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify.

In addition, the OBBBA includes a provision that projects that start construction by the end of 2025 are not subject to some of the new FEOC restrictions. In response, developers are pushing to get projects under construction as quickly as possible, Alperin said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/1rGNnJLZKG1MeAHIDelHD6xPDVErj91CIeVavk2zDuA/g:nowe:0:325/c:3200:1807/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9XSU5EXzIuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-08 12:16:55.926148

According to Bloomberg, GM will start production on its Chevrolet Bolt EV in December with one shift at its plant in Kansas. Two shifts were originally planned for Bolt production.

Production will also be reduced at GM’s Spring Hill, Tennessee assembly plant to one shift from January through May, Bloomberg reports. The plant builds the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq EVs. It also builds the ICE Cadillac SUVs.

“General Motors is making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand,” the company said in a statement to Bloomberg.

GM reported Tuesday that it set an all-time monthly record for EV sales in August, ahead of the expiration of the EV tax credits.

“August was our best month ever for EV sales — and we expect that buying surge to pay long-term dividends, given our industry-leading manufacturer loyalty, and EV customers’ overwhelming commitment to the technology,” a statement posted to the company’s website from Duncan Aldred, GM senior vice president and North America president, says. “I’m grateful to our team and our dealers for helping us outperform nearly every EV competitor.”

He notes in the statement that strong demand will likely remain in September, but the market is expected to shrink after the credit expiration.

Other OEMs reported strong EV sales as the tax credits near expiration. For example, Ford reported August U.S. sales increased by 3.9% to 190,206 vehicles sold in the month compared with the year-ago August, according to Yahoo Finance.

“There’s no doubt we’ll see lower EV sales next quarter after tax credits end September 30, and it may take several months for the market to normalize,” Aldred wrote. “We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won’t overproduce. Still, we believe GM can continue to grow EV market share.”

He points to some positives with EVs, with the expansion of public fast-charging bays across the country. He writes that customers will have access to more than 65,000 bays by the end of the year. GM expects that to grow by 80,000 by the end of next year and 100,000 by the end of 2027.

Mercedes-Benz is also pausing U.S. production of its EV models ahead of the rebate expiration, including the EQE and EQS models.

The company initiated a “fire sale” of its electric models ahead of the expiration of the tax credit. Other companies, such as Tesla and Ford, have also offered deals in recent months.

It’s RE+ week, and this edition of Projects Weekly is jam packed with news. Starting things off, ContourGlobal has begun operations at the new Black Hollow Sun I (BHS I) site, a 185 MWp solar facility near Severance, Colorado, the company’s first in the United States. Plus, Aspen Power has acquired two community solar projects in New Jersey totaling just over 1 MWdc; Soluna Holdings has surpassed 1 GW in renewable energy-powered computing facilities with the energizing of two new sites in Texas; Standard Solar has expanded its commercial PPA portfolio with a 13.7 MW solar project for a Maryland-based healthcare system; Encore Renewable Energy has energized its first energy storage system at Middlebury College; Aspen Power has acquired two Illinois solar projects for a total of 13.9 MW generating capacity; RES has signed a contract with Repsol to provide operations and maintenance services for utility-scale solar projects in the United States; Euclid Power has secured a $20 million Series A funding to support renewable energy projects; SolarEdge Technologies and Arch Solar have completed a rooftop solar project at a Wisconsin high school; and Catalyze secured $200 million to support renewable energy growth in the United States.

ContourGlobal’s first U.S. renewable energy facility comes online in Colorado

ContourGlobal has started operations at Black Hollow Sun I (BHS I), a 185 MWp solar photovoltaic facility located near Severance, Colorado. BHS I represents the UK-based company’s first operating renewable plant in the United States and the initial phase of the Black Hollow Sun complex, which will also include BHS II (139 MWp). When fully completed in 2026, the power complex will reach a total capacity of 324 MWp, making it Northern Colorado’s largest solar project and Platte River’s largest contracted solar asset.

Once fully operational, the complex will produce around 608 GWh of renewable energy each year, which will be delivered to Platte River Power Authority, the community-owned utility serving Fort Collins, Loveland, Estes Park, and Longmont. ContourGlobal is using American-manufactured solar modules supplied by its partner Qcells, which is also providing its integrated EPC solutions for this project.

Cool factor: This milestone marked a highlight of ContourGlobal’s 20th anniversary celebrations, underscoring both its origins in the United States two decades ago and its commitment to becoming a predominantly renewable independent power producer (IPP) also through other relevant investments in the country.

“The start of operations at Black Hollow Sun I is a pivotal moment for ContourGlobal, marking our first U.S. renewable plant to reach operational state, and especially meaningful as we celebrate our 20th anniversary since the company was incorporated in the U.S.,” said Antonio Cammisecra, CEO of ContourGlobal. “This project, together with Black Hollow Sun II targeted for completion by the end of 2026, exemplifies our strategy to deliver clean, reliable power while strengthening our commitment to local communities and partners such as Platte River Power Authority”.

The completion of BHS I adds 185 MWp of new renewable capacity to ContourGlobal’s overall U.S. portfolio, which now totals 2.8 GW of power generation capacity in operation, under construction or in late-stage of development. ContourGlobal’s planned renewable capacity in the United States includes an additional 1 GW of solar PV and 0.3 GW of battery energy storage system (BESS) projects at various stages of maturity, from late development to advanced construction.

Aspen Power closes on community solar project acquisitions in New Jersey

Aspen Power has acquired two community solar projects in New Jersey from Ecogy Energy. Totaling just over 1 MWdc of solar capacity, the projects, located in Millville (South Jersey) and Ocean Township (Monmouth County), were initially developed by Ecogy Energy and are approaching the start of construction.

“Collaboration is essential to accelerating the clean energy transition, and our partnership with Ecogy Energy demonstrates how working together can deliver results where they matter most,” said Dan Gulick, executive VP of Community Solar for Aspen Power. “Solar is now the most affordable source of new power in America, and even with challenging political headwinds, we are successfully bringing projects online that lower costs for subscribers, generate reliable income for property owners, and support New Jersey’s ambitious clean energy goals. By building on Ecogy’s strong foundation, we are not only helping to decarbonize the grid, but also driving long-term economic and environmental benefits for local communities. At this critical moment for renewable energy, strong partnerships between developers and operators will be the key to sustained growth.”

Cool factor: Together, the projects are expected to produce more than 1.1 million kWh in their first year. The acquisition is part of a series of deals Aspen Power announced spanning four states. The projects are in Atlantic City Electric and Jersey Central Power & Light utility territories and will provide subscribers a discount on prevailing utility rates. By pairing Ecogy Energy’s community-centered development with Aspen Power’s financing and operational expertise, the partners are helping more New Jersey residents access affordable renewable energy and contribute to a cleaner future.

“These projects are a great representation of Ecogy’s continued focus on developing the mid-market commercial and industrial distributed energy resources space,” said Jack Bertuzzi, principal at Ecogy Energy. “It’s great to have a partnership with Aspen Power, who see the value in these distributed generation projects, and the outsized value they bring to the grid and the surrounding communities.”

Soluna surpasses 1 GW of clean computing capacity

Green data center developer Soluna Holdings Inc. has reached a key milestone with 1 GW of clean computing projects in either operation, construction, or development, positioning the company to lead the way in sustainable data center development in the United States. The milestone was reached with the launch of two new Texas-based sites: Project Fei, a solar-powered facility in northern Texas, and Project Gladys, a wind-powered facility in the southeast region of the state.

“Reaching one gigawatt of clean computing projects in our total development pipeline is a transformative moment for Soluna. Getting these projects from development to operational will put us on par with some of the biggest companies in the world when it comes to clean-powered computing capacity, including Amazon, Meta, and Google,” said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna.

Cool factor: Project Fei is a 100 MW data center co-located with a 240 MW utility-scale solar farm, Soluna’s second solar-based project to date. Developed in partnership with a global leader in energy infrastructure investment, Project Fei will convert underutilized solar energy into clean, high-performance computing power. The project is currently advancing through land acquisition, power contract negotiation, and ERCOT interconnection planning. The project honors Dr. Fei-Fei Li, a pioneering AI researcher, whose work, including the creation of ImageNet, has helped shape the modern era of artificial intelligence and ethical computing.

Project Gladys, a 150 MW facility, will be co-located with a 226 MW wind farm and developed in partnership with a U.S.-based independent power producer (IPP). The project is currently advancing through land acquisition, power contract negotiation, and ERCOT interconnection planning. It is named after Dr. Gladys West, the mathematician whose groundbreaking work in geospatial modeling paved the way for modern GPS technology.

Standard Solar grows commercial PPA portfolio with 13.7 MW solar project in Maryland

Standard Solar has added another commercial power purchase agreement (PPA) to its rapidly growing portfolio. The agreement with a leading Maryland-based healthcare system will enable it to power facilities with renewable energy with no upfront or development costs.

The completed and operational 13.7 MW Costen Solar Farm will supply the healthcare system, one of the largest energy consumers and employers serving Maryland, with electricity under a 20-year PPA with Standard Solar, the project’s owner and operator.

“Healthcare systems are among the most energy-intensive institutions in our communities, and projects like this show how PPAs can help them decarbonize without financial or operational risk,” said Mike Streams, chief development officer at Standard Solar. “By structuring agreements that remove upfront costs and deliver predictable clean energy, we’re enabling healthcare providers and other large energy users to meet sustainability commitments, lower emissions and focus resources where they matter most, on patient care.”

Cool factor: Engineered to deliver approximately 19,700 MWh of electricity in its first year, the project aligns with the system’s mission to reduce its carbon footprint, support its sustainability goals and contribute to Maryland’s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard. Hospitals are known for high energy demands due to their 24/7 operations.

“Partnering on the Costen Solar Farm shows how Standard Solar can deliver clean energy solutions in sectors with the highest energy demands,” said John Finnerty, director of business development at Standard Solar. “This project is a model for other large energy consumers in Maryland, proving that clean power can be delivered efficiently into PJM accounts while advancing sustainability and financial goals. It’s also a testament to the strong collaboration between our team, Choptank Electric Cooperative and PJM.”

Encore Renewable Energy has energized South Street Storage, a 2 MW / 8 MWh utility-scale battery energy storage system, located next to the South Street Solar project in Middlebury, Vermont. South Street Storage is Encore’s first energy storage project and will provide vital demand mitigation services and cost savings to Green Mountain Power (GMP) and its customers.

“The past few years of intense storms and record heat have demonstrated the importance of a dependable electric grid, and we need more energy storage for that,” said Encore founder and co-CEO Chad Farrell. “Thankfully there are leading utilities like Green Mountain Power, who have long understood the value of locally sited energy storage for keeping our electricity supply clean and affordable.”

Cool factor: The 2MW energy system at South Street adds to GMP’s growing network of stored energy, now over 75 MW, making it Vermont’s largest source of dispatchable power. The lithium-ion battery systems for this project were provided by KORE Power, a leading domestic manufacturer of battery energy storage systems, which also built the units installed by Encore at its Waterbury, Vermont, facility. KORE’s operation’s team will also be coordinating with Encore to monitor the system’s performance.

“The South Street Storage project is a model of well-orchestrated grid modernization that is made possible when a developer, a manufacturer and a utility share the vision of delivering safe, reliable, clean power to customers,” said Jay Bellows, CEO of KORE Power. “Through this coordination the teams from Encore, KORE and Green Mountain Power will deliver affordable power that is there when it is needed.”

Aspen Power acquires 2 Illinois solar projects totaling 13.9 MW

Aspen Power has acquired two community solar projects in Illinois with a combined capacity of 13.9 MWdc. Located in Grafton and Mattoon, the projects are expected to generate over 19 million kilowatt-hours (kWh), which is the clean energy equivalent to powering 2,770 homes each year.

The projects were acquired from Greenwood Sustainable Infrastructure (GSI) and are part of a larger portfolio spanning Illinois and New York, which also includes sites nearing final completion.

Illinois has emerged as a strong market for community solar, driven by the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which expands access to renewable energy, particularly for low- and moderate-income households. Aspen Power’s acquisition builds on recent momentum in the state, including the company’s recent MIPDSA closing on a 14.1 MW Illinois portfolio and its announced partnership to acquire 20 additional community solar projects totaling up to 19 MW, primarily in Illinois.

Cool factor: The Grafton and Mattoon sites will operate as community solar gardens, delivering clean energy directly to local residents and businesses. Subscribers will receive a discount on their electricity bills, and the projects are expected to support approximately 265 jobs, based on estimates from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

“By supporting the state’s ambitious renewable energy goals, we are helping to decarbonize the grid while delivering lasting economic and environmental benefits to local communities,” said Jorge Vargas, CEO of Aspen Power.

RES signs solar O&M contract with Repsol for 1.5+ GWp in the United States

Independent renewable energy company RES has signed a significant contract with Repsol to provide operations and maintenance (O&M) services for more than 1.5 GWp of utility-scale solar projects in the United States.

The agreement covers four major solar projects across Texas and New Mexico, including the 825 MWp Pinnington and 620 MWp Outpost projects in Texas, and the 120 MWp Jicarilla I and II projects in New Mexico – two key states for US solar expansion. The deal strengthens RES’ presence in North America and marks another milestone in its strategic partnership with Repsol.

Cool factor: RES will deploy a specialist field team to ensure optimal performance and operational excellence, while also creating new jobs in the region’s clean energy sector.

“This is a major step forward in our U.S. growth strategy and a clear signal of confidence in our O&M solutions,” said Jean-Claude Robert, senior VP of services North America at RES. “We’re proud to build on our long-standing relationship with Repsol and to support the expansion of high-performance solar in the U.S. and beyond.”

Euclid raises $20M to accelerate renewable energy projects

Euclid Power has secured $20 million in Series A funding to support the expansion of the company’s AI-driven workflows to support renewable energy project development. The funding round was led by Venrock, with participation from HSBC Asset Management and existing investors including Spero Ventures, Toba Capital, Designer Fund, and Commonweal Ventures.

“With this round, we’re scaling to meet the urgency of the clean energy transition,” said Jacob Sandry, CEO of Euclid. “Our customers are navigating regulatory friction and market uncertainty every day to supply power that people desperately need. We help them move through that complexity faster, with the precision their projects demand.”

Cool factor: Euclid serves as a single source of information for renewable energy teams, transforming scattered project documentation into actionable intelligence. Its AI engine automatically tags documents, extracts key data points — cost lines, deadlines, risk indicators, and more — and collates them into a single, up-to-date source of project information.

Since its inception, Euclid has onboarded more than 12 GW of solar and storage capacity, and supported over $10 billion in renewable energy investments.

SolarEdge, Arch Solar complete rooftop PV system Wisconsin high school

SolarEdge Technologies and Arch Solar have collaborated on the completion of a rooftop solar project at Nicolet Union High School in Glendale, Wisconsin. Since coming online in fall 2024, the system has been generating clean energy and reducing operational costs for the school while serving as a hands-on educational resource for students.

Designed and installed by Arch Solar, the system spans seven distinct rooftop sections and uses TerraGen racking at 15° and 23° tilts. The design overcame complex challenges, including varying roof heights, shading, and structural limitations. Using SolarEdge Designer, the project team optimized the layout and production while incorporating future scalability into the electrical and inverter infrastructure.

Cool factor: The solar array — featuring 715 high-efficiency modules and three SolarEdge SE100K-US inverters — has produced more than 477 MWh of electricity in its first operational year. The system now powers nearly 19% of the school’s annual energy needs, delivering more than $52,000 in annual utility savings, with a projected lifetime savings of $2.2 million. Additionally, the system offsets hundreds of tons of carbon emissions annually, aligning with the school’s goals for environmental stewardship and financial responsibility.

“This wasn’t just another install; it was a community investment,” said Andrew Holmstrom, business development supervisor at Arch Solar. “Many of our employees live nearby, and my own kids will one day attend Nicolet High School. Knowing that they’ll be learning under the same roof that we’ve helped transform with clean energy makes this incredibly personal. It’s not just about panels, it’s about setting an example for the next generation and showing our community what’s possible when you invest in sustainability.”

The project was part of a broader $80 million campus renovation initiative and was supported by federal and state incentives, including the Inflation Reduction Act and Wisconsin’s Focus on Energy program. With these incentives, Nicolet cut its anticipated solar project costs in half, resulting in a payback period of just 6.4 years.

Catalyze secures $200M to accelerate renewable energy growth

[A recent Carbon Brief factcheck has highlighted more than 100 false or misleading statements in the report.]","Chris Wright, the climate-sceptic US energy secretary, has dismissed the impacts of climate change as “not incredibly important” and described the Paris Agreement as “silly”, reports the New York Times. Speaking at a thinktank on Friday, Wright – a former fracking executive – defended the Trump administration’s decision to block a nearly complete $6.2bn windfarm off the coast of Rhode Island “by saying offshore wind increases electricity prices and by downplaying the jobs at stake”, the newspaper says. It quotes an academic who points out that “there’s no evidence for that”. Regarding the impact of warming on quality of life, Wright claimed that, “in fact, if it wasn’t in the news, in the media, you wouldn’t know”, the article reports. It continues: “Wright said the focus in the US to transition away from fossil fuels had hurt the country. It’s a message he said he intended to take on a multileg trip next week to Europe, where he will encourage countries to buy more American gas. The US is currently the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas as well as the largest producer of oil.”

Speaking to reporters after the event, Wright said there was a “very active dialogue in the administration” over the fate of the blocked windfarm, Bloomberg reports. It notes: “Earlier this year, the Trump administration lifted a similar stop-work order for a windfarm being built near New York after reaching an agreement with the state’s governor over new energy projects.” Ørsted – the Danish firm developing the blocked project – has won shareholder approval for a $9.4bn emergency rights issue for new shares to “help fund US projects thrown into uncertainty”, Reuters reports. Meanwhile, E&E News says that a federal court was “sceptical” about whether it could order a pause on Trump’s presidential action – issued in January – ordering agencies to stop issuing or renewing permits for onshore and offshore wind projects.

Canadian prime minister Mark Carney has announced a delay to minimum sales targets for electric vehicles – due to come into force next year – as the industry “deals with US president Donald Trump’s tariffs”, the Associated Press reports. Canadian car manufacturers will no longer have to meet the target, established by then-prime minister Justin Trudeau in 2023, requiring that 20% of cars sold in 2026 should be zero-emission, the newswire explains. Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Carney said: “We have an auto sector that, because of the massive change in US trade policy, is under extreme pressure…The EV mandate adds to the liquidity issues they have…They’ve got enough on their plate right now so we are taking that off,” the article notes. The Canadian government will launch an “immediate 60-day review” to reduce costs linked to the EV sales requirement, says Al Jazeera. It notes that Carney also announced a new C$370m (£198m) biofuel production incentive. Politico, Bloomberg, BBC News, Financial Times, Reuters and CBC News all have the story.

The World Nuclear Association (WNA) has warned that a revival in nuclear energy could trigger a shortfall in uranium supplies unless new sources are found, says the Financial Times. In a report published on Friday, the industry lobby group projects that global uranium demand for reactors is set to rise by one-third to 86,000 tonnes by 2030 and to 150,000 tonnes by 2040, the newspaper explains: “But output from today’s mines is expected to halve between 2030 and 2040 as existing deposits are exhausted, leaving a ‘significant gap’ that threatens the nuclear power revival. The report called on the industry to secure investment to locate more uranium and extract it from current as well as new and idle mines to avoid a supply crunch.” According to the WNA, uranium demand is set to increase as more governments rely on nuclear power to meet zero-carbon targets, says Reuters, adding: “Concerns over energy security and independence due to geopolitical factors have also boosted interest in nuclear power, it said.”

In other news, Greg Jackson – the chief executive of Octopus Energy – has said that the UK should stop investing in carbon capture and storage (CCS) for use in energy systems, reports the Financial Times. Speaking at the FT Weekend Festival on Saturday, Jackson said: “It’s a boondoggle for oil and gas and we would be better off in the UK just burning unabated gas, because the cheaper we make electricity, the cheaper our heat pumps and electrics cars are going to be, and they are the key to emissions reductions.” The Sunday Telegraph has also interviewed Jackson and leads its coverage with his criticism of curtailment fees, which the newspaper describes as the “sums handed to windfarms to switch off when the grid is too congested to handle their power”. Jackson is also not opposed to renewed drilling in the North Sea, telling the newspaper: “When we’re shipping LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world, it is a lot dirtier than using locally produced gas…If we’re going to produce gas then I’ve got no problem in using local stuff.” [A Carbon Brief factcheck shows that CO2 emissions from UK production are only around 15% lower than those from LNG imports.]

There is widespread reaction to – and analysis of – policy proposals by the UK’s hard-right, populist Reform party after its two-day conference ended on Saturday. BBC News’s Ben Chu – a policy and analysis correspondent in the BBC Verify team – assesses Reform’s economic plans, including its claims that it could save £30bn every year for the next 25 years by scrapping net-zero targets. Chu notes that two-thirds of the £30bn “fiscal cost” of the net-zero transition, as estimated by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), would be down to lost fuel-duty receipts, if people continued to switch to electric vehicles “and the government did not replace fuel duty with a new levy on road users”. Chu notes that “it’s also important to bear in mind that the OBR stresses the economic and fiscal costs to the UK” if net-zero is not achieved globally. The OBR estimates that around 3C of climate change “could add 2% of GDP to UK primary borrowing (before interest costs) by the early 2070s”, Chu adds.

Meanwhile, the Guardian’s environment reporter Helena Horton speaks to Reform members, noting that their positions on climate change and energy are more “nuanced” than the party’s leadership. The Associated Press reports that “some of the positions” that Reform leader Nigel Farage “shares with Trump, such as opposition to net-zero climate goals, are unpopular in Britain”. However, Times columnist Fraser Nelson says that fringe debates at the Reform conference are on how to abolish net-zero and promote “climate realism”. He says these events “seem a lot more popular” than the pro-net-zero talks at other party conferences. The Press Association reports that three climate protesters were removed from the conference “after shouting at Nigel Farage while he was on stage”. Finally, the Financial Times speaks to Jonathan Brown, lead of the pro-Reform UK thinktank, the Centre for a Better Britain (CBB), who says his second priority – after the UK’s fiscal situation – will be to focus on UK energy policy and “how to rebalance objectives in terms of net-zero not being the top priority”.

Writing the Financial Times, James Meadway – senior director for economics at the Opportunity Green thinktank – says that the Trump administration’s “America First” policies are “opening new spaces for action on climate change”. While ”this has not been immediately obvious”, Meadway says, new analysis from his thinktank shows that “some effects of its tariffs are actually likely to be positive for climate change”. He cites a reduction in shipping as trade falls, noting: “The benefit here is that even relatively small differences in weights and transport distances, as goods are rerouted or resourced, can add up to meaningful reductions in emissions across a massive global trading system”. Another benefit is that imported goods might be replaced with local production, or the “recycling, repair and reuse of existing products”, he says.

Elsewhere, in a Guardian “featured essay”, veteran climate activist Bill McKibben writes that solar power is the “climate solution both the right and the left can get behind”.

But before rejoicing, consider what might be a kind of gas price dilemma.

This dilemma highlights conflicting goals and challenges that fuel prices raise, as well as different perspectives on energy policy. While drivers may be pleased about the relatively low gas prices, those who work in the industry may not.

Both affect the economy.

Gas prices affect transportation costs, travel and consumer confidence.

And there’s the environmentalist, who is concerned about carbon emissions and sometimes makes the case that, overall, higher gas prices are good for the planet as an incentive for people to seek and use alternative energy sources.

Emissions, they argue, are affecting climate change and producing more extreme weather and all sorts of disasters, like violent hurricanes, ice storms and droughts that cost money.

With West Texas Intermediate, a grade of crude oil, trading at about $63 a barrel, gas prices are still relatively low, 13 cents less a gallon than last week and more than $2 a gallon less than in 2022, when gasoline prices hit an all-time high.

According to AAA, the highest prices on Sept. 7 in Michigan, on average, were in Ann Arbor, $3.27 a gallon; metro Detroit, $3.26; and Benton Harbor, $3.18; the lowest, in Traverse City, $3.04; and Flint and Saginaw, $3.05.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, which also tracks gas prices, noted that Michigan and some other Great Lakes states ""saw significant relief thanks to the restart of BP’s Whiting, Indiana, refinery.""

Severe weather caused a temporary outage.

But, he said, the West Coast may see continued increases due to seasonal refinery maintenance and the shutdown of a refinery in southern California, which will keep the supply tight.

Additionally, he added, OPEC+ — a group of oil-producing nations — announced an increase in oil production starting in October, which could help keep oil prices lower for longer.

At the same time, because of the low oil prices, oil-industry companies have been laying off workers, which, overall, is also not good for the economy.

ConocoPhillips, headquartered in Houston, was one of the latest to announce job cuts. The company this week said it would slice off up to 25% of its global staff, starting before the holidays.

The news came as data showed a spike in job cuts in August nationwide and a worsening economic outlook contradicted Trump’s claim that the economy is the hottest it has been in years.

But the news also could nudge the Fed to lower interest rates.

Global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said job cuts in August were up 39% from July, and up 13% from the same month a year ago. August’s total, the firm said, was the highest for the month since 2020.

ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, in a Sept. 4 meeting with employees, blamed the cuts, in part, on acquisitions, Reuters reported. ConocoPhillips bought Marathon Oil a year ago, and Concho Resources and Permian assets from Shell in 2021.

But Reuters reported more than a dozen oil companies since 2024 are laying off workers, and that the oil industry job reductions undermine the president’s ""promise to increase U.S. oil and gas production and its clout in global markets.""

In February, Chevron said it would cut 15%-20% of its global workforce, and the month before that, it was reported BP would cut more than 5% of its global workforce to reduce costs and boost investor confidence.

The Trump administration has been working to overhaul America’s energy policy, rolling back emissions regulations and relaxing permitting rules, which should help boost the bottom line of fossil fuel companies.

U.S. oil prices averaged closer to $75 a barrel in 2024, and $78 a barrel the year before that. In 2022 — when, according to AAA, gas in Michigan hit a high of $5.22 a gallon — oil was trading at about $95 a barrel.

In late June, a group of tribes, nonprofits and local governments sued the administration for what they said was an unlawful termination of the EPA’s Environmental and Climate Justice Grant programs “despite a congressional directive to fund them.”

Earthjustice, Southern Environmental Law Center, the Public Rights Project and Lawyers for Good Government filed the challenge on behalf of ECJ grant recipients to seek the restoration of the nationwide program and to require the reinstatement of awarded grant agreements, according to a press release from Earthjustice.

The 23 plaintiffs involved in the lawsuit sought to restore the $3 billion that was promised to “community-driven” projects across the country, including $20 million to Springfield for various initiatives combatting climate change.

That money is now in jeopardy after Judge Richard Leon in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia decided to dismiss the challenge on Aug. 29, ruling that the claims must be heard by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

“We are disappointed in the court’s ruling, but we will continue to fight for communities across the country that relied on this EPA program to reduce pollution, increase climate resilience and build capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Earthjustice senior attorney Hana Vizcarra, in a statement. “The legal team is considering next steps.”

In a statement to Reminder Publishing, Springfield City Solicitor Stephen Buoniconti called the judge’s decision “disappointing.”

“The court ruled that the grant was in essence a contract and that the Trump administration has the executive authority to rescind the funding,” Buoniconti said. “The court decision is a major loss for the residents of the city and the region.”

The $20 million was supposed to fund a community solar project, complete home rehabilitation projects, plant 1,500 trees throughout the city and retrofit 30 one-to-four-unit homes to improve indoor air quality.

Additionally, the money would support a workforce development program for HVAC-R technicians and convert two city-owned buildings to non-grid clean energy sources while expanding their use as community resilience hubs and emergency shelter locations.

That money and other grants were part of the Environmental and Climate Justice Program, which was created by former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act under Clean Air Act Section 138. The grants were eliminated across the country in early 2025 as part of Trump’s efforts to down size the role of the federal government in energy and environmental spaces.

In his statement, Buoniconti said that Springfield was the only city in the state to receive the grant, the bulk of which was going to reduce asthma and lead exposure. In 2019, Springfield was dubbed the “asthma capital of the country,” according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, and was named the fourth most challenging place to live with asthma as of 2024.

A key tax policy change in the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' means a federal tax credit that made it cheaper for Americans to buy an electric vehicle will expire after this month. Additionally, a 25% tariff on automobiles and parts from most countries, as well as other duties, are set to push vehicle prices higher.

EV Sales Are Set To Jump

The tax credits give buyers $7,500 off their 2025 tax bill if they purchase a new clean vehicle and $4,000 for a used clean vehicle — until Sept. 30, 2025. Buyers will get the credit if they have entered into a written contract and made a payment, which includes a down payment or a vehicle trade-in, before the month ends.

This month, many dealers are making a ""final, aggressive push to move remaining inventory,"" Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, said in a press release. EV dealers are using advertising and promotions to bring more consumers in the door, said Brent Gruber, executive director of the electric vehicle practice at J.D. Power.

And it seems to be working. EVs are expected to account for 12% of all the cars bought in August — an all-time high. The boost was driven by consumers moving up their car purchases to beat the expiration of the EV tax credit, King said.

Tariffs Will Also Hike Prices

On top of the tax credits going away, King said tariffs are expected to increase the price of an average EV by $4,275. So far, car manufacturers have been able to offset many of the cost increases from tariffs, but they can't continue to do so long-term, Gruber said.

""Ultimately, what you'll see is prices rising on all vehicles,"" Gruber said. ""When it comes to electric vehicles, specifically, and you factor in the loss of that $7,500 tax credit, you could be talking about a product that is considerably more expensive a month from now than it is right now. It could be a double whammy for electric vehicles.""

Gruber said consumers who have been thinking about purchasing an EV should do so now, as the clean cars will likely never be priced this low again.

""[People who] are generally interested in them but haven't decided whether or not to make the leap into electricification, I would encourage those folks to at the very least go visit a dealer and get an in-person experience with the electric vehicles,"" Gruber said. ""Take advantage of this tax credit while it is here.""",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/LGzuRVfdZIMIKPG9s2FlJqnA3LU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-651424159-95b5b24dabe64beda12ab14a8ada0c6e.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:17:05.195711

However, Chinese companies seem poised to catapult further ahead based on recent announcements by CATL and BYD.
How Chinese Companies Got So Far Ahead Several factors have enabled Chinese OEMs to gain a competitive edge.
The first is a multi-year push by China into Mexico - albeit no Chinese EV companies currently produce vehicles in Mexico.
There are some exceptions, such as Ford’s licensing of battery production technology from China’s CATL for its battery production facility in Michigan.","The Canadian government has identified decarbonizing the transportation sector as one of the key levers for reducing emissions economy-wide. In 2023, the Trudeau government implemented regulations that would have required zero-emission vehicles to comprise 20% of light-duty vehicle sales in 2026, with the target rising to 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. However, Prime Minister Carney recently announced the suspension of the 2026 sales target as electric vehicle (EV) sales have slowed sharply in 2025, putting the target virtually out of reach for an auto sector that is already struggling to adapt to the U.S. trade war (chart 1). In the first quarter of the year, battery and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles comprised 8.7% of new vehicle registrations, down from nearly 15% in 2024. The slowdown in EV sales momentum was driven in part by the drying up of federal and provincial consumer subsidies in 2025. Additionally, EV prices remain elevated relative to comparable internal combustion models, with the added disadvantage of consumer concerns regarding insufficient charging infrastructure. In recognition of the role affordability plays in EV adoption and achieving the larger goal of decarbonizing the transportation sector, the government has tasked itself with finding ways to bring more affordable EVs into the Canadian market.

To some degree, the challenges related to domestic prices and the charging infrastructure reflects a strategic choice the government made to confront perceptions of “dumping” into the Canadian market from China’s EV overcapacity, which was a byproduct of nearly two decades of significant subsidization of their industry to the tune of about US$230 billion1. This risked displacing domestic production through an unfair advantage, resulting in a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs last year. However, in doing so, Canada has inadvertently curtailed the adoption of the most advanced battery technology on the market. This risks throwing the baby out with the bath water.

Policies should be more strategically designed rather than a blanket approach. There are opportunities to enhance the domestic EV industry to improve the rate of adoption with a lower cost structure and enhanced technology while also generating domestic jobs. Partnering with China’s leading companies, if managed strategically and pragmatically, could vastly enhance Canada’s EV ecosystem and bolster the domestic industry.

How Do Global EV Technologies Compare?

Much has been written about the relative technological advantage of Chinese EV technology relative to that in North America and Europe. The technology gap is to be expected given that China began fostering this advantage nearly 20 years ago with hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to aid the sector2. However, defining this gap in more definitive terms is required to assess relative differences and the feasibility for traditional automakers to catch up.

The first consideration is how far EVs can travel on a single charge. On this front, the differences are not material between Western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their Chinese counterparts (chart 2). For example, the driving range of the different trims of the 2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E is between 380-515 km versus 420-530 km for BYD SUVs sold in the E.U. Moreover, these distances are already comparable to the mileage one would get from a full tank on a gasoline SUV and are more than sufficient for daily commuting for most people. EV range generally increases with the energy capacity of a battery, but larger batteries also cost more. OEMs typically balance the range and cost tradeoffs by offering different trims of the same model that have different battery sizes/range and, by extension, price.

When it comes to consumer concerns on charging time, the current best-in-class models offered by some Chinese OEMs, such as Li Auto, are slightly ahead of the top-rated offerings from western OEMs like Mercedes-Benz and Lucid (chart 3). However, Chinese companies seem poised to catapult further ahead based on recent announcements by CATL and BYD. Both noted new battery technologies that can add 520 km and 400 km of range, respectively, in 5 minutes of charging. This would be comparable to the time it takes to fill a tank of gasoline for a similar range. This is an exciting development for EV innovation, but it will take time for companies to develop vehicles that are compatible with this new technology along with compatible charging infrastructure. Additionally, electricity grid upgrades will be necessary to enable the safe accommodation of the load demand from these ultrafast chargers to avoid straining the grid. To contextualize this, the new BYD 400km/5min Super e-Platform has a maximum charging power of 1 megawatt (MW), which means the power demand of charging just 500 vehicles simultaneously would be equivalent to about 10% of Toronto’s peak demand!

The last, and most consequential, consideration is the cost of the vehicle. Once again, Chinese OEMs are miles ahead of everyone in offering affordable models in the domestic Chinese market that in some cases, are cheaper than comparable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles (chart 4). According to data from the International Energy Agency, electric SUVs were only 2% more expensive than ICE SUVs in 2024 in China. Average electric car prices had fallen below those of conventional cars, as of 2023. In contrast, electric SUVs had a price premium of 26% in the U.S. and 20% in Germany while cars had a 21% and 38% premium in the U.S. and Europe, respectively.

Although Chinese EV manufacturers selling in overseas markets offer prices that are competitive, they are not the exceedingly low (US$10-20k) prices that are offered domestically in China. For example, the BYD Atto 3 Comfort model costs more than twice as much in Germany as it does in China.3 In part this is because when these vehicles are exported, they face higher costs related to shipping and logistics, tariffs, and vehicle specifications that conform with local standards. However, Chinese OEMs also charge higher prices net of these considerations to capitalize on stronger profit margins, in part to offset the lower profits earned in their competitive domestic market.

How Chinese Companies Got So Far Ahead

Several factors have enabled Chinese OEMs to gain a competitive edge. First, China’s EV industry has benefited from nearly two decades of production and consumer subsidies which have not only helped the industry to develop economies of scale but have also led to a battery manufacturing overcapacity. This overcapacity has driven down battery prices in China4, resulting in the low-cost EV models offered today.

Secondly, Chinese companies largely specialize in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, while in Western countries, nickel, manganese and cobalt-based (NMC) batteries are more common. While NMC batteries have higher energy density (energy capacity per unit of weight) and perform better in cold temperatures, LFP batteries are less costly since iron is more abundant and cheaper than nickel and cobalt. One estimate suggests the cost of production could be 35% lower for LFP batteries relative to NMC batteries.5 Furthermore, LFP batteries are less prone to overheating, making them more compatible with fast charging, a feature that has helped Chinese companies make significant advancements in developing fast charging technologies.6

Third, vertical integration has enabled Chinese companies like BYD to have better control over supply chain costs in a way that many non-Chinese companies (barring a few like Tesla) do not. As an example, BYD, which started as a battery manufacturer, makes its own batteries and does so at a much lower cost than leading battery manufacturers such as LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI and Panasonic, which supply many western OEMs.7 This is a notable advantage as batteries comprise a large proportion of EV manufacturing costs. For EVs available in Canada, battery costs are estimated to be over a quarter of total vehicle production costs (chart 5).8

Narrowing the Gap

Given the head start in EV technology that China gave itself and the subsequent gap that prevails between Chinese and Western OEMs today, the question then turns to whether this gap can be narrowed. Over the past few years, governments in Western nations invested tens of billions of dollars into consumer and production subsidies. In turn, the gap was narrowing. However, many of these subsidies have been wound down globally and OEMs will have to compete more directly.

Currently, OEMs are focusing their efforts on the highest cost component of an EV, the battery. Companies such as GM and Ford are pivoting towards LFP batteries for new entry level models that are expected to have lower prices compared to most current models. In North America, LFP battery production is expected to increase over the next few years as the Ford plant in Michigan comes online in 2026. In Canada, the PowerCo (Volkswagen) plant in Ontario will produce LFP batteries along with other battery chemistries, with production beginning in 2027. As well, Ultium Cells (a GM and LG Energy Solution joint venture) recently announced plans to convert part of its battery cell manufacturing facility in Tennessee to producing LFP batteries, with production expected to start in 2027. Other Korean and Japanese battery manufacturers are also investing in LFP batteries and ramping up production globally.

In terms of reducing charging times, non-Chinese manufacturers have been investing heavily in R&D. For instance, Samsung SDI announced about a year ago that it was on track to introduce batteries that can add 300 km of range in 5 minutes by 2026.9 While that range is now eclipsed by BYD’s 400 km and CATL’s 520 km announcements from earlier this year, it is still a big improvement relative to the current state of technology and also highlights that notable technological progress is happening outside China.

As well, many OEMs are partnering with Chinese battery makers and automakers to benefit from the technological advancements. The level of partnership varies. For instance, GM is directly buying batteries from CATL while awaiting the start of production at its Tennessee plant, while Ford is licensing battery and manufacturing technology from CATL for its Michigan plant. Other western OEMs are pursuing collaboration with Chinese OEMs to develop low-cost EV models. For example, Stellantis has acquired a 20% stake in Leapmotor and the two companies have formed a joint venture that will sell and manufacture affordable EVs outside China. The partnership is mutually beneficial as Leapmotor can expand its global sales by benefiting from Stellantis’ brand recognition and deep distribution and service networks, while Stellantis can capitalize on Leapmotor’s cost-efficient high-tech EV products to reach its EV sales targets. These types of partnerships could also enable western OEMs to learn from the operational processes of their Chinese partners, which have yielded faster vehicle development times and lower capital costs.

Global Trade Tensions, Old and New

The relative lack of Chinese EVs on the road in North America and most of Europe has been a deliberate government policy choice, with most nations implementing tariffs to protect their domestic manufacturing base. Less than a year ago, the U.S. and Canada imposed 100% tariffs on imported Chinese EVs, while the E.U. imposed 17-35% tariffs on EV firms producing in China – Tesla received a lower 7.8% tariff from the E.U. on vehicles produced in China. These measures became necessary in the eyes of these nations. EV adoption rates soared during the post-pandemic period and Chinese EV companies, many of which having already established economies of scale domestically, began to explore export opportunities. Several nations, including the U.S. and Canada, had imposed restrictions on the eligibility of Chinese EVs for consumer subsidies in years prior, but decided to take more direct action.

In contrast, other nations including the U.K., Norway, Australia, and New Zealand have not implemented measures to restrict Chinese EVs. Prior to the implementation of tariffs, the EV market share accounted for by Chinese companies in Europe was comparable across countries (chart 6). In the Oceania region, China’s relatively higher share is likely owing to geographic proximity. Interestingly, the high and low end of the spectrum are found in North America, where China’s sky-high 70% share of the Mexican EV market sharply diverges from the 0% share in the U.S. and Canada. The juxtaposition is striking, but can largely be explained by two factors. The first is a multi-year push by China into Mexico - albeit no Chinese EV companies currently produce vehicles in Mexico. The second is the exclusion of Chinese EVs from consumer subsidies in Canada and the U.S.

Canada’s tariff on Chinese EVs was implemented 4 days after the U.S. tariff went into effect, with both nations citing the risks posed to the North American market by unfair competition. This was not surprising as the two markets are heavily integrated in both production and sales. Roughly 95% of Canadian motor vehicle and parts exports are sent to the U.S. every year, while roughly 40% of U.S. motor vehicle and parts exports are sent to Canada. The former of these two statistics is largely why unilateral policy decisions in relation to the automotive industry are challenging for Canada, at least in terms of production. Since most finished motor vehicles produced in Canada are sent to the U.S. (over 80%), it would be infeasible to produce vehicles that are essentially banned by the U.S. This is not solely in relation to U.S. tariffs. The U.S. also has regulations which restrict Chinese software from being used in vehicles sold in the country.10 This means that even if a Chinese EV company were to produce vehicles in Canada that met the domestic content requirements of the USMCA, it would still be banned in the U.S. if its software was Chinese in origin. While full-scale production of Chinese EVs in Canada is unlikely, there are still several areas where Canada can look to bolster its EV industry through potential partnerships with China.

Policy Considerations

Given the EV technology gaps that remain between China and other nations and China’s desire to expand globally, some form of partnership could aid Canada in improving its EV ecosystem. This is already taking place in the sourcing of EV batteries and battery materials, with most major automakers partnering in some capacity with Chinese firms on this front. However, to date, this has largely occurred through trade, rather than investment partnerships. There are some exceptions, such as Ford’s licensing of battery production technology from China’s CATL for its battery production facility in Michigan. This is the same facility which will be used to produce the batteries for Ford’s recently announced US$30,000 electric pick-up truck.11 The question for Canadian policymakers is whether there’s a path for partnerships of this nature within its borders to the benefit of domestic workers and facilities?

Doing so would provide automakers that produce in Canada with options for enhancing partnerships with Chinese EV companies in areas such as battery components, batteries, charging infrastructure, and even EV production. Examples could include licensing agreements for battery production technology, partnerships in charging infrastructure technology, battery chemistry research and development partnerships, or joint EV platform development. Any of these options in isolation could help domestic automakers to accelerate innovation, lower production costs, and enhance consumer product offerings. Simultaneously, it would likely help Canada return its EV adoption rate to an upward trajectory by overcoming persistent consumer concerns related to cost and range anxiety. Even if these partnerships only impact the margins of the EV ecosystem, Canada could still vastly improve its EV infrastructure, providing material benefits to its economy and ambitions for EV adoption.

American automakers are already pursuing aspects of these proposals domestically and internationally by partnering with Chinese EV companies, and Canada should not overlook similar opportunities to diversify its auto production supply chain while also offering better and less expensive technology in addition to more consumer choices.

Canada is currently caught in the middle of growing strains in trading relationships with both the U.S. and China. But a strategy to diversifying auto exposure and production should not ignore the benefits of partnerships with other countries, especially a market leader like China. Canada could also consider pursuing these objectives jointly with other nations, such as the E.U., to diversify risk further.

Bottom Line

At the end of the day, there is a growing consensus that Canada needs a new gameplan when it comes to global trade and domestic policy. The EV market is a prime example of an industry that Canada has inherent competitive advantages (i.e. abundant critical minerals suitable for both LFP and NMC batteries, affordable clean energy, EV and battery manufacturing capacity, government support, and a ready-made skilled labor force in manufacturing production). This could be enhanced by partnerships with established leaders in innovation in the industry. Pragmatism will remain as essential as ever. But ingenuity in the face of new challenges will be important as Canada explores ways to boost its economy and achieve decarbonization goals in a shifting global trade environment.",https://economics.td.com/folder/images/canada-electric-vehicle-strategy.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:17:09.267421

The two new gas plants are projected to be completed by 2031 and could be operational past 2070.

But environmental activists say the utility and local governments are now abandoning their greenhouse gas commitments in a proposed settlement before state regulators, in which the company seeks to build two more gas plants, extend the life of two coal plants and scrap a plan for a large battery storage facility — all part of Kentucky’s effort to attract and serve future data centers.

PPL Corporation, the parent company of Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities, announced its goal in 2021 to reduce its carbon emissions 70% from 2010 levels by 2035, then have an 80% reduction by 2040, and ultimately achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Lexington’s city council unanimously voted in 2023 to set their own community-wide net-zero carbon emissions goal for 2050, with the city unveiling more detailed plans for how to meet that goal this June.

A non-binding resolution passed in 2020 by Louisville Metro Council was even more ambitious, seeking 100% clean energy across the city by 2040 — in addition to 100% clean electricity for city government operations by 2030 and 100% clean energy for its vehicle fleet and heating and cooling systems by 2023.

Former Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer signed an executive order shortly before leaving office in 2022 that put the 2040 net-zero goal in place, with his eventual successor — current Mayor Craig Greenberg — pledging during his campaign that he was “wholly committed” to meeting that goal.

Critics now say that both the local governments and LG&E/KU are essentially abandoning these net-zero goals to address climate change in a proposal that is currently before the Kentucky Public Service Commission.

LG&E/KU sought permission from the PSC in February to spend $3.7 billion to build two new 645 megawatt natural gas power plants in Louisville and Mercer County, in addition to upgrades to extend the life a coal-fired plant in Carroll County and the construction of a 400 megawatt sustainable battery storage facility in Louisville. The utility laid out a case that the extra power generation was needed to meet an upward spike in forecasted demand, mostly from the energy-guzzling data centers they expected to locate in Kentucky because of new tax incentives.

On July 31, LG&E/KU announced that they had reached a proposed settlement in this case with the Kentucky attorney general, the Kentucky Coal Association and other business groups. In the stipulation, they modified the request by seeking to extend the life of an additional coal unit at Louisville’s Mill Creek plant that was set to be retired in 2027, as well scrapping plans to build the battery storage facility.

While not directly entering into the settlement like the attorney general’s office, representatives of Louisville and Lexington’s city governments did sign the agreement — stating that they take no position on the stipulation, but also pledging they “will not oppose it at the hearing” of the case before the PSC.

At the three-day hearing at the Public Service Commission headquarters in early August, both local governments stayed true to their words, as attorneys for both attended and did not weigh in or question witnesses.

That did not sit well with some in the audience who gave public comments against the LG&E/KU plan at the onset of the hearing, who said their pledge to not oppose a massive increase in fossil fuel emissions for many years to come amounted to tacit approval.

“I am also disappointed in my Metro Government, I’ll tell you,” said Kimberly Crum of Louisville. “(Greenberg) is laying down for this, and I’m disappointed in him.”

Sarah Lynn Cunningham of the Louisville Climate Action Network put her disappointment with Greenberg in more stark terms, noting that the new gas plants will likely have a life span of 40 to 50 years and stiff-arm efforts to build up Kentucky’s renewable energy portfolio.

“That was a deal with the devil, and the mayor went along with it,” Cunningham said. “We’ve got a mayor who’s saying ‘Okay, fine, bring us more fossil fuel power plants.’”

Asked by Kentucky Public Radio on the day the settlement was announced if Louisville’s agreement not to oppose it contradicted the city’s own net-zero carbon emissions goals, Greenberg spokesman Kevin Trager initially said via email he would respond later that day. Trager has still not responded in the following six weeks, despite numerous follow-up requests for comment over that period.

‘I call B.S.’ LG&E/KU extending reliance on fossil fuels

Outside the Public Service Commission office in Frankfort on the first day of the August hearing, consumer and environmental activists blasted several aspects of the LG&E/KU settlement.

In addition to fears that current ratepayers would bear the burden of paying for the new plants if new data centers did not actually materialize in Kentucky — or wind up using significantly less energy than the utility’s staggering projections — they said the proposal would double down on greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come.

Sam Avery of the Renewable Energy Alliance of Louisville said LG&E/KU wanted to spend billions of dollars “to build an enormous new obsolete climate busting fossil fuel infrastructure that will keep you and your families dependent into the second half of this century on obsolete energy sources that will ruin the climate of this earth for all living beings who live on the earth.”

Cunningham of Louisville Climate Action Network focused on the utility’s recent pledge to nearly end fossil fuel emissions in 25 years, saying the proposed build out would render that impossible.

“PPL, that owns LG&E and KU, said a few years back, 'we're going to be net-zero, no more greenhouse gas emissions after 2050,’” Cunningham said. “I call B.S. That isn't gonna happen when they do stuff like this.”

The energy generation of LG&E/KU is currently dominated by coal, but reliance on natural gas is on the rise. Power plants burning natural gas release about half the amount of carbon dioxide as coal-fired plants, but they also release significant amounts of methane, a potent, though shorter-lived greenhouse gas.

As of today, 84% of the utility’s power comes from burning coal, followed by gas at 15% and renewable energy at 1%. However, those percentages are projected to shift in the next few years, thanks to a request approved by the PSC in late 2023.

Under that PSC decision, LG&E was allowed to retire two coal units, replacing them with a new gas plant at Mill Creek in Louisville and several new solar and battery storage facilities. LG&E actually wanted to go further, but the PSC denied its request to shut down two additional coal units and build an additional gas plant — the one it now wants to build in Mercer County.

At the time of the PSC decision, LG&E estimated when these projects were complete that their energy mix would shift to 64% coal, 29% natural gas and 7% renewable energy.

Despite that shift, such an energy mix would still be well short of what would be needed to become net-zero by 2050 — and that’s before the current LG&E proposal to build two new gas plants, extend the life of two coal plants and scrap a battery storage plan. The two new gas plants are projected to be completed by 2031 and could be operational past 2070.

In the August hearing, PSC chair Angie Hatton asked Lonnie Bellar, a top executive at PPL, if the settlement to extend the life of an additional coal plant and strike the battery storage facility would change its 2050 net-zero goals.

“It potentially could,” Bellar answered. “We've stated publicly with respect to those goals, we reassess those at the end of the year. Part of that reason is to understand what the approvals are in this proceeding.”

Bellar noted that part of the settlement was an agreement that LG&E/KU conduct a request for proposal (RFP) on a new renewable energy and storage project by mid-2026, and “if we find cost-effective resources as part of that, we’ll make a filing for their approval with the commission by the end of 2028.”

But just because an RFP is conducted does not mean a project will come to fruition. LG&E issued an RFP for renewable energy projects in 2024, but chose not to pursue any of the submitted proposals.

Ken Shapero of the Louisville Climate Action Network said this aspect of the settlement is not reassuring, calling it “some vague promise that down the road there’ll be competitive bids on sustainable energy.”

‘This is not an optional goal’ Locals decry city leaders

When asked by Louisville Public Media during his 2022 campaign if he intended to fulfill then-Mayor Fischer’s 2040 community-wide net-zero goal, current Louisville Mayor Greenberg said he was all in.

“This is not an optional goal and I am wholly committed to meeting it by 2040 or sooner if possible,” Greenberg said. “We must work together to make Louisville a safer and healthier city.”

He also said the science is clear that “our climate is rapidly changing and that change is being driven by human activity, most notably the burning of fossil fuels.”

“There is near universal consensus that the time has come to begin winding down the use of fossil fuels, build a sustainable future based on renewable energy, and prepare for extreme weather pattern changes before it is too late,” Greenberg said.

While Greenberg’s administration agreed not to oppose LG&E/KU’s settlement in the PSC hearing, other Louisville elected officials showed up to the hearing to express their opposition.

Metro Councilwoman Tammy Hawkins, who represents the West End district where a massive 525-megawatt data center has been proposed, told the PSC commissioners they should not let LG&E/KU build the new gas plants — citing both the possibility of increased utility bills and environmental harms.

“Our climate and health demands that we choose energy sources that do not rely on fossil fuels,” Hawkins said. “Energy efficiency, solar and battery storage are all cheaper, safer and more reliable than natural gas.”

Metro Councilwoman Betsy Ruhe also spoke against the LG&E/KU plan, saying that renewable energy is cheaper than burning fossil fuels — counting both customer utility bills and the added costs of dealing with the effects of climate change.

“You can add all those climate impacts on here that are additionally going to cost us money,” Ruhe said. “We have higher storms. I hope you like the weather the last month or so where we went outside in the morning and it's like 78 degrees day after day after day. This is not going to get better. It is going to get worse.”

Last week, Mayor Greenberg dropped a plan to buy renewable energy certificates from a future solar energy project in western Kentucky — part of its effort to meet the city’s 2030 goal of powering city government operations with 100% clean electricity. The measure did not gain enough support among members of Metro Council to pass.

Environmental activists based in Lexington have also criticized its local government leaders for agreeing not to oppose the LG&E/KU settlement terms.

“This settlement, which commits Lexington to decades more of expensive fossil-based electricity generation, and fails to reduce demand with cost-saving options such as intensified energy efficiency programs, represents an abandonment of Lexington's net zero commitment and the needs of Lexington rate payers for affordable energy,” said Catherine Clement, a Lexington resident and member of Kentuckians For The Commonwealth, one of the groups intervening in the PSC case.

Spokespersons for Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton have not returned a request for comment.

In the August PSC hearing, Chairwoman Hatton questioned Bellar on how LG&E/KU weighs the climate goals of Louisville and Lexington when determining its operation plans. He answered that LG&E/KU offer green tariff programs where cities can pay into a renewable power agreement, but added that “you're correct in pointing out there's a natural tension there between the overall objective function that we operate off of and those individual goals.”

“And some states have green energy mandates,” Hatton added. “North Carolina has green energy mandates, but Kentucky doesn't. Maybe the opposite of that, in a lot of ways.”

“Correct,” Bellar answered. “We try to comply with all the directions of the legislature, the commission, and comply with all the environmental rules, and do that in the lowest reasonable cost.”

“So that sounds easy,” Hatton replied, sarcastically.

The Kentucky General Assembly is dominated by Republicans who are enthusiastic supporters of the state’s coal industry and skeptical of the importance or scientific reality of climate change. They recently passed legislation that makes it more difficult for utilities to retire coal plants.

Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear says he believes in the threat of climate change, but rarely mentions it unprompted in his press conferences and speeches. He touts an all-of-the-above energy approach for Kentucky.

Beshear appoints the three commissioners of the PSC, but they must be confirmed by a vote of the GOP-led Senate — which has several times declined to do so.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f4e2d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+1/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9c%2F08%2F9a78519844e1ae4fae94116c78c4%2Fdji-fly-20250905-143040-474-1757097129432-photo-optimized-2.JPG,N,,2025-09-08 12:23:52.473347

What Happens Next Whether Trump makes further statements or policies on wind energy remains to be seen.","President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of windmills, claimed in a post on Truth Social that the renewable energy source increases the cost of energy and is killing birds and the ""bad"" politicians who support it.

Why It Matters

Trump has long been an opponent of wind turbines. He campaigned on expanding fossil fuels for American energy and paused federal wind permits while ending tax credits that had supported renewable developments in the U.S.

What To Know

""Amazing phenomenon — Any Country that relies on Windmills is DEAD,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday afternoon. ""Their Energy Costs have gone through the roof, and their populations are angry. Windmills aren't only killing the birds, they're 'killing' lots of bad politicians who are losing their jobs because of them!""

After returning to office in January, Trump declared a national energy emergency and signed an executive order stating that federal wind leasing programs suffered from ""various alleged legal deficiencies.""

The order said that these could result in ""negative impacts on navigational safety interests, transportation interests, national security interests, commercial interests, and marine mammals.""

In August, the Department of Commerce announced it would be expanding the scope of the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum to include 407 new product categories, including wind turbines and their ""parts and components.""

In 2023, Trump also falsely claimed at a South Carolina rally that wind turbines had killed a large number of bald eagles.

""Wind turbine collisions kill way less birds in the U.S. than domestic cats or building collisions,"" Elie Bou-Zeid, a professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Princeton University, told Newsweek. ""If he is worried about birds, he should let more Haitian immigrants into the U.S., since he says they eat the cats and the dogs.""

Bou-Zeid continued: ""Wind turbines produce the cheapest electricity in the U.S. of any source, 25 percent cheaper than combined cycle gas, which is the cheapest source of electricity from fossil fuel. So, Trump is hallucinating facts and vomiting them on social media, as usual.""

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump on Truth Social in August: ""Any State that has built and relied on WINDMILLS and SOLAR for power are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS.""

Trump, at a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland in July: ""Wind is the most expensive form of energy. And it destroys the beauty of your fields and your plains and your waterways. And look, look out there—there's no windmills. But if you look in another direction, you see windmills. If, when we go to Aberdeen, you'll see some of the ugliest windmills you've ever seen. They're the height of a 50-story building. And you can take a thousand times more energy out of a hole in the ground...It's called oil and gas.""

What Happens Next

Final Thoughts GM and Ford, with their deep gas and hybrid portfolios, are among the winners from the EV policy changes.","U.S. President Donald Trump’s unfriendly stance on electric vehicles (EVs) is set to reshape the auto industry. His “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in July, will end the federal EV tax credits on Sept. 30.

Until then, eligible buyers can still knock $7,500 off the sticker price—on top of other incentives— but once the deadline is here, the perk disappears. Additionally, the bill has scrapped the penalties for automakers who fail to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.

Just a few years ago, under the Biden administration, automakers were doubling down on EVs. Tax breaks, supportive policies and stricter emissions rules pushed companies to speed up their e-mobility efforts.

But things have changed now. Trump’s rollback of incentives and regulations, along with new tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, is changing the economics of EVs in the United States. The shift is forcing legacy automakers to rethink their electrification plans.

Detroit’s Legacy Carmakers Welcome the Shift

For traditional automakers like General Motors GM and Ford F, the policy change comes as a financial breather. Bloomberg recently reported that this rollback could unlock billions of dollars for Detroit carmakers to reinvest in gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicles.

Ford CEO Jim Farley even called the policy shift a “multibillion-dollar opportunity” for its gas and hybrid business. GM CFO Paul Jacobson echoed the sentiment, saying the removal of fines will start saving the company money as early as 2026.

The reason is simple— without fuel economy fines, Ford and General Motors no longer need to buy regulatory credits from EV-only players. GM has spent $3.5 billion on credits since 2022, while Ford has cut $1.5 billion in similar purchases this year. They can now redirect the money into profitable gas-powered trucks and SUVs.

GM and F currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

GM and Ford Scale Back EV Ambitions

This policy reset is showing up in production plans. GM recently announced it will temporarily cut one shift each for the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ between Sept. 2 and Oct. 6. While the Silverado EV and Sierra EV pickups remain in production, GM has delayed its second electric truck plant and Buick’s first EV by six months. Instead, the automaker revealed $4 billion in spending for mostly gasoline-powered vehicles—clear evidence it’s not betting everything on EVs anymore.

Ford is making similar adjustments. The company cut its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn—where the F-150 Lightning is built—to a single shift. It also scrapped plans for an all-electric three-row SUV in Ontario. Instead, Ford is leaning into hybrids, especially in its best-selling truck lineup. Farley has said the Ford Blue division, which builds gas and hybrid vehicles, had been shouldering most of the compliance burden under stricter rules. With Trump’s rollback, that division stands to benefit the most. In fact, Ford is retooling its Oakville plant to make Super Duty F-Series pickups starting next year, reversing its earlier plan to build EVs there.

While Detroit’s legacy automakers view the rollback as a relief, the story looks very different for pure play EV companies like Tesla TSLA, Lucid Group LCID and Rivian Automotive RIVN, which relied heavily on incentives and credits to fuel demand and profits.

EV Pure Plays Lose a Safety Net

Tesla, Rivian and Lucid are losing a major source of revenues. That’s because Trump’s rollback not only ends consumer tax credits but also kills the market for regulatory credits.

Under the old rules, automakers that fell short of fuel-economy targets had to either pay fines or buy credits from companies that exceeded the standards—mostly EV makers. Tesla, Rivian and Lucid were prime beneficiaries of this system. Now that the fines are gone, so is the need for credits. And the impact is beginning to show.

Rivian said regulatory credits made up 6.5% of its total revenues in the first half of 2025, but it doesn’t expect any credit sales for the rest of the year. Last year, Rivian earned more than $400 million from these sales. Losing that cushion makes its path to profitability even steeper.

Lucid is facing a similar squeeze. It is already battling demand and profitability challenges, so the loss of this income stream just adds to the hurdles.

Tesla, meanwhile, is taking the biggest hit in absolute dollars. Since 2019, Tesla has generated over $10.6 billion from credit sales—profits that often made the difference during lean quarters. In the last reported quarter alone, Tesla booked $439 million from credits. While that sounds strong, it’s down nearly 50% from the $890 million it earned a year earlier. The decline has been steady, quarter after quarter, and Trump’s rollback threatens to accelerate the slide.

Final Thoughts

GM and Ford, with their deep gas and hybrid portfolios, are among the winners from the EV policy changes. They would gain flexibility, save billions in compliance costs, and push forward with vehicles that still deliver strong margins.

On the losing side are Rivian and Lucid, whose business models counted on credit revenues to partially offset losses from selling EVs. Without that extra income, their road to profitability looks longer and riskier. Tesla, too, faces margin pressure as one of its reliable profit levers disappears.

The government will conduct a 60-day review of its EV mandate policy and is waiving the requirement that 20 percent of all new car sales be ZEVs for 2026.

Data published by Transport Canada shows that ZEVs had a 13.7 percent market share in July 2024. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s mandate required at least 20 percent of all light-duty vehicle sales in Canada to be ZEVs by 2026. This requirement increases to 60 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2035.

Although EV demand is lagging behind the goal of 20 percent market share, and Canada ended its federal EV tax credit early this year, Prime Minister Mark Carney is blaming the U.S. for the change in policy. “We have an auto sector which, because of the massive change in U.S. policy, is under extreme pressure. We recognize that,” Carney said at a news conference. “They’ve got enough on their plate right now. So we’re taking [the EV mandate] off.”

Automakers and opponents of Canada’s Liberal Party have opposed the EV mandate as an unrealistic burden on the auto sector. “Now, businesses who would otherwise consider investing in automaking here in Canada will have to put that investment on hold while Mark Carney dithers for another year,” Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre told the press. He called Carney’s move a “clumsy retreat.”

Canada’s federal EV tax credit of up to CA$5,000 ended in January because the program ran out of money. Similarly, several provincial tax credits for EVs dried up this year.

The mirrors tilt to varying degrees throughout the day, tracking the sunrays and projecting them onto a tower. The tower houses a receiver that absorbs intense heat, boils water and produces high-pressure steam. This is then converted into 50 megawatts of electricity — enough to power over 40,000 households for 24 hours.

The KHI Solar One project is one of many looking to add renewable energy to South Africa’s power grid, which is heavily reliant on coal-fired power stations.

However, as hundreds of delegates prepare to gather in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa for the Africa Climate Summit this week, it’s clear that many more such projects are needed to bring electricity to millions of people on the continent who need it and to fight the impacts of climate change.

Africa’s energy needs

According to the International Energy Agency, about 600 million people on a continent of some 1.5 billion live without electricity, leaving children without lights to study at night and homes without power for appliances.

The World Bank estimates that Central and West Africa have some of the world’s lowest electrification rates. In West Africa, where 220 million people have no electricity, the electrification rate is as low as 8%.

The lack of electricity also limits the continent’s access to quality health care, education and economic growth brought about by a sufficient and uninterrupted power supply.

The continent’s embracing of renewable energy has been slow when compared to more developed economies like China, European countries and the U.S., which account for 80% of renewable power capacity installed worldwide.

Only 1.5% of installed renewable power capacity is in Africa.

Renewable energy potential in Africa

According to a report by the United Nations released in July, Africa has 60% of the world’s best solar resources with the continent’s deserts and warm climate creating massive potential for solar projects.

Despite this, Africa received just 2% of global clean energy investments in 2024.

At a climate summit in January this year, African leaders committed to bringing renewable energy capacity in Africa to 300 gigawatts by 2030. That amount of power equals the output of about 114 large power stations — enough to power a large city or a small country. Meanwhile, the International Renewable Energy Agency projects that 90% of Africa’s power could be generated from renewables including solar by 2050.

This includes other renewable energy sources besides solar, with countries like South Africa opting for an energy mix that includes hydropower and wind energy.

China’s rising solar exports to Africa

Some recent analysis of Chinese export data has shown that exports of solar panels to Africa have increased significantly over the last 12 months.

A report by energy think tank Ember notes that imports from China rose 60% in the last year to 15,032 megawatts, with 20 African countries setting a record for imports of solar panels in a 12-month period.

While the surge in solar panels had previously been buoyed by imports by South Africa, which went through years of power blackouts due to a lengthy electricity crisis, imports of solar panels from outside of South Africa tripled in the last 12 months.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/c4b320d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6551x3685+0+341/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F14%2F17%2Fd1bda29bb0e9cb5056e889fc4885%2Fbe9be53f1f534b64bcc8c476a06f09b3,N,,2025-09-08 13:09:13.731596

The ninth annual event celebrates innovation in clean energy, encompassing technologies such as solar, wind, storage, wave, hydropower, geothermal, nuclear, waste-to-energy, and natural gas. The event highlights the value of clean energy for promoting economic growth, creating jobs, achieving energy independence, and reducing energy bills.

Every year, the event draws a nationwide audience, particularly for its Policymakers Symposium, during which business and political leaders discuss emerging and pressing energy topics. “Since its beginning, the NCEW Policymakers Symposium has served as a platform for leaders to bring smart, commonsense clean energy ideas to the table, and we’re thrilled to see those ideas come to life again this year,” reflected Heather Reams, NCEW founder and chair, as well as Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) president and CEO. “Together, with the top voices in energy, we will discuss how America can lead the world in clean energy production while ensuring our economy and national security are at the forefront. We look forward to hosting these exciting conversations that will shape our energy future.”

The energy and technology industries are consistently well-represented at NCEW. 2024’s event, in particular, drew 56 industry experts. This year, some of the industry speakers include representatives from groups like CRES, the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), the Conservative Energy Network (CEN), the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and the National Hydropower Association (NHA).

Business leaders from companies like auto industry leader Ford Motor Company, utility-scale solar and storage company Avantus, storage company Hydrostor, renewable fuel companies Gevo and Growth Energy, fusion company Helion Energy, and gas leaders ExxonMobil Upstream Company and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) will also be in attendance.

Policymakers from both political parties are heavily involved in National Clean Energy Week. As NCEW says on its website, “National Clean Energy Week is dedicated to bipartisanship. Together, we harness the power of free market and government collaboration to create jobs, expand our economy, strengthen America’s national security and preserve our environment.”

Last year, seven administrative officials and 22 policymakers participated. Among the most prominent names were three Republican governors – Brian Kemp (R-GA), Bill Lee (R-TN), and Brad Little (R-ID). Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) were both in attendance. Members of the House included Reps. John Curtis (R-UT), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), Jenn Kiggans (R-VA), Marc Veasey (D-TX), Susie Lee (D-NV), and Scott Peters (D-CA), all of whom will return this year, including Sen. John Curtis in his new position at the U.S. Senate.

On September 17, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Reps. Veasey (D-TX) and Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ) will kick off the Policymaker Symposium with their remarks. Rep. Lee (D-NV) and Rep. Kiggans (R-VA) will follow later in the morning, with Rep. Peters (D-CA) trailing in the afternoon. On the second day of the symposium, Sen. Curtis (R-UT) and Rep. Miller-Meeks (R-IA) will deliver their remarks, followed by Chairman Tim Walberg (R-MI) and Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA).

Beyond the keynote remarks, the two-day Policymakers Symposium will feature panels on a variety of pressing topics and issues:

The recent changes to and the future of energy and climate tax policy;

How investments in clean energy manufacturing can create jobs, speed up workforce development processes, and ultimately contribute to economic growth;

How domestic energy products can compete against the likes of Chinese counterparts on the world stage;

How the ethanol industry is transforming both the biofuel sector and rural communities in the Midwest;

How permitting reform can unlock America’s energy potential, simultaneously promoting energy and national security;

How domestic innovation can continue to deliver new technologies and projects, generating energy that is affordable and reliable;

How artificial intelligence is changing the energy sector, with improvements to efficiency, forecasting, and grid performance;

How to decide where to invest in a continually evolving energy market, which presents multiple challenges and opportunities;

The future of nuclear energy in America, with development possible everywhere from decommissioned plants to advanced, small nuclear reactors;

How offshore wind can contribute to filling domestic energy demand if it can overcome challenges, including permitting and leasing;

How various sectors, including policy, industry, finance, and government, can help prepare and grow energy infrastructure to meet expanding energy needs; and,

The importance of mining, processing, and recycling domestic critical minerals, while reducing reliance on foreign supply chains.

There will also be a VIP Reception and Dinner and a Young Professionals Happy Hour to provide attendees with additional opportunities to connect, learn, and network.

Much of National Clean Energy Week’s impact is felt and seen outside of the in-person gathering in Washington, D.C. Overall, last year’s NCEW generated 79 media mentions and more than 4 million social media impressions. 18 U.S. Senators and 50 U.S. Representatives engaged with NCEW content, and sixty-two governors and mayors issued proclamations recognizing Clean Energy Week.

This year, the first local leaders to issue proclamations recognizing Clean Energy Week included Gov. Henry McMaster (R-SC), Gov. Bill Lee (R-TN), Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM), Gov. Tate Reeves (R-MS), and Mayor Muriel Bowser (D-DC). Since then, Gov. Brad Little (R-ID), Gov. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND), Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH), Gov. Tina Kotek (D-OR), Gov. Larry Rhoden (R-SD), and Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) have joined them.

Reams noted, “This isn’t a red or blue issue—it’s a red, white and blue issue that transcends party lines. These proclamations underscore the desire states have to enhance innovation, create and retain jobs within their local economies, strengthen America’s global competitiveness and ensure our clean energy sector is not only expanded and protected, but empowered to tackle the challenges of tomorrow.”

Additionally, NCEW encourages other organizations to celebrate in their own communities by hosting their own Clean Energy Week events, such as a Policymakers Forum watch party, a local panel discussion, or a reception or networking event. NCEW will provide materials, including a communications guide, a social media toolkit, and an event kit featuring swag such as stickers, koozies, and posters, to make each of these events as successful as possible. They will also be listed as official participating organizations, highlighted on the NCEW calendar and social media channels. For example, the Puerto Rico Energy Forum is hosting a satellite event that will feature panels, workshops, and networking events.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NCEW-Policymaker-Symposium-2024TK022748-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 14:04:58.946244

But some say it's not enough,Not Available,,,,,https://www.kcur.org/environment-agriculture/2025-09-08/midwest-cities-clean-up-forever-chemicals-costs-drinking-water,"The class action settlements with companies including 3M, DuPont and Tyco includes hundreds of water systems across the country.
Burden of removing PFAS from drinking water PFAS are man-made chemicals that don’t break down and build up in the environment and the body.
He said public water systems are the ones primarily responsible for delivering safe drinking water to their communities.
“PFAS tends to pass through our water treatment processes, unless you upgrade them to a whole new level of engineering technology,” Strifling said.
Chemical companies face litigation Public water systems have taken PFAS manufacturers to court after detecting forever chemicals in their water systems, reaching nationwide class action settlements with the companies totaling more than $12 billion.","The city of Eau Claire in western Wisconsin had to shut down nearly half of its wells in 2021 after finding “forever chemicals” in its water supply.

The wells are close to the Chippewa Valley Regional Airport, where fire fighting foams containing PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, had been used, according to the city.

Now, Eau Claire is building a $20 million filtration facility to address the issue, which it expects to open next year.

Part of the funding for that project will come from $12 million in settlements the city reached with PFAS manufacturers in 2023. But the settlement dollars the city expects to receive won’t cover the full project, said City Attorney Steve Nick.

“I would like to have seen more funds come in from this settlement, but it's still a substantial settlement,” he said. “The nature of compromise is usually you don't get everything you're looking for.”

Cities across the Midwest and Great Plains are in line for millions of settlement dollars meant to help clean up PFAS from their water supplies. The class action settlements with companies including 3M, DuPont and Tyco includes hundreds of water systems across the country.

Some cities have started to receive payments already, such as Eau Claire and West Des Moines, Iowa. Others are filing new lawsuits to help pay for removal efforts.

But the settlement dollars often fall short of the costs to eliminate the chemicals, city leaders say. And sometimes that means cities are relying on customers to cover the gaps.

Burden of removing PFAS from drinking water

PFAS are man-made chemicals that don’t break down and build up in the environment and the body. They increase risks of health problems like cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dave Strifling, director of the Water Law & Policy Initiative at Marquette University Law School, said the primary way people ingest PFAS is through drinking water. He said public water systems are the ones primarily responsible for delivering safe drinking water to their communities.

“PFAS tends to pass through our water treatment processes, unless you upgrade them to a whole new level of engineering technology,” Strifling said.

Kyle Burton is the field operations director for the drinking and groundwater program at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He said there are some proven treatment techniques to remove PFAS from drinking water, but they’re often “very costly.”

“Treatment systems for large communities can be in the tens of millions of dollars to install,” he said.

And the communities facing those high costs aren’t responsible for the pollution they’re fighting to keep out of the drinking water, said Christina Murphy, general manager of West Des Moines Water Works.

“It's absolutely frustrating,” she said. “We're not responsible for the contamination, yet we're required to meet the drinking water standards.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will set new drinking water limits for two widely studied PFAS chemicals at 4 parts per trillion, giving water systems until 2031 to comply. The original deadline was 2029, and had previously planned to set limits for four more chemicals.

Last year, the EPA estimated that between 6% and 10% of the 66,000 public water systems subject to the rule would have to take action to meet the standards.

Chemical companies face litigation

Public water systems have taken PFAS manufacturers to court after detecting forever chemicals in their water systems, reaching nationwide class action settlements with the companies totaling more than $12 billion.

The largest is with 3M, which agreed to pay between $10.3 and $12.5 billion. DuPont and its spinoffs, Tyco Fire Products and BASF contributed smaller amounts.

In most cases, Strifling said the goal is to use the settlement funds to refit water treatment plants with new PFAS removal technologies.

In a statement, a Tyco spokesperson said the company’s $750 million settlement agreement with public water systems has been approved by a court and an independent settlement administrator is processing claims and will make payments to water systems that were approved to receive funds.

“Tyco has fully funded the settlement and the court has dismissed the relevant cases against Tyco,” the spokesperson said. “Tyco resolved these cases to avoid the expense and uncertainty of litigation, and it does not constitute an admission of liability.”

Beyond the cases that have already settled, there are still active lawsuits against manufacturers of firefighting foam that contain PFAS. As of Sept. 2, there were more than 12,000 claims in a federal lawsuit against 3M and other companies, according to King Law, a law firm based in Rochester, New York.

In Missouri, Kansas City announced last month that it would file a lawsuit seeking damages related to environmental contamination caused by PFAS chemicals found in firefighting foam used at municipal sites.

“Kansas City seeks to ensure that the expenses of PFAS removal do not fall on taxpayers or the travelling public, but instead on the companies that profited while hiding the known dangers of PFAS,” a city spokesperson wrote in a statement.

Settlement dollars often aren’t enough

In Iowa, Des Moines Water Works has received notice that it will be awarded $9.7 million from a PFAS settlement with 3M, which is lower than initial estimates, according to Amy Kahler, CEO and general manager of Des Moines Water Works.

“These funds will help us continue investing in safe, clean water for the people of Des Moines while ensuring that those responsible for contamination contribute to the solution,” Kahler said in a statement.

Meanwhile, West Des Moines Water Works expects to receive a little more than $3 million across settlements with several PFAS manufacturers, according to Murphy.

Murphy said West Des Moines joined the class action lawsuit to recoup costs of either drilling more wells or investing in treatment systems. She said the water system has detected PFAS in a number of its shallow wells and is trying to identify new wells that are not contaminated.

“Unfortunately, that's proving to be a challenge,” Murphy said. “We've kind of struck out twice on trying to find wells that are PFAS-free.”

If the water system cannot find new PFAS-free water sources, she said it will have to “go back to the drawing board” and look at potential treatment options, “which is certainly going to cost a lot more money.”

She said the roughly $3 million in settlement funds will help West Des Moines drill some wells, but it’s not going to be much help if the utility has to look at treatment options.

“That money will be dedicated to any source water improvements, or even treatment improvements, if that's where we need to go,” she said. “But it will not fund 100% of the costs that we’re going to incur here.”

Some communities opt out

In Texas, Fort Worth and Dallas rejected two class action settlements in 2023 with 3M and DuPont and water systems across the country. Viewing the settlements as “inadequate,” the two cities opted out to pursue their own lawsuits against the chemical manufacturers, according to the Texas Tribune.

Hastings, Minnesota, where PFAS was present in all six city wells, also chose to opt out of nationwide settlements with 3M and DuPont.

Hastings Public Works Director Ryan Stempski said the city opted out because it calculated that it would receive $3 million to $4 million from the settlement, which is a “drop in the bucket” compared to the nearly $69 million in costs the city faces to build three PFAS treatment plants.

Instead, Hastings is trying to use settlement funds from a lawsuit Minnesota settled with 3M in 2018 for $850 million. So far, Stempski says Hastings has secured about $14 million after tying PFAS in one of its six wells to a nearby 3M plant, and it’s working with the state to connect the others.

“We haven't crossed over that hump yet,” he said. “Those are the studies going on currently. But we believe that through continuous efforts … that we can get to those interconnectivities and continue to get more funds for Hastings.”

The city hopes to get all three treatment plants up and running by 2029. Stempski says the first plant is expected to begin construction this month.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4737347/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+450/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F83%2Fc2%2Fa7b0ffde478fb051c239ed19e41a%2Feau-claire-water-tower.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:20:30.911447

BMW and Mercedes-Benz unveiled new models in Munich in recent days, positioning themselves in the fast-growing category led by Tesla’s Model Y.

BMW presented the iX3 while Mercedes launched an electric version of its GLC model. Both feature long driving ranges and AI assistants. Testing showed the iX3 can travel up to 497 miles on a charge while the GLC reaches 457 miles. Tesla’s updated Model Y long-range version, meanwhile, only hits 387 miles.

BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse presented the new car on Friday, calling it a “once-in-a-lifetime moment” for his team. “When else do you get to reimagine a brand like BMW from the ground up?” he asked.

The launches come as Tesla is losing ground in its core U.S. market. The market share of its EV sales fell to 38% in August, the lowest level since 2017, according to research firm Cox Automotive.

The company’s share dropped from nearly 49% in June to 42% in July, the sharpest decline in more than two years. Tesla once commanded more than 80% of the U.S. EV market.

Sales of electric cars in the U.S. grew more than 24% in July as buyers rushed to benefit from federal tax credits and discounts. Tesla’s sales increased by 7% in that period, but competitors grew faster. In Europe, Tesla deliveries have declined by about one-third this year.

""I know they're positioning themselves as a robotics, AI company. But when you're a car company, when you don't have new products, your share will start to decline,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s director of industry insights, per Reuters.

""These legacy manufacturers are all benefiting from this sense of urgency, and they're able to have attractive offerings for their vehicles - and it's working,"" Valdez Streaty added.

Chinese manufacturers are also expanding in Europe with lower-priced SUVs that emphasize digital features. XPeng recently began selling its G6 model in Germany for about $55,800.

Meanwhile, industry giant BYD has overtaken Tesla’s sales in Europe this year, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. In July, Tesla’s sales in the region fell 40% year-over-year to 8,837 vehicles, while BYD’s rose 225% to 13,503.

The German automakers are also working with U.S. tech firms to upgrade digital capabilities. BMW is working with Qualcomm, while Mercedes has partnered with Nvidia, and Google and OpenAI are supplying the AI for Mercedes’ virtual assistant.

Analysts say the latest BMW and Mercedes launches mark one of the biggest efforts yet by traditional car makers to compete directly with Tesla on technology as well as performance.

But Steve Fowler, an industry consultant and car reviewer told the Wall Street Journal: “Have I seen anything in the Neue Klasse or the new Mercedes models that will make the Chinese scared? No.”

The iX3 will cost about $80,000 in Germany, according to BMW, compared with Tesla’s Model Y which starts at around $60,000 for the long-range model.

These approvals were issued by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC).

The approved projects include a 200MW facility in Coffee County with a 30-year PPA, a 260MW facility in Mitchell County with a 25-year PPA, and a 225MW facility in Laurens County with a 20-year PPA.

They also include a 183MW facility with 91.5MW battery storage in Wilkinson County and a 200MW facility in Jefferson County. Both projects come with a 20-year PPA.

These projects will support the company’s Clean and Renewable Energy Subscription (CARES) 2023 programme.

They will be developed and maintained by third-party companies that bid in the CARES 2023 request for proposal (RfP), approved in the 2022 integrated resource plan (IRP) final order.

Georgia Power’s 2025 IRP, sanctioned in July, outlines up to 4GW in renewable energy procurement by 2035.

The company will initially focus on securing 1.1GW through utility-scale and distributed generation procurements.

The company plans to issue RfPs in 2026 for these additions, aiming to boost its renewable resource capacity to roughly 11,000MW by 2035.

Georgia Power director of renewable development Wilson Mallard said: “Renewable RfPs, such as the CARES 2023 RfP, are designed to procure valuable renewable energy that helps to diversify Georgia Power’s generation mix and increase reliability. Our planning models project that these resources will deliver benefits to customers long-term.

“The five projects we selected are economical and we expect they will provide energy and capacity benefits to the system and the most value for all Georgia Power customers.”

Released following approval in the 2022 IRP final order, the CARES 2025 RfP had set an August deadline for bid submissions.

Participants in this year’s CARES RfP were invited to propose utility-scale solar or solar plus storage projects, aiming to fulfil a quota of up to 2GW of utility-scale solar, which encompasses any outstanding capacity from the previous CARES 2023 RfP programme.

These projects are anticipated to be operational as early as 2028.

This May, Georgia Power initiated construction on new battery energy storage systems (BESSs) across Georgia, totalling 765MW.

These systems, endorsed by the PSC through the IRP, will offer rapidly dispatchable power, building on the Mossy Branch BESS facility that commenced operations in 2024.",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/09/shutterstock_2550494489.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 13:09:19.389873
,American Energy,2025-09-08 14:59:27+00:00,Roll Call,White House embraces density concept in developing energy policy - Roll Call,Kelly Livingston,,,,,https://rollcall.com/2025/09/08/white-house-embraces-density-concept-in-developing-energy-policy/,"Density is a driving force in the administration’s energy decisions right now, a senior official in the Department of Energy’s Office of Policy said last week.
The official spoke on background for the purposes of engaging in a more candid discussion of the administration’s energy policies.
Energy density is the amount of energy stored in a system by volume or mass.
Now, the Trump administration has gutted many Biden-era grants and regulations, saying instead it will favor energy projects with greater energy and capacity density.
“If you look at fuel sources through the lens of capacity density and energy density and capacity factor, by default, some sources will be more attractive than others,” the senior DOE official said.","As the federal government reimagines American energy policy this year, support for projects hinges on a new metric — density.

The concept of density in energy production echoes throughout recent regulatory changes and funding rescissions across the Trump administration, leading to a demonstrably increased federal preference for fossil fuels and nuclear power over renewable generation sources such as wind and solar.

Broadly speaking, relying on density metrics prioritizes greater energy outputs for less investment of money and land. Density is a driving force in the administration’s energy decisions right now, a senior official in the Department of Energy’s Office of Policy said last week. The official spoke on background for the purposes of engaging in a more candid discussion of the administration’s energy policies.

“This government, like any government, has a limited amount of capital, and what we are committed to is ensuring that we get for the American taxpayer maximal return on our investment,” the DOE official said. “And what that often means is not just investing in a resource that gives us as much energy as possible — as that resource can generate — but also ensuring that that resource gives us as much energy as possible for every dollar of government investment.”

The official pointed to four measures—energy density, capacity density, capacity factor and cost—as keys to the administration’s strategy.

Energy density is the amount of energy stored in a system by volume or mass. Capacity density looks at how much energy a source offers relative to the amount of space it takes up — meaning sources that can offer stronger output with a smaller spatial footprint are preferred. Capacity factor considers actual energy output from a source over a given time period, compared to that same source’s maximum capacity — a metric that may cause intermittency to be viewed as a disadvantage.

The official said these measures complement a commitment from President Donald Trump and Energy Secretary Chris Wright “to ensuring efficient use of taxpayer funds,” adding, “From that perspective, when we also think about how much we are investing in many of these plants and resources to deploy these energy sources across the United States, it certainly does matter. It matters quite a lot.”

However, some congressional Republicans from districts with a lot of renewable energy projects — considered less desirable by some of the administration’s preferred metrics — have taken umbrage with some recent policy shifts, preferring more of what they call an “all-of-the-above” approach.

Rethinking U.S. energy priorities

The desire to use density and capacity metrics to determine how the government can get more energy for less money and effort has transformed the energy priorities of the U.S. presidency since January.

Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. government allocated billions of dollars to build out wind and solar capacity while placing harsh restrictions on coal and natural gas. They emphasized concerns about climate change and hopes that a cleaner energy mix would slow U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to support their energy strategy.

Now, the Trump administration has gutted many Biden-era grants and regulations, saying instead it will favor energy projects with greater energy and capacity density.

“If you look at fuel sources through the lens of capacity density and energy density and capacity factor, by default, some sources will be more attractive than others,” the senior DOE official said.

In just the last month, the Trump administration has taken a series of actions against wind and solar projects, as well as others favoring coal, oil and nuclear power.

Abrupt rescissions of funding and approvals from the departments of the Interior and Transportation have stymied wind projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Michigan and California.

Solar projects also have been targets for funding cuts. The Agriculture Department announced it would stop subsidies for solar installations on the nation’s farmland. And the administration’s termination of the Biden-era “Solar for All” program pulled back $7 billion in grant funds for solar projects across the country.

At the same time, the Interior Department has approved multiple coal mine expansions and rolled out an expanded offshore oil leasing schedule. And the White House has set new and ambitious goals to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear power, which the DOE is supporting with regulations and resources.

“It does appear that they’re stacking the deck against certain technologies,” said Doug Vine, director of energy analysis at the nonpartisan think tank Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.

Nick Loris, executive vice president of policy at the Conservative Coalition for Climate (C3) Solutions, agreed, saying the administration’s actions indicate an escalating “resource bias war” between Democrats and Republicans.

“There was always a bit of resource biases between Democrats and Republicans in that typically Republicans are favoring fossil fuels and nuclear, and the Democrats are favoring renewables,” he said.

Even though Republicans have recently championed an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy, Loris said there’s been a noticeable shift.

“That’s certainly changed a bit, I would say, in the past several months with just the more political attacking of wind, primarily, but also solar to some extent and battery technologies and EVs to some extent,” he said. “So a little bit of a regression from the ‘all-of-the-above’ language to more specific attacks on specific technologies and industries.”

But the “all-of-the-above” strategy always had some ambiguity, Loris said, as there hasn’t always been clarity about whether the slogan meant the nation should subsidize projects so that all forms of energy flourish or if politicians should leave things up to market factors without providing subsidies or regulations.

Sticking to ‘all of the above’

On Capitol Hill, some Republicans who espouse an “all-of-the-above” approach have taken issue with some of the administration’s recent moves.

After news broke in late August that the administration would withdraw approval for a wind project off the coasts of Delaware and Maryland, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., called on the White House to reconsider.

“As a supporter of an ‘all of the above’ approach for energy, which will lead to energy dominance for America, I find it odd that Pres. Trump would kill this 1,000 job project,” Bacon said in a post on X. “Our country needs a balanced mix of clean & reliable energy so we don’t have to rely on energy imports from Russia, Venezuela, & others. This project was 80 percent complete, with an investment of $1.3B already in the ground. I urge the Admin to reconsider this move.”

And ahead of the August recess, Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, put a hold on three Treasury Department nominations as a form of protest while he awaited the department’s guidance on new tax credits for wind and solar projects. The guidance, which has since been released, cut one of the two ways projects could previously qualify for the credits.

But the administration argues its moves don’t demonstrate “misalignment” with its party’s energy priorities.

“When we think about ‘all of the above,’ what we are saying fundamentally is that we are not going to prioritize a very specific energy source for reasons, frankly, that have nothing to do with improving the affordability, the reliability and the secure access to that source,” the senior DOE official said. “So I do not see a misalignment, as far as that’s concerned.”

Democrats focus on wind and solar

So far, references to density as justification for rescinding approvals and funding for wind and solar projects are not landing on the political left.

“It’s everything they can concoct to kill off clean energy and open up millions of acres of public land to fossil fuel development,” Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said. “None of this is a surprise.”

Congressional Democrats have shown increasing frustration over the cancellation of wind and solar projects, most of which have aimed at projects in blue states.

In a business meeting of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last week, ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., lamented the recent cancellations of projects off the coast of his home state, where he noted offshore wind is an “enormous industry.”

“About a little over a week ago, when a thousand trades workers were putting their gear together to go out and do their well-paid work on this facility, which is already 80 percent complete — out of the clear blue sky with no notice or warning, came a stop work order bringing the entire project to a halt,” Whitehouse said. “There’s been no plausible explanation of why, other than the individual predilections of a president who doesn’t like windmills.”

Energy demand on the rise

Demand for electricity is increasing across the U.S. for the first time in about 20 years, according to the Energy Information Administration. That upward trend often is attributed to increasing needs from AI data centers and industry.

With energy needs on the upswing, the Trump administration is making the case that by considering density and capacity, the government will get more for its money. Walking back some of the previous administration’s investments in favor of other sources is part of that effort.

“The administration’s commitment is to not prioritize very specific energy sources that, frankly, don’t necessarily deliver on their commitment,” the DOE official said, adding that capacity factor was a great example for offering generation comparisons.

The official said studies show “in general, the average capacity factor for a solar or wind farm is somewhere between 20 to 32 percent. That is remarkably low.”

“The average capacity factor for a nuclear plant is 92.5 or higher percent,” the official added. “If you are the government, and you are trying to ensure that energy is affordable, reliable and secure, which source would you pick?”

There are complications related to every energy source though, said Vine of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. For instance, he said, although nuclear power may offer greater density and capacity, it takes much longer to build out than wind and solar. And though wind and solar have greater capacity challenges, pairing solar with batteries or spreading wind farms over more land can help address those, he said.

“The electric power system has been referred to as one of the most complex systems that we’ve ever devised,” Vine said. “Each technology brings something.”

As debate continues over what the ideal energy mix to address the nation’s rising demand should be, C3 Solutions’ Loris said there’s a “very legitimate tension” among some Republicans about the administration’s pushback on wind and solar — including some sentiments that the agencies are “erecting barriers” that unnecessarily harm clean energy projects.

Whether Congress chooses to take that up this fall remains to be seen, Loris said. “If they are going to fight that fight, it’s going to be through a legislative process that really tries to fix permitting reform for all energy sources and technologies.”

“I think that’s the best hope in which you can kind of defang the agencies’ ability to block projects or put up additional regulatory barriers, if you fix some of those abilities to do so through the legislative process,” he said.

Late last fall, my neighbors and I received a notice from our utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, informing us of proposed rate increases from an eye watering $761.3 million Billing Modernization Initiative. Digging further into their filing with the California Public Utilities Commission, PG&E highlights the need to update a profoundly outdated system, featuring a potpourri of vendor and custom in-house software from the 1990s and 2000s, much of it written in a programming language (COBOL) that peaked in popularity last century and for which there are vanishingly few engineers with expertise in it.

Additionally, the filing highlights that the billing system has been unable to keep pace with regulatory needs, forcing delays and complex workarounds. In brief, PG&E’s key digital systems are unable to satisfy business needs and therefore need an expensive overhaul, raising customer rates. As a result, my monthly electric bill is going up.

I pick on PG&E because I’m their customer and they offer a good example, not because they are an industry exception.

Most utilities and regulators struggle with these very same digital modernization challenges. Billing is a core function for any business. If utilities can’t maintain their core systems, then how can they be expected to roll out and operate more advanced digital functionality such as dynamic rates, distributed energy resource orchestration, virtual power plants, demand response programs, electric vehicle charging optimization and AI, all while defending against ever-increasing cyber security attacks and maintaining affordability? Short answer: they can’t, not without a serious culture change to become technology companies that embrace best practices for digital innovation.

As part of their CPUC filing, PG&E notes that Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric launched similar billing system upgrades in 2016 and 2017, respectively. This key point offers us a thread to pull on and the pathway to that culture change. Let’s take a brief detour to other industries, and then circle back here.

Sharing is caring (about efficiency)

Software engineers are known to be proudly lazy, with a penchant for automating repetitive tasks and creating shared, reusable building blocks to avoid duplication of effort. These building blocks are like Legos that get reassembled, repurposed and built on top of to create ever more complex software applications.

You may think that this sharing is limited to within one organization, but in fact it is industry-wide and even frequently happens between competitors. This collaboration is done through an approach called “open source,” in which software code is shared freely with others to reduce barriers for adoption and contribution. These shared software building blocks solve industry-wide problems more quickly, cheaply and securely than any one organization can do it themselves.

This approach has been wildly successful, delivering widespread and pervasive technologies such as Linux (an operating system ubiquitous across data centers and embedded devices), Kubernetes (runs most cloud workloads), and PyTorch (used to create many modern generative AI models). All of your modern digital tools, such as Microsoft’s products, are built on top of open source foundations. From Microsoft: “Our developers use more than 200,000 open source components every month while building products and services.”

As open source technology and collaboration has matured, industries have embraced it as a key business strategy to reduce costs, drive interoperability and maintainability, and improve cybersecurity.

The most visually appealing example is the film industry. Technology companies like AWS, Microsoft and NVIDIA work with film studios like Dreamworks, Sony Pictures and Disney to co-create the shared digital infrastructure for movies. The results are Oscar-winning pictures like Flow and Dune, powered with open source technologies. For a more heavily-regulated industry, look to finance. These aren’t your grandfather’s banks. Modern financial institutions are tech companies, fully embracing digitalization as a way to drive customer value, lower costs and improve security. Through the FINOS initiative, dozens of banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan join technology vendors like Google and Red Hat to solve problems faced by all banks, such as regulatory compliance, interoperability and data access. And to explore an industry using more operational technology, look to telecom where mobile operators like T-Mobile and Verizon collaborate with vendors such as Infosys, Nokia and Qualcomm.

These industries and others have learned that there is business value in creating an ecosystem of shared technology building blocks. All participants mutualize the investment cost to develop foundational elements necessary to drive the industry forward, pieces that are table stakes for the market to grow. Customers like the film studios, banks and mobile operators are able to work directly with their vendors not on static requirements documents, but on actual, working technology that can evolve and be iterated upon with industry needs. As an added benefit, working together in the open forces software development best practices, driving even more improvement. The resulting technology is useful, secure and scalable enough to execute sensitive financial transactions and operate massive telecom networks.

The status quo is a dead end. Open collaboration delivers affordability and more.

Now, back to PG&E and their Billing Modernization Initiative. They note that SCE and SDG&E recently launched similar efforts. Instead of each utility pursuing their own, independent initiative, what would it look like if they borrowed from the digital best practices exemplified by the film, banking and telecom industries?

The IOUs of California would get together and scope out areas of overlap. Once defined, they could engage with multiple technology providers to co-create the shared building blocks needed across all of them. The resulting technology assets would be open source, ensuring transparency to regulators and rate payers, straightforward cybersecurity audits, and implementation of software development best practices such as automated testing and continuous integration.

With these shared building blocks in hand, each utility could assemble them and customize as needed for their business, leveraging in-house expertise or technology vendors as needed. Because much of the investment burden was shared by utilities, overall initial development and ongoing maintenance costs are lower, and development speed is higher because resources can be focused on initiatives that directly deliver added value. Vendors waste less time on interoperability and instead can focus on strategic differentiators. And instead of going up, my utility bill goes down because PG&E is able to better optimize the grid through dynamic rate structures.

Keeping the status quo digital practices will yield more of the same — delayed projects, exploding budgets, and software that doesn’t work. We’ll never deliver on the energy transition if we stay on this path. It’s time for a culture change. Utilities and regulators should look to other industries and how they leverage open collaboration to lower costs, accelerate development and improve maintainability. Digital modernization should drive costs down, not up, allowing utilities to fully use physical infrastructure and avoid larger investments.

Across the five projects, the utility has signed off on PPAs lasting for at least 20 years: a 200MW project in Jefferson County and a 225MW project in Laurens county received 20-year offtake agreements; a 260MW project in Mitchell County signed a 25-year PPA; and a 200MW project in Coffee County signed a 30-year offtake deal. The fifth project is a 183MW solar project in Wilkinson County, to be paired with a 91.5MW battery energy storage system (BESS), which signed a 20-year offtake agreement.

The utility also closed bids in August for the 2025 edition of the CARES programme, making a request for proposals for up to 2GW of utility-scale solar, as Georgia Power looks to grow the proportion of solar in its energy mix. In July, the PSC approved the utility’s latest integrated resource plan (IRP), which will see the utility aim to add 4GW of new renewable power capacity by 2035.

Fossil fuels and renewables in Georgia

However, some of the IRP includes provisions for an expansion of a nuclear power plant and upgrades to a natural gas plant, as the utility looks to meet what it expects to be a growth in electricity demand of 8.5GW by the end of the decade.

PV Tech reached out to energy analyst RMI about the role of fossil fuel projects in various US states’ IRPs earlier this year, and asked whether continued interest in fossil fuel developments reflects a lower levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for fossil fuel projects versus renewable alternatives. An RMI spokesperson told PV Tech that fossil fuel LCOE has grown over time, and that “the price of a gas turbine when contracts are signed may be significantly higher than the price estimated during planning.”

The spokesperson went on to use the example of the Cayuga combined-cycle plant in Indiana, where procurement costs for the project were 36% higher than were estimated in previous IRPs, raising questions about the long-term financial security of fossil fuel investments in state IRPs.

Meanwhile, figures from Lazard show that the LCOE for utility-scale solar in the US fell 4% between 2024 and 2025, the third consecutive year that the LCOE of US solar has fallen.

Purchase the full report here, download the executive summary, or read on for some key highlights.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) is a seismic shift for the solar industry

Officially signed into law on July 4th, the OBBBA has fundamentally changed the federal policy landscape for energy. Sweeping changes to tax credits across numerous technologies as well as new Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) requirements will serve as an inflection point for multiple trends across the power sector. Most importantly for the solar industry, the OBBBA cuts short many of the federal tax credits previously available as a result of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The solar industry will no longer have access to the Section 48E and 45Y tax credits after 2027 or the Section 25D tax credits (for customer-owned residential solar) after 2025. These tax credits were previously available in full until US greenhouse gas emissions reached 25% of 2022 levels – a threshold that Wood Mackenzie forecasts would not occur until after 2040. However, if a solar project starts construction on or before July 4, 2026, it has at least four years to come online to earn tax credits. Otherwise, solar projects that begin construction after that date must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to be eligible for 48E and 45Y credits.

Given this new policy context, solar project developers are acting quickly to advance projects in their pipeline. From 2025-2030, our base case outlook puts total solar deployments at 246 GWdc – 4%, or 11 GWdc, lower than our pre-OBBBA outlook. The negative impacts of the OBBBA are muted in the near-term. This is due to projects already underway, the rush to bring projects online before tax credit deadlines, and intense demand for power supply as new gas generation has become more expensive and less available.

Our low case forecast captures downside risk from new US Treasury guidance and permitting uncertainty

On top of these massive tax credit changes, the solar industry is navigating several other federal policy actions. On July 15th, days after passage of the OBBBA, the Department of the Interior (DOI) issued a memorandum stating that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum will need to personally sign off on numerous types of federal permitting approvals for solar and wind projects. The scope of the memo is still unclear – it named dozens of actions that projects might need to take (whether they are directly sited on federal lands or not) that would be under heightened scrutiny.

Additionally, the Treasury Department issued new guidance on August 15th that made changes to the formal definition of the “beginning of construction” for solar and wind projects utilizing federal tax credits. Under the former definitions, a project could begin construction by one of two pathways: incur at least 5% of the project’s costs (referred to as the “Five Percent Safe Harbor”) or begin onsite or offsite “physical work of a significant nature” (known as the “Physical Work Test”). Once a project uses either pathway, it must be placed in service no later than the end of the calendar year that is four years after the beginning of construction.

Effective September 2nd, the new Treasury guidance mostly maintains these criteria. But for projects over 1.5 MWac, it removes the Five Percent Safe Harbor option, requiring these projects to utilize the Physical Work Test. While the solar industry is familiar with the Physical Work Test, it offers fewer bright line tests than the Five Percent Safe Harbor. This will create some uncertainty for solar projects aiming to start construction after September 2nd. And importantly, the Treasury noted that it has not yet addressed construction-start rules for the sake of the new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements that will apply to projects starting construction in 2026.

We’ve included a low case forecast of solar deployments in addition to our base case forecast this quarter to capture these additional uncertainties. Our low case outlook has more pessimistic assumptions for federal permitting and Treasury Department guidance.

Our five-year outlook predicts 246 GWdc of solar installations, with 18% downside risk (44 GWdc) in our low case

Our low case forecast results in about 30% less solar capacity coming online in 2026 and 2027 compared to our base case. The differential between the two forecasts softens from 2028 onward, averaging 17% less capacity in the low case.

Strong demand for new energy supply and rising power prices strengthen the market fundamentals for new solar projects in the long term. Overall, our low case is 18% lower (44 GWdc) than our base case over the next five years. The market reality for the solar industry will be shaped by federal policy actions and their outcomes in the coming months.","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/photography/solar/macro_solar/macro_power_istock-471670114.jpg?w=800&h=480&mode=crop&center=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-09-08 16:03:23.030323

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain.
Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state.
Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

In their study, the authors conducted an extensive review of existing literature on the application of digital twins in renewable energy systems.
The study reveals that digital twins offer significant advantages across various renewable energy systems: Wind energy: Digital twins can predict unknown parameters and correct inaccurate measurements, enhancing system reliability and performance.
Limitations The authors identify several limitations in the application of digital twins across different renewable energy systems: Wind energy: Digital twins face challenges in accurately modelling and monitoring environmental conditions.
Biomass energy: When used with biomass energy systems, digital twins still struggle to simulate the entire production supply chain.","Researchers are exploring AI-powered digital twins as a game-changing tool to accelerate the clean energy transition. These digital models simulate and optimise real-world energy systems like wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, and biomass.

But while they hold immense promise for improving efficiency and sustainability, the technology is still riddled with challenges – from environmental variability and degraded equipment modelling to data scarcity and complex biological processes.

As the world grapples with the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change, researchers at the University of Sharjah, UAE, are turning to a cutting-edge technology that could reshape the future of energy: AI-powered digital twins.

According to the researchers, these digital replicas of the physical world have the potential to transform the generation, management, and optimisation of energy across diverse clean energy platforms, accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels, which environmental scientists associate with global warming.

A cornerstone of innovation across industries

Digital twins' ability to replicate and interact with complex systems has made them a cornerstone of innovation across industries, driving improvements in efficiency, cost reduction, and the development of novel solutions.

However, the scientists caution that current digital twin models still face notable limitations that restrict their full potential in harnessing energy from sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass.

""Digital twins are highly effective in optimising renewable energy systems,"" the researchers write in the journal Energy Nexus. ""Yet, each energy source presents unique challenges – ranging from data variability and environmental conditions to system complexity – that can limit the performance of digital twin technologies, despite their considerable promise in improving energy generation and management.""

In their study, the authors conducted an extensive review of existing literature on the application of digital twins in renewable energy systems. They examined various contexts, functions, lifecycles, and architectural frameworks to understand how digital twins are currently being utilised and where gaps remain.

To extract meaningful insights, the researchers employed advanced text mining techniques, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. This scientifically rigorous approach enabled them to analyse large volumes of raw data and uncover structured patterns, concepts, and emerging trends.

From this in-depth analysis, the authors drew several key conclusions. They identified research gaps, proposed new directions, and outlined the challenges that must be addressed to fully harness the potential of digital twin technology in the renewable energy sector.

Following a detailed discussion on the integration of digital twins across various renewable energy applications, the authors summarised their most significant findings across five major energy sources: wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass.

Each source presents unique opportunities and challenges, and the study offers a comprehensive overview of how digital twins can be tailored to optimise performance in each domain.

The study reveals that digital twins offer significant advantages across various renewable energy systems:

Wind energy: Digital twins can predict unknown parameters and correct inaccurate measurements, enhancing system reliability and performance.

Solar energy: They help identify key factors that influence efficiency and output power, enabling better system design and optimisation.

Geothermal energy: Digital twins can simulate the entire operational process – particularly drilling – facilitating cost analysis and reducing both time and expenses.

Hydroelectric energy: The AI-driven models simulate system dynamics to identify influencing factors. In older hydro plants, they are used to mitigate the impact of worker fatigue on productivity.

Biomass energy: Digital twins improve performance and management by offering deep insights into operational processes and plant configurations.

But the authors' contribution to the field stands out in highlighting critical limitations in the application of digital twin technology across these energy sources. Their analysis underscores the need for more robust models that can address specific challenges unique to each renewable energy system.

Limitations

The authors identify several limitations in the application of digital twins across different renewable energy systems:

Wind energy: Digital twins face challenges in accurately modelling and monitoring environmental conditions. They struggle to simulate critical factors such as blade erosion, gearbox degradation, and electrical system performance – particularly in ageing turbines.

Solar energy: Despite their potential, digital twins still fall short in reliably predicting long-term performance. They have difficulty tracking panel degradation and accounting for environmental influences over time, which affects their accuracy and usefulness.

Geothermal energy: A significant obstacle is the lack of high-quality data, which hampers the ability of digital twins to simulate geological uncertainties and subsurface conditions. The technology also faces complexity in modelling the long-term behaviour of geothermal systems, including heat transfer and fluid flow dynamics.

Hydroelectric energy: Applied to hydroelectric projects, digital twins face challenges in accurately modelling water flow variability and in capturing environmental and ecological constraints. These limitations reduce their effectiveness in optimising system performance and sustainability.

Biomass energy: When used with biomass energy systems, digital twins still struggle to simulate the entire production supply chain. They fall short in providing precise models for biological processes, biomass conversion, and the complex biochemical and thermochemical reactions involved.

The authors emphasise the broader implications of these shortcomings for the renewable energy sector. To address these challenges, they offer a set of guidelines and a research roadmap aimed at helping scientists enhance the reliability and precision of digital twin technologies.

Their recommendations focus on improving data collection methods, advancing modelling techniques, and expanding computational capabilities to ensure digital twins can deliver trustworthy insights for decision-making and system optimisation.",https://www.engineersireland.ie/Portals/0/EasyDNNnews/12283/img-a1m-digital-twin-of-oil-rig.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 14:04:41.559674

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she is optimistic about reforming the federal permitting process for energy projects.
“One of the things that’s holding you all up, the state up and others up for building is the permitting process,” she said.
Capito said she hopes her committee can produce a bill with “reasonable deadlines” that treats all types of energy projects the same.
“We’re going to have a shortage of power if we cannot permit and we cannot move forward with energy development,” Capito said.
“We have the resources here in this country, but we’ve got to get to permitting.” Capito said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., the ranking member on the committee, also supports reform.","Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she is optimistic about reforming the federal permitting process for energy projects.

Capito, who chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, recently told attendees of the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce Annual Meeting and Business Summit that a bipartisan compromise finally could be possible after numerous stalled attempts.

“One of the things that’s holding you all up, the state up and others up for building is the permitting process,” she said. “The regulatory morass of trying to build something in this country is just ridiculous. It’s overburdened, it’s timely, it’s costly and some people just give up.”

Capito cited the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a natural gas project that faced years of delays due to lawsuits from environmental groups and ultimately required an act of Congress to be completed.

“Even though it sat there 95% complete,” she said.

Capito said she hopes her committee can produce a bill with “reasonable deadlines” that treats all types of energy projects the same.

“If you’re building a solar farm or if you’re building a natural gas pipeline or you’re doing a coal mine, if you can get the permit, you can go,” she said. “Quite honestly, the Biden administration had their foot on the scale for all renewables, and that’s where we ended up having even more time and more projects canceled and less energy.”

The country is expected to require more energy than ever before to power data centers and artificial intelligence systems, making permitting reform even more important, she said.

“We’re going to have a shortage of power if we cannot permit and we cannot move forward with energy development,” Capito said. “We have the resources here in this country, but we’ve got to get to permitting.”

Capito said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., the ranking member on the committee, also supports reform.

“He and I are rolling up our sleeves and trying to find a solution,” she said. “He can’t get his solar panels built and I can’t get my coal mines open, or my natural gas pipelines or my wind farms if we can’t get this permitting done.”

Capito, along with former Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., has supported numerous attempts in recent years to overhaul the permitting process.

The delegation’s efforts to pass legislation have taken various forms over the past two years — as standalone bills, as deals with the White House and as part of larger legislative packages — but all have included reining in project timelines and limiting legal challenges.

Manchin called reforming the permitting process the “final goal” of his time in the Senate but was unable to see the project to fruition before stepping down at the start of the year.

In a 2022 op-ed, Manchin said the process is “broken” and “consumed by bureaucratic delays and endless litigation at every turn.”

“Let me be clear: The road ahead to enact meaningful permitting reforms is not easy,” Manchin wrote. “But if we put partisan politics aside and truly work on behalf of all West Virginians and the American people, like they deserve, then we can find a solution that strengthens our energy security and ensures America remains a global energy leader.”",https://www.capito.senate.gov/assets/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:20:17.950936

Dive Brief:

Indiana’s governor last week pressed for lower utility rates from investor-owned companies with utilities in the state: AES, American Electric Power, CenterPoint Energy, Duke Energy and NiSource.

“We can’t take it anymore,” Gov. Mike Braun, R, said in a Sept. 3 press release. Braun directed Abby Gray, the state’s new ratepayer advocate, to evaluate utility profits and look for cost-saving measures that would ease utility rates. “I would also like to see the utilities’ investors bear more of the cost of doing business,” Braun said.

Analysts with Jefferies and Capstone say they doubt Braun’s comments will derail a proposal to create NIPSCO Generation, a company affiliated with NiSource’s Northern Indiana Public Service Co. that would build and own power plants to serve data centers and other “megaload” customers.

Dive Insight:

The action in Indiana highlights the nationwide affordability pressures that are colliding with the potential need to build power plants and power lines to serve planned data centers, manufacturing plants and other loads.

In Indiana, average residential electric bills surged about 17.5% over the 12-month period ending July 1 — the most in 20 years, according to analysis from Citizens Action Coalition, a ratepayer-focused advocacy group based in Indianapolis. Average residential bills increased 9.3% during that period in 2023-2024, the group said.

NIPSCO’s average residential bills saw the highest increase in the state, jumping 26.7% this year and 17.8% in 2024, followed by CenterPoint at 24.9% and 7.1% in the same periods, Duke at 19.8% and 1%, AES at 12% and 11.9%, and AEP’s Indiana Michigan Power at 3.9% and 8.8%, CAC said.

AES Indiana is seeking a two-part rate increase that could total about 13.5%, or $21 a month, for a typical residential customer by 2027, on top of a 6% increase set to take effect next year.

In other Indiana utility news, two members of the five-member Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on Sept. 3 said without explanation that they are leaving the agency next month, before their terms expire. IURC commissioners Sarah Freeman and Wesley Bennett plan to step down on Oct. 10 and Oct. 17, respectively.

Freeman has been an IURC commissioner since September 2016; Bennett has served at the agency since May 2023. Freeman’s term expires on Jan. 1, 2026, and Bennett’s term ends April 1, 2026.

“Both commissioners were heavily involved in industry stakeholder engagement, including at [the] National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, and known favorably by investors,” Jefferies equity analysts said Thursday. The action is a “clear negative development” for NiSource, but also for the other IOUs in the state, the analysts said.

Braun’s comments on utility rates were likely driven by voter pressure, according to research firm Capstone. “However, we do not believe his messaging will result in meaningful rate impacts for utilities or an unfavorable IURC composition, given his alignment with Trump interests and a desire to maintain a favorable business environment in Indiana,” analysts said in a client note on Friday.

Capstone analysts said they expect the IURC will likely approve NIPSCO Generation’s data center power proposal before Bennett and Freeman leave the agency. If they leave before the decision is made, the IURC will still have a quorum to make a decision, they noted.

“We also believe Braun to be supportive of NIPSCO and other utilities’ efforts to increase generation capacity for meeting growing data center demand, largely in line with the Trump administration’s priorities,” the analysts said.

NIPSCO, NIPSCO Generation and the NIPSCO Industrial Group reached a settlement agreement on the plan in mid-July.

Creating a separate generation company would allow NIPSCO to serve megaload customers by meeting their unique demands so that Northwest Indiana does not lose out on economic development opportunities due to “regulatory obstacles,” NIPSCO Generation said in an Aug. 15 filing at the IURC.

The plan protects existing customers by isolating risks to the generation company while maintaining NIPSCO’s financial integrity, the company said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/dY535YnLv-7phaJfsFRlO7F7tjlOUpHh-CInE4nih_k/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE4OTY1ODk5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-08 11:04:35.694579

DETROIT, MICHIGAN - September 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Easy Environmental Solutions Inc., previously known as Digital Utilities Ventures Inc. (OTC: DUTV) and listed under the same name, just officially announced receiving the full down payment for the first EasyFEN™ waste-to-liquid microbial fertilizer unit in Africa. The unit will now be shipped to Kenya in the next 90 to 120 days, firmly establishing the company’s Kenya launch and setting in motion what may be a large-scale initiative to combat food insecurity and soil degradation in a region where hunger remains a critical issue.

“This is a historic moment - not only for our company but for African agriculture,” said Mark Gaalswyk, CEO of Easy Environmental Solutions. “The EasyFEN™ system isn’t just sustainable; it’s profitable, scalable and built to create lasting value for investors while transforming agriculture for entire nations. This is the model wherein doing the right thing for the planet also delivers strong financial returns.”

At full capacity, a single EasyFEN unit is expected to generate approximately $19 million in recurring annual revenue. That creates a scalable, high-margin growth model for the company and its shareholders, reports Easy Environmental Solutions.

Fighting Famine At Its Source

One-third of Kenya’s population lives below the poverty level, while 29% of the children in rural regions suffer from stunted growth due to famine. With 80% of the country’s land area arid or semi-arid, growing nutritious foods is a huge challenge. Climate change and inefficient food systems only add to the pain and suffering.

It’s not just Kenya that’s plagued by famine. About two-thirds of the continent is arid or semi-arid, and a large portion of the land used for agriculture is drying up. Desertification is a huge problem made worse by climate change, leading to starvation and a dire need for a solution. As of 2023, one in five people in Africa was going hungry. By 2030, 582 million people are projected to be undernourished globally, with over half of them living in Africa. Finding ways to grow crops is important to the continent’s survival.

That’s where Easy Environmental Solutions comes in. Its EasyFEN Modular Microbe Fertilizer System is what the company describes as a decentralized, fully automatic “Fertilizer Plant in a Box” that can be deployed at rural agricultural co-ops and communities all over the world. The fully automatic system converts waste from each local community into Terreplenish, the company’s organic microbial fertilizer that is made from recycled green biomass, food and crop waste and is targeted at lifeless, unproductive soil. The product can process two tons of biomass per hour, producing up to 2.7 million gallons of Terreplenish annually, reports Easy Environment Solutions.

Bringing Soil Back To Life

Validated by over 100 independent studies and backed by more than a decade of field data, the company says Terreplenish restores soil health, boosts yields and reduces irrigation or rainfall needs by up to 20%. Easy Environmental Solution says two gallons per acre delivers 45–60 lbs. of nitrogen and 15–20 lbs. of phosphorus, enabling each unit to treat 1.35 million acres (approximately 546,000 hectares) of farmland every year.

There are several other benefits to using Terreplenish, too, according to the company. They include improving plant growth, reducing chemical dependence and supporting sustainable, regenerative farming practices that strengthen soil health to naturally defend against fungal threats without the need for chemicals.

Spreading Across Africa

Once an EasyFEN unit is up and running, it can produce enough Terreplenish annually to support food production for more than five million people. As a result of that, it's not only Kenya that is interested. Easy Environmental Solutions has already delivered Terreplenish samples to the Congo, Tanzania and Somalia, with field trials exceeding expectations, reports the company. The idea is to deploy as many EasyFEN units as it takes to make a tangible dent in the hunger situation in Africa.

“This isn’t just about technology - it’s about sovereignty, stability and long-term agricultural independence,” said Bakry Osman, Director of Africa Operations. “Our goal is Terreplenish® in every African country by 2027. We’re not offering short-term fixes. We’re replacing broken systems at scale.”

World hunger is a growing problem, and Africa is ground zero. With desertification worsening, leading to starvation, it's a problem that needs a solution. Easy Environmental Solutions says it will soon demonstrate it has the answer in Kenya. With its first EasyFEN unit gearing up to be shipped and put into operation, it could be the start of a revolutionary agriculture shift for the better in Africa.

“This is what the world has been waiting for,” said Nate Carpenter, Vice President of Global Operations - Eastern Hemisphere. “High profits for developers and affordable pricing for farmers. In an era of famine and water scarcity, the EasyFEN™ isn’t just a solution - it’s the new gold standard, and we’re ready to lead the charge.”

Tesla, Rivian and Lucid were prime beneficiaries of this system.","U.S. President Donald Trump’s unfriendly stance on electric vehicles (EVs) is set to reshape the auto industry. His “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in July, will end the federal EV tax credits on Sept. 30.

Until then, eligible buyers can still knock $7,500 off the sticker price—on top of other incentives— but once the deadline is here, the perk disappears. Additionally, the bill has scrapped the penalties for automakers who fail to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.

Just a few years ago, under the Biden administration, automakers were doubling down on EVs. Tax breaks, supportive policies and stricter emissions rules pushed companies to speed up their e-mobility efforts.

But things have changed now. Trump’s rollback of incentives and regulations, along with new tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, is changing the economics of EVs in the United States. The shift is forcing legacy automakers to rethink their electrification plans.

Detroit’s Legacy Carmakers Welcome the Shift

For traditional automakers like General Motors GM and Ford F, the policy change comes as a financial breather. Bloomberg recently reported that this rollback could unlock billions of dollars for Detroit carmakers to reinvest in gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicles.

Ford CEO Jim Farley even called the policy shift a “multibillion-dollar opportunity” for its gas and hybrid business. GM CFO Paul Jacobson echoed the sentiment, saying the removal of fines will start saving the company money as early as 2026.

The reason is simple— without fuel economy fines, Ford and General Motors no longer need to buy regulatory credits from EV-only players. GM has spent $3.5 billion on credits since 2022, while Ford has cut $1.5 billion in similar purchases this year. They can now redirect the money into profitable gas-powered trucks and SUVs.

GM and F currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

GM and Ford Scale Back EV Ambitions

This policy reset is showing up in production plans. GM recently announced it will temporarily cut one shift each for the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ between Sept. 2 and Oct. 6. While the Silverado EV and Sierra EV pickups remain in production, GM has delayed its second electric truck plant and Buick’s first EV by six months. Instead, the automaker revealed $4 billion in spending for mostly gasoline-powered vehicles—clear evidence it’s not betting everything on EVs anymore.

Ford is making similar adjustments. The company cut its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn—where the F-150 Lightning is built—to a single shift. It also scrapped plans for an all-electric three-row SUV in Ontario. Instead, Ford is leaning into hybrids, especially in its best-selling truck lineup. Farley has said the Ford Blue division, which builds gas and hybrid vehicles, had been shouldering most of the compliance burden under stricter rules. With Trump’s rollback, that division stands to benefit the most. In fact, Ford is retooling its Oakville plant to make Super Duty F-Series pickups starting next year, reversing its earlier plan to build EVs there.

While Detroit’s legacy automakers view the rollback as a relief, the story looks very different for pure play EV companies like Tesla TSLA, Lucid Group LCID and Rivian Automotive RIVN, which relied heavily on incentives and credits to fuel demand and profits.

EV Pure Plays Lose a Safety Net

Tesla, Rivian and Lucid are losing a major source of revenues. That’s because Trump’s rollback not only ends consumer tax credits but also kills the market for regulatory credits.

Under the old rules, automakers that fell short of fuel-economy targets had to either pay fines or buy credits from companies that exceeded the standards—mostly EV makers. Tesla, Rivian and Lucid were prime beneficiaries of this system. Now that the fines are gone, so is the need for credits. And the impact is beginning to show.

Rivian said regulatory credits made up 6.5% of its total revenues in the first half of 2025, but it doesn’t expect any credit sales for the rest of the year. Last year, Rivian earned more than $400 million from these sales. Losing that cushion makes its path to profitability even steeper.

Lucid is facing a similar squeeze. It is already battling demand and profitability challenges, so the loss of this income stream just adds to the hurdles.

Tesla, meanwhile, is taking the biggest hit in absolute dollars. Since 2019, Tesla has generated over $10.6 billion from credit sales—profits that often made the difference during lean quarters. In the last reported quarter alone, Tesla booked $439 million from credits. While that sounds strong, it’s down nearly 50% from the $890 million it earned a year earlier. The decline has been steady, quarter after quarter, and Trump’s rollback threatens to accelerate the slide.

Final Thoughts

GM and Ford, with their deep gas and hybrid portfolios, are among the winners from the EV policy changes. They would gain flexibility, save billions in compliance costs, and push forward with vehicles that still deliver strong margins.

On the losing side are Rivian and Lucid, whose business models counted on credit revenues to partially offset losses from selling EVs. Without that extra income, their road to profitability looks longer and riskier. Tesla, too, faces margin pressure as one of its reliable profit levers disappears.

A coalition of companies sponsoring SB 419 includes Shell, despite the oil and gas giant closing all of its hydrogen fueling stations for light-duty vehicles in California last year, citing a lack of demand.

The bill, which passed the state Senate and now sits in the Assembly, seeks to exempt hydrogen fuel from the taxes imposed by the Sales and Use Tax Law for the sale, storage, use, and other consumption of hydrogen fuel in California. Authored by state Sen. Anna Caballero and sponsored by the California Hydrogen Coalition (CHC), the bill is “one small and early step” in helping the industry scale renewable hydrogen fuel production so that it becomes cost-competitive with diesel, CHC Executive Director Teresa Cooke told Prism in an email. In addition to Shell, the CHC also includes Chevron, Air Liquide, Toyota, Hyundai, Linde, and FirstElement Fuel, according to financial filings. Caballero’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

SB 419 is pushing for the broader adoption of hydrogen fuel use in fuel-cell electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, both in everyday light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty transportation, but critics say it isn’t the right move. The Natural Resource Defense Council and Sierra Club California, along with several organizations, signed a letter in May opposing the bill and stating that battery electric vehicles make the most sense given their cost efficiency, climate impact, and widespread use.

The challenge is that “hydrogen is made with fossil fuels predominantly,” said Ethan Elkind, the director of the Climate Program at University of California, Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy, and the Environment. Elkind explained in an email that by taking fossil fuels, converting them to hydrogen, and then converting that hydrogen into electricity to power hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, about 50% of the energy has been lost from the original fossil fuel. So, it turns out that “hydrogen, right now, is twice the pollution of natural gas,” he said. “It’s a very inefficient way of powering really anything.”

Produced from fossil fuels

Fossil fuels are the primary feedstock for hydrogen production in the U.S. Hydrogen production is often categorized by colors such as gray, blue, and green.

Gray hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas through a process called steam methane reforming (SMR). SMR involves using high-temperature steam to produce hydrogen from a methane source such as natural gas, and it doesn’t require new infrastructure since it builds upon existing natural gas pipelines. The Department of Energy has stated that 95% of the hydrogen produced in the U.S. is gray.

Blue hydrogen is also produced from fossil fuels, but it involves carbon capture and storage, which is intended to reduce the emissions released from blue hydrogen production. However, researchers from Cornell and Stanford have found that while carbon dioxide emissions for blue hydrogen are less than for gray hydrogen, the increased use of natural gas to power carbon capture ends up resulting in higher methane emissions. These emissions end up being even higher than burning natural gas, diesel oil, or coal.

Green hydrogen is the ideal form of hydrogen, produced using surplus renewable energy such as solar and wind. It involves using electricity to power an electrolyzer, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The main concern with green hydrogen production is cost, according to Elkind. Another concern is the availability of surplus renewable energy.

“There’s only going to be extra solar power for certain hours of the day. And it’s not very cost-effective to produce hydrogen just a few hours a day or … a few weeks a year,” he said.

But CHC’s Cooke pushed back against such criticism.

“Regardless of hydrogen’s feedstock, it is being used in a zero-emission vehicle which brings significant carbon and particulate matter reductions,” Cooke wrote in her statement to Prism, adding that the U.S. power grid, supporting battery electric vehicles, is mostly fossil-fuel based.

While the latter is true, hydrogen’s feedstock cannot be disregarded simply because it is used to power a zero-emission vehicle. Hydrogen’s feedstock and its overall production process make a significant difference in its life-cycle emissions, as stated in a 2021 white paper by the International Council on Clean Transportation. The paper states that gray hydrogen, which is the primary source of hydrogen in the U.S., is only slightly lower in emissions than gasoline-powered vehicles. Even hydrogen produced through renewable energy shows higher emissions than battery electric vehicles (BEVs) powered by the same renewable energy. This is because the electricity required to produce renewable hydrogen is three times as energy-intensive as the electricity used in BEVs.

Aviation and industrial emissions are the primary areas in which hydrogen use makes sense, Elkind said. But even then, the hydrogen would have to be produced from zero-emission sources.

“If it’s produced from fossil fuels, you’re really defeating the purpose,” he said. “I think it’s reasonable for California to invest in this. I just wouldn’t want to see that investment … come at the expense of other tried and true technologies like batteries or other renewable energy sources that we need to see scale up rapidly.”

Other dangers

While SB 419 focuses on hydrogen as a fuel, hydrogen’s other applications, most prominently hydrogen blending, have also faced backlash. Hydrogen blending involves blending hydrogen with natural gas, for use in residential and commercial buildings.

Public utilities in California, such as the Southern California Gas Company, have been trying to start experimental hydrogen blending on University of California (UC) campuses. At UC Irvine, the pipeline was proposed near child day care centers, which alarmed advocacy groups and pediatricians.

“You’re experimenting with these explosive gases under where children are playing,” said Dr. Vi Nguyen, pediatrician and co-chair of the Public Health Advisory Council of San Diego-based Climate Action Campaign. A resolution authored by Nguyen and Dr. Hilary Lin, opposing hydrogen blending, was recently adopted by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

For most of its proposed use cases, namely transportation and heating homes, the consensus is that hydrogen just doesn’t make sense, according to experts interviewed by Prism. But there continues to be fossil fuel interest in hydrogen, Elkind said.

“They see it as a way for them to continue to produce and sell fossil fuels.”

Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

Hundreds of business people, policy analysts, and conservative advocates filled a downtown Cleveland conference hall last week for the National Conservative Energy Summit. One major theme: the need for both the federal and local governments to remove increasingly high hurdles to building renewable energy.

“Conservatives can and should lead on energy,” said John Szoka, CEO of the Conservative Energy Network, in his opening remarks.

The group, which cohosted the program with the Ohio Conservative Energy Forum, has a mission ​“to champion secure, reliable, affordable, clean American energy.” Its goal of achieving American energy independence includes support for a range of technologies, including solar, wind, battery storage, hydrogen, biomass, and small modular nuclear reactors.

The Trump administration has taken a more single-minded approach to energy.

Since January, it has promoted more fossil-fuel use and stalled the retirement of aging power plants. At the same time, it has rescinded grants and loans for clean energy projects; eliminated tax credits for wind, solar, EVs, and home-energy upgrades; and even halted construction on some offshore wind projects.

“While it’s easy to view this as a roadblock, … it’s a signal that we have more work to do,” Szoka said. He encouraged attendees to use what they learned during the conference in their grassroots efforts to build support for clean energy, especially when faced with extremism and misinformation. ​“If we don’t explain what’s going on clearly, we risk losing the argument before it even starts.”

As President Donald Trump attacks clean energy at the federal level, some states like Colorado and Maine are pushing to speed up deployment. But in general, state and local laws that restrict renewable energy development are gaining steam nationwide. A June report by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University notes 16 states with laws limiting solar or wind, with over 450 counties and municipalities across more than 40 states imposing other restrictions.

What country do we live in when our government tells us what we can and can’t do?

—Amanda Stallings, senior policy manager for clean-energy developer Geronimo Power

Speaking at the conference, Jenifer French, chair of Ohio’s Power Siting Board and its Public Utilities Commission, noted that approximately 30 counties in the state ban solar or wind energy in all or parts of their territories, an authority granted to them by a 2021 law known as Senate Bill 52. The board or its staff have also determined solar and wind projects are not in the public interest in several cases where bans didn’t apply but where local governments unanimously opposed the proposals.

Asked for her advice to developers, French said, ​“I just think communicating with the local officials around the project is so helpful, and being part of that community and earning their trust is very effective.”

Companies often hear such suggestions, but ​“frankly, I think that’s used as a cop-out sometimes,” said Drew Christensen, senior director of public engagement at utility-scale developer Apex Clean Energy, during a later panel about how policies shape companies’ decisions.

No matter how many community meetings are held, some people will still fight projects, putting pressure on local officials who may not have expertise in energy issues, he noted.

The deference to local governments creates a slippery slope, said Amanda Stallings, senior policy manager for clean-energy developer Geronimo Power, who also spoke on the panel. In her view, the states that pile on restrictive policies will not only see less investment from solar and wind developers, but will also discourage other industries from moving in.

Constraints on renewables also tread on landowners’ property rights, Stallings said, pointing out that in some cases a local government tells farmers not to use their land for solar but would have no problem with a housing development.

“What country do we live in when our government tells us what we can and can’t do?” Stallings said. The point resonated with various attendees from state chapters of the Land and Liberty Coalition, who made comments during networking breaks that property owners should be free to make their own economic decisions about their land.

Meanwhile, ​“this idea of behind-the-scenes picking winners and losers, that’s what’s going to create a reliability problem,” Stallings said. That risk is already visible: Late last month, the grid operator ISO New England warned of potential reliability issues from delaying Revolution Wind, a nearly finished offshore project that the Trump administration has halted for now.

This past spring, Ohio managed to pass bipartisan legislation that is expected to help the state build more energy — both renewable and fossil-fueled — in large part because the law doesn’t pick winners, according to state Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood. House Bill 15 passed with unanimous support in the Ohio Senate and just two dissenting Republican votes in the House.

Speaking on a panel about the new law, Rader called it a big step but emphasized that the state still has barriers to getting additional renewable energy on the grid.

“We don’t need to incentivize it. In Ohio, we just need a level playing field,” he said.

For one thing, the Ohio Senate removed provisions from HB 15 that would have created a community solar pilot program. Two Republicans in the House have introduced a separate bill to revive a version of that measure.

Beyond that, the law left SB 52’s extra hurdles for solar and wind in place, along with property line setbacks for wind that were tripled by a last-minute addition to a 2014 budget law.

“We have put up a lot of barriers to different forms of power over the years,” said state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, who noted that added levels of government review compound uncertainty for developers. ​“I think the solution is removing those barriers.”

The breakthrough addresses a massive challenge in battery manufacturing: how to recover valuable materials from production scraps without the use of dangerous solvents. Traditional battery recycling often depends on chemical processes that can harm workers and the environment.

This new approach uses mechanical mills to process battery cathodes made with a special plastic binder known as PTFE. The mills grind up the battery components and separate them from their metal backing, which preserves each material in its original form for immediate reuse.

Researchers at the University of Münster spent years creating this mechanical recycling technique. Their work focused on batteries manufactured through a newer production method that forgoes liquid solvents, using PTFE plastic as a binding agent instead.

The discovery could reshape battery manufacturing economics as we know them. When factories can recycle their production scraps without expensive chemical treatments, they cut costs and protect workers from exposure to hazardous substances.

These savings could reduce prices for electric vehicles and home energy storage systems.

""The recycling can be successfully implemented and scaled up dry mechanically using mills,"" said Maike Michelle Gnutzmann, a doctoral student at the university's battery research center, per Tech Xplore. ""Since the materials involved are not degraded by the recycling process, they can be directly reused.""

This technology also addresses wider environmental problems.

When battery production waste gets dumped in landfills, harmful substances often seep into soil and public water supplies. By keeping these materials in use, manufacturers reduce demand for mining operations that often damage ecosystems and communities near extraction sites.

The financial analysis shows promising results for industrial adoption. Companies that implement this recycling method may enjoy immediate cost benefits and cleaner production standards.

Battery manufacturers could begin to adopt this recycling technology within the next few years as facilities upgrade their production lines. The mechanical equipment required already exists in many industrial settings, which would make the transition more straightforward than installing entirely new chemical processing systems.

For consumers, these advances mean that future electric vehicles and home batteries could become more affordable as manufacturers reduce production waste and recover valuable materials.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/recycle-electric-vehicle-batteryimage-recK9kqzaCceGs1vr.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:17:38.212293

The findings show that using a combination of models – rather than just one – can provide a more realistic range of outcomes and can highlight the shortcomings of individual models.

“We targeted open-source data from long-term agricultural experiments in Michigan and Texas that are very different – with different climates, soils and crops grown,” said Debjani Sihi, the senior author of a paper describing the research and a member of NC State’s Plant Sciences Initiative. “By utilizing these long-term studies, we wanted to see what the future might look like in terms of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions.

“We examined three different models developed by different research groups and looked at them collectively,” said Sihi, an assistant professor with joint appointments in NC State’s Department of Plant and Microbial Biology and Department of Crop and Soil Sciences. “The architecture is a little different in these models. What can we learn from each of the models, and what is the collective information?”

The study examined data from more than three decades at the two agricultural experimental sites and calibrated it into a “model ensemble” to make future predictions. The ensemble examined both individual climate-smart agricultural practices and practices that were “stacked,” or added to each other.

The researchers then examined whether these proposed practices would, in the next 25 years or so, generate carbon sequestration in soil and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in two different scenarios: a baseline scenario that replicated climate-change historical data of the past three decades, and a “worst-case” scenario that envisions dramatic growth in greenhouse gas emissions.

“We tried to capture a variety of biological processes related to soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (methane and nitrous oxide) emission while also accounting for climate-change effects,” Sihi said. “These processes are driven by different climate variables like temperature and precipitation.”

The model ensemble showed some positive effects in both studied locations under the baseline scenario.

“At the Michigan site, we found that no-till farming and keeping crop residues on the field increased soil carbon sequestration, while using no-till farming, some cover crops, and reducing fertilizer decreased greenhouse gas emissions,” Sihi said. “At the Texas site, most of the farming practices we tried increased soil carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emissions stayed about the same. However, the models indicated that not plowing alone could reverse greenhouse gas emissions.”

The worst-case scenario, however, lived up to its name in the study.

“We also found that all the climate-smart farming practices performed worse under worst-case scenario climate change, which was expected,” Sihi said.

She added that the study could provide the impetus for other researchers to try out the model ensemble approach and improve it. Future studies could be improved by using real-world data from on-farm studies and selecting other models with different strengths to broaden the insights.

“We hope others will evaluate these climate-smart practices to learn which may be more important, and what kind of experiments that we can leverage,” Sihi said. “These are two long-term examples in Michigan and Texas that we have utilized, so that others could adopt and improve and build on it.

“In this context, utilizing no-till or cover crops as a base practice and then stacking residue retention reduced future net emissions. Future work would need more study in other parts of the country – or world – to better generalize effects.”

Session Description:

Climate change is one of the most pressing crises that humanity faces, and mitigating the problem requires the rapid deployment of new low-carbon energy technologies. Clean and renewable energy deployment is already generating countless political conflicts at the local level around the world, and the outcomes of these local conflicts will shape the future of the energy transition. This panel seeks to better understand the local politics around clean-energy siting, by examining institutional and behavioral drivers and consequences of clean-energy siting decisions in diverse geographic contexts.

The first two papers examine the local politics of clean energy facility siting in the United States, which is one of the world’s largest historical emitters of greenhouse gases. In 2022, the US finally enacted landmark federal laws—the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips and Science Act—which together contain hundreds of billions of dollars in investments to promote a transition to a cleaner energy system. These investments support several broad categories of projects, including electricity generation and clean-energy manufacturing. These two types of project generate distinct distributions of costs and benefits and, consequently, give rise to distinct political conflicts. Accordingly, two papers on our panel examine the local politics that arise in the implementation of federal programs that support electricity generation and manufacturing facilities. The first paper asks how incentives for solar electricity generation facilities are distributed among different segments of the population, whether and how misaligned incentives are a source of conflict, and how the lack of transparency or consistently regulated siting processes can impede coordination around the creation of broad and equitable community benefits. The second paper focuses on political communication and public reactions to clean-energy manufacturing facilities in a diverse set of political and economic contexts. The paper asks whether federal investments are generating expansionary momentum or backlash. Together, these two studies speak to the durability of the incentive-based approach to promoting clean energy in the United States.

The third and fourth paper shift the focus from the local consequences of energy facilities to the drivers of siting decisions. The third paper uses Denmark as a setting to examine the political determinants of clean-electricity facility siting within the decentralized institutional structure prevalent in many countries including but not limited to the United States and much of Europe. Building on the premise that local politicians are responsive to the preferences of their own electorate, this article develops and tests a new theoretical model of how local governments site energy developments. The authors argue that energy siting decentralization may hurt both efficiency and the perceived democratic legitimacy of the transition to a zero carbon economy.

Conversely, the fourth paper examines the political determinants of energy infrastructure siting in the top-down decision-making structure common in many parts of the Global South, particularly when projects are supported by external donors. The paper uses sub-Saharan Africa as a setting within which to examine the proportion of fossil and renewable energy infrastructure that can be explained by political targeting compared with geographic endowments. Initial results indicate that, in countries where fossil fuel is disproportionately politically targeted compared to other aid projects, renewable energy projects are also disproportionately likely to be politically allocated. The study implies that international efforts to support the green energy transition likely entrench local elites and raise questions about the efficacy of Just Energy Transition Partnerships.",https://i0.wp.com/politicalsciencenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54.png?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-08 12:19:11.645236

Topline:

The number of utility customers in California affected by intentional power shutoffs to reduce the risk of sparking fires has spiked this year. Most of the increase is in Southern California Edison's territory, where nearly 526,000 customers experienced safety outages through Aug. 1. In all of 2024, that figure was about 137,000, and it was just 34,000 in 2023.

Why it’s happening: Edison revisited its high-fire-risk-area maps and concluded that another 130,000 customers should fall into the risk zone where the utility may decide to roll out a public safety power shutoff, according to Brian Chen, Southern California Edison’s vice president of project and field engineering. At the same time, the state is coming off of two wetter-than-average years, during which vegetation has grown, increasing fire risk in many regions as those plants can become fuel during dry months.

What are the effects? Communities that have never been hit by public safety power shutoffs are experiencing them for the first time in 2025. That’s led to complaints from some rural residents who have been caught off guard by days of blackouts that left them overheated and frustrated.

The big picture: The situation speaks to the complexity of the politics surrounding California's grid. State leaders are pushing utilities to prioritize affordability, wildfire resilience and reliability all at once. But those three goals often conflict. Deenergizing a line on a hot, windy day may be the right decision for safety, but it strikes a blow to reliability. And undergrounding lines to avoid that trade-off is pricey, upsetting advocates who don’t want to see costs passed on to peoples’ power bills. Edison has a general rate case pending before the California Public Utilities Commission, during which regulators will decide how much the utility is allowed to raise its fees. Undergrounding wires has been a key point of contention during the proceeding, dividing the utility and affordability-minded interveners who are pushing for more focus on insulated wires and fast-trip technology.

In the Legislature: The dynamics of the entire situation could also change significantly if a sprawling bill aimed at electricity affordability, SB 254, passes, as it would reshape how California’s utilities mitigate wildfires and incorporate that work into their rates.

We’ll take a look at the week ahead and look back on what you may have missed last week.

Q&A: DEC CHIEF — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: The state’s top environmental official is fighting proposed federal funding cuts that could weaken New York’s ability to enforce clean air and water initiatives.

Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton stepped in to lead the agency six months ago, with her official confirmation by the state Senate in May. She’s overseeing the roughly 3,000-person agency at a pivotal time, with DEC’s portfolio growing and the state’s energy policy shifting in response to federal changes and affordability concerns.

Potential reduced federal funding and policy shifts pose a threat to New York’s efforts to protect the environment and fight climate change, Lefton said.

“We have a federal government that is really seeking to cut us off at our knees,” she said. “They’re trying to erase the words climate change. They’re trying to erase the words environmental justice.”

Lefton said DEC would use “every tool” to continue protecting the environment and advancing the state’s climate goals. But she acknowledged federal opposition makes that far more challenging.

Environmental groups have been critical of Gov. Kathy Hochul’s decision to delay programs like “cap and invest” that would charge for emissions and raise funds for clean energy. Her administration has also advanced a draft energy plan that won’t meet the state’s 2019 climate law target of net zero by 2050.

Lefton demurred on whether there’s a timeline to advance additional regulations for “cap and invest,” noting ongoing litigation and recent comments by the governor. Hochul recently said there are cost concerns with the program.

DEC is still planning to advance regulations requiring greenhouse gas reporting from polluters and fuel suppliers, Lefton said. That will backfill some data the federal government isn’t requiring.

What you may have missed

ENERGY MOVES: The Department of Public Service is looking for a new consumer advocate. Richard Berkley resigned from the role after three years on Aug. 26. Berkley joined the department to oversee the Office of Consumer Services, which is the first point of contact for people struggling with billing issues and other utility problems, in 2022. “We wish Richard great success on his future endeavors and have immediately begun an active search for his replacement,” DPS spokesperson Jim Denn said in a statement. “I enjoyed the caring and hard working people at the department and in the commission, and most importantly, I appreciate the opportunity to work on behalf of affordability and to solve complaints for utility consumers,” Berkley said.

NUCLEAR BOOSTS: Supporters of more subsidies for New York’s existing nuclear fleet issued a report on the benefits of keeping the three upstate plants online last week.

The Brattle Group analysis for the Carbon Free NY coalition and funded by plant owner Constellation looks at the theoretical consequences of shutting the company’s New York plants. It finds $50 billion in increased electricity costs by 2050 if three of the units close in 2029 — when the state’s subsidy program ends — and the last in 2032 when federal tax credits expire. That’s based on the state rapidly building out new resources and actually meeting its climate law targets, which Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration doesn’t expect to do because it would be too expensive. The report also highlights the 14,400 jobs supported by the plants and $10 billion federal and state tax revenue.

The Public Service Commission is considering extending the current nuclear subsidy program beyond 2029. An extension has strong support from labor and the upstate communities hosting these plants. Some environmentalists oppose continued payments. Comments are due by Oct. 20.

Hochul also joined a New York Power Authority roundtable on building the workforce for new nuclear energy, she announced after the closed-press event. “As New York State electrifies its economy and continues to attract large manufacturers that create good-paying jobs, we must embrace an energy policy of abundance that centers on energy independence and supply chain security to ensure New York controls its energy future,” Hochul said in a statement. “That begins with nuclear power for the benefit of all New Yorkers.”

Attendees included state officials, labor leaders, representatives from Ontario Power Generation and nuclear advocates. Hochul has directed NYPA to build at least 1 gigawatt of new nuclear. The authority hasn’t yet released planned solicitations for industry and community input, including potential partners. — Marie J. French

AGAINST PIPELINES: New York lawmakers and advocates called on Hochul to oppose two pipeline projects that the Trump administration has revived.

“This [pipeline project] will force New York State utility rate payers to pay over $200 million in our energy bills every year for the next 15 years to pay these costs,” said Democratic state Sen. Liz Krueger during Thursday’s press conference. “That’s inexcusable.”

Krueger said she was open to discussing language for a bill that could prevent similar situations from happening in the future. Assemblymember Anna Kelles talked up her bill to create a way to enforce emissions targets in the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. — Mona Zhang

STATES, ØRSTED SUE ON REVOLUTION WIND STOP — POLITICO’s Kelsey Tamborrino: Blue state attorneys general and the companies building the nearly completed Revolution Wind project are suing the Trump administration for its order halting work on the project off the coast of New England — escalating the fight over the stalled project that is at the center of the administration’s efforts to restrict offshore wind.

UNLOCKING MORE GAS FOR NEW ENGLAND: Many environmentalists in New York are laser-focused on opposing a proposed pipeline into New York City and pushing Gov. Kathy Hochul to reject it. In the meantime, another pipeline company is moving forward with a $300 million project that will bring more gas to New England with backing from Hochul’s fellow Democratic Gov. Maura Healey in Massachusetts.

Enbridge’s planned enhancement of the Algonquin pipeline doesn’t involve work in New York or any new compressor stations. It is far smaller — roughly a tenth of the added gas capacity — than Enbridge’s “Project Maple” proposal that previously alarmed New York pipeline opponents. Enbridge announced a final investment decision on the Algonquin Reliable Affordable Resilient Enhancement project last week.

The project “is the first step in alleviating the bottleneck of pipeline constraints that have plagued the region, helping to enhance peak day capacity,” said Enbridge spokesperson Max Bergeron in an email. “As the region continues to shift to increased reliance on intermittent energy sources, natural gas can ensure customer reliability and affordability.”

The work in Massachusetts and Rhode Island would bring an additional 75 million cubic feet of gas a day into New England. Bergeron said the company decided to “right size” Project Maple after seeking customers in 2023. The project still needs federal and state approvals and is targeting completion for 2029.

Among the customers for the Algonquin pipeline enhancement are Eversource’s gas utilities in Massachusetts for roughly half of the additional capacity. The new source of gas will improve reliability and reduce customer costs, limiting the need for liquified natural gas shipped from overseas, according to utility filings seeking approval from Massachusetts regulators.

The 10-year agreement is “critical to meeting forecasted demand from our natural gas customers in southeastern Massachusetts in the coming years and, importantly, will reduce our reliance on higher-cost, foreign liquified natural gas,” said Eversource spokesperson William Hinkle. “This agreement will provide direct benefits to customers in the near-term as the clean energy transition continues to unfold and until new, large-scale renewable resources come online.” It is expected to save Eversource customers $400 million over the course of the agreement.

Healey’s administration has been pushing the state’s utilities to find alternatives to the Everett Marine Terminal, the port where LNG is shipped into the state. “We appreciate this 10-year proposal. Massachusetts and the Northeast need more energy supply for reliability and to lower energy bills,” Healey said in a statement. “That’s why we are committed to an all-of-the above approach to energy resources, and gas continues to play an important role in our overall energy supply.”

Healey in the past opposed new pipelines into Massachusetts, but like several Democratic governors in the region — including Hochul — has shifted toward an “all of the above” mentality amid growing concerns about energy costs. — Marie J. French

NJ TRANSIT AND ALSTOM PART WAYS ON RIVER LINE: Amid an ongoing investigation of a fatal New Jersey Transit accident last fall on the River Line, the agency announced Wednesday it was parting ways with Alstom, which had a contract to provide operations and maintenance on the line. “This mutually agreed decision reflects the evolving investment needs of the service, which have grown beyond the current scope of Alstom’s contract covering River LINE operations and maintenance,” NJ Transit and Alstom said in a statement.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating both parties following an Oct. 14 crash into a tree on the tracks.

In a Wednesday statement, state Sen. Troy Singleton (D-Burlington), praised the move citing years of frustration and complaints about “the lack of communication, poor conditions, and unreliable service on the River LINE.”

“Today’s announcement — that NJ TRANSIT will assume the operation and maintenance of the River LINE — is a welcome one if it means that we will see tangible progress in modernizing service, making needed investments, implementing real-time updates, enhancing safety measures, and improving the overall rider experience,” Singleton said. — Ry Rivard

Germany, for example, uses a mix of mechanisms to stimulate low-emissions hydrogen demand and reduce risks for investors.
Korea is also using public procurement schemes to stimulate hydrogen demand in transport and services by deploying fuel cell buses and garbage trucks.
While setting an obligation has the benefit of providing markets with certainty on low-emissions hydrogen demand without relying on taxpayer money, inflexible enforcement may reduce compliance.
Policy makers need to strike the right balance between regulatory obligations and support for the uptake of low-emissions hydrogen.","Realising the potential of low-emissions hydrogen is no longer a question of future technological breakthroughs: it’s a policy challenge of the present, and countries across Asia, Europe and the Americas are implementing measures to ramp up development.

Over the past five years, project announcements for low-emissions hydrogen production have multiplied, but the final investment decisions (FIDs) required to realise those projects are trailing behind. The project pipeline for 2030 has grown to 37 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) in 2025, but only 11% of this capacity corresponds to projects that have reached a final investment decision or are already operational, according to the upcoming edition of the IEA's annual Global Hydrogen Review, which provides key insights into the latest market and policy developments.

Two main factors are at play. Firstly, the cost premium for low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives in comparison with their fossil fuel counterparts, and secondly, the lack of offtake contracts that are sufficiently long-term to reduce risks and improve the bankability of projects by providing demand certainty.

Cost premia and the willingness to commit to offtake can differ at each step in the value chain. For example, for renewable ammonia, the cost premium today can be 85% to 100% in Europe, which can be significant for an ammonia producer concerned with competitiveness and market share. However, further down the value chain, the premium can fall. For example, say renewable ammonia is used as feedstock for fertiliser, which is then used for coffee plants. The premium for the resulting cup of coffee from this crop would be less than 0.1% of the sales price, which is likely acceptable to the final consumer. That said, how this premium is distributed across stakeholders in the value chain can be complex, and it poses a coordination challenge among value chain actors, who typically lack close ties.

High costs and demand uncertainty are recurring challenges, but market contexts and policy responses differ. While some countries rely mainly on market forces and end-users’ willingness to pay a premium for low-emissions hydrogen, others are developing various support schemes and regulations. IEA Energy Policy Reviews of Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, as well as a forthcoming review of Korea, provide insights into the different approaches being taken to create more demand certainty.

As part of their decarbonisation plans, many countries and regions have developed hydrogen strategies and roadmaps that include ambitious targets for low-emissions hydrogen. Sweden, for example, has an ambitious energy policy framework built on the 2015 “Fossil Free Sweden” initiative, which brings together industry, civil society and government to build consensus around a common vision for decarbonisation. Sweden took further steps to provide long-term policy certainty by enshrining a commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 into law.

Based on this long-term policy framework, Sweden is currently significantly advancing industrial development for low-emissions processes, including hydrogen-based steel production. Stegra (formerly H2 Green Steel) is building a plant with 700 megawatts (MW) of electrolyser capacity that is set to start operations in 2026, while Swedish steel manufacturer SSAB is constructing a 500 MW plant that is expected to begin operations in 2027. Over 60% of Stegra’s planned output is secured through offtake agreements that span five to seven years from different companies in the automotive, steel processing and residential sectors, which were signed even before the FID. Initially, 18 different companies signed as offtakers, sharing and minimising individual risk. These offtakers were willing to pay a premium of up to 20% in an effort to meet their own decarbonisation targets.

Some existing features of Sweden’s energy system make low-emissions hydrogen attractive. Sweden has one of the lowest electricity prices in the European Union; this improves the economics of low-emissions hydrogen production, since electricity is the main driver of costs. Sweden also has one of the lowest power carbon intensities in the world (8 grammes of CO2 per kilowatt-hour), which qualifies hydrogen produced via grid-connected electrolysis as renewable and possibly lowers fixed costs. In addition, the European Union's Emissions Trading System, with prices of EUR 60-85 per tonne of CO2 in 2025, helps close part of the cost gap with hydrogen produced with fossil fuels.

Access to grants and guarantees has also helped to make these first-of-a-kind steel production projects possible. Sweden’s “Industrial Leap” programme supports the transition of the industrial sector to low-emissions alternatives. As part of this programme, SSAB’s HYBRIT initiative received a grant of SEK 3.1 billion (Swedish kronor), or USD 310 million, out of a total investment of SEK 20 billion (USD 2 billion). Meanwhile, nearly 20% of Stegra’s plant investment came from public finance, with grants making up 40% of that portion.

Investors in an immature hydrogen market face high risks without sufficient long-term offtake agreements that provide clarity about the direction of travel. Stable support frameworks and bankable offtake contracts are important to provide long-term investor certainty about hydrogen demand.

Germany, for example, uses a mix of mechanisms to stimulate low-emissions hydrogen demand and reduce risks for investors. The H2Global mechanism covers both producers and consumers by introducing an intermediary that compensates for the price difference for low-emissions hydrogen in auctions. Producers receive a long-term contract to reduce uncertainty, and consumers can conclude one-year contracts to avoid a lock-in effect. The European Union has also established a platform to connect buyers and suppliers of hydrogen, providing transparency to market players and information for financial support.

Germany also has a carbon contract for difference scheme for energy-intensive industries. This aims to close part of the cost premium when switching to low-carbon production alternatives for 15 years, providing certainty on cash flows. The funds are not only for hydrogen, but they are sizeable, with EUR 2.8 billion allocated in the first round and larger amounts planned for the second round.

In Korea, the power system is expected to become the main demand driver for low-emissions hydrogen, complementing nuclear and renewables. Korea is considering ammonia co-firing in coal power plants and the use of hydrogen in gas turbines. To promote this, Korea is opting for operational cost support through auctions with sustainability criteria. KEPCO, Korea’s largest electricity utility, covers the cost premium between the market and bidding prices over 15 years. While the tender conditions are still being fine-tuned, the first tender in 2024 awarded 750 gigawatt-hours per annum, and a second round launched in May 2025 aims to support 3 terawatt-hours per annum of generation from low-emissions hydrogen.

Public procurement has not yet been widely used for low-emissions hydrogen. However, it can both help create a market for low-emissions hydrogen and close the cost gap, with initial public offtake agreements that can in time lead to economies of scale. Canada, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States have endorsed the Green Public Procurement Pledge, with the intention of procuring over 30 Mtpa of low-emissions steel. Korea is also using public procurement schemes to stimulate hydrogen demand in transport and services by deploying fuel cell buses and garbage trucks. Complemented by fuel subsidies, these early-stage initiatives also aim to scale up domestic hydrogen-powered, heavy-duty vehicle production.

In addition to subsidies, a clear regulatory framework for low-emissions hydrogen can help increase offtake and provide certainty for investors. One example is the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED), which requires hydrogen produced from renewable electricity to account for at least 42% of all hydrogen used in industry by 2030, increasing to 60% by 2035. As nearly all existing hydrogen use in the European Union comes from industry, these binding targets will drive demand for renewable hydrogen.

EU member states are choosing a range of strategies to implement the directive, from incentive schemes to industry-level obligations. While setting an obligation has the benefit of providing markets with certainty on low-emissions hydrogen demand without relying on taxpayer money, inflexible enforcement may reduce compliance.

The effective design of regulations is essential. For example, one challenge if quotas are used for low-emissions hydrogen is the need to avoid “carbon leakage” from industrial firms relocating to other jurisdictions with no or less stringent regulation. Policy makers need to strike the right balance between regulatory obligations and support for the uptake of low-emissions hydrogen.",https://iea.org/assets/front/images/iea_open_graph.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 13:09:28.344664

The city’s Industrial Development Authority will hear presentations on these plans and consider proposed contracts at its regular meeting at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday.

The city has received proposed contracts for two types of environmental work: geotechnical testing, which is an evaluation of the soil, and wetland impact mitigation.

The Coleman Site, acquired by the IDA in 2011, covers 158 acres near Danville’s Goodyear plant.

It has access to major highways and utility infrastructure, but the site has been passed over by potential projects “due to lack of site readiness, particularly the absence of a graded pad,” said the staff report included in a July city council meeting agenda packet.

Before grading begins, the city plans to conduct the soil and wetland work.

Lynchburg-based civil engineering firm Hurt & Profitt has submitted a scope of work and cost proposal to the city for additional geotechnical testing at the site.

“The work will include additional soil borings to confirm rock elevations, helping to prevent unforeseen challenges during site grading by the IDA,” says the staff report in the meeting’s agenda packet.

The work could cost up to about $30,000, according to the proposed contract in the agenda packet.

The company plans to drill 30 borings ranging in depth from 20 to 40 feet, take soil samples at specific intervals, send the samples to a laboratory for testing and then backfill the borings, according to the proposed contract.

The city has also received a contract proposal from Resource Environmental Solutions, an environmental consultant based in Raleigh, North Carolina.

RES plans to generate stream credits and wetland credits, which are units of ecological value meant to compensate for inevitable environmental impacts during development.

The Department of Environmental Quality is requiring these mitigation efforts before granting a permit to grade an 80-acre pad at the Coleman Site, according to the staff report.

Stream and wetland credits are created by mitigation banks, or protected properties that restore or enhance streams and wetlands.

Credits are often created in advance of development by specialized companies like RES, and then developers purchase the credits to offset their environmental damage.

The proposed contract with RES outlines the creation of stream and wetland credits through securing mitigation areas. RES would manage the full process, which includes land acquisition, design, permitting, construction, monitoring and long-term stewardship of the mitigation areas.

Funding for the contract — $2.5 million — will come from the Virginia Business Ready Sites Grant and the Tobacco Commission Grant awarded to this project, according to the staff report.

Also this week, the Danville-Pittsylvania Regional Industrial Development Authority will meet at noon Monday, the city’s planning commission will meet at 2 p.m. Monday and the Pittsylvania County Board of Zoning Appeals will meet at 6 p.m. Monday.

Electricity costs are, on average, 5.5% higher today than a year ago, and natural gas has increased by 13.8%, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

U.S. citizens are paying more for electricity due in part to a combination of extreme temperatures and the expansion of data centers needed to support the increase in artificial intelligence usage, Shreveport Times reported.

From May 2024 to May 2025, the average residential price for one kilowatt-hour of electricity increased by almost 6.5%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Why are electricity bills going up?

Electricity costs can vary due to energy rates, taxes and utility fees in an area, with nearly 60 utility companies set to increase electricity rates this year, which will affect more than 57 million citizens, CBS News reported.

Many factors can influence the price of electricity, such as fuel prices, power plant costs, weather conditions like extreme temperatures, transmission and distribution system, as well as unregulated and regulated prices, according to the EIA.

In some regions, the increase in electricity bills is also due in part to a spike in natural gas prices, which a number of power plants use to generate electricity. Utility companies then pass costs on to customers as fuel adjustment charges, according to the Louisiana Public Service Commission.

Additionally, increased coal prices also contribute to higher overall fuel costs for power generation, which impacts customers' bills, says the Louisiana Public Service Commission.

Beyond natural gas and coal, electrical grids could have aging transmission and distribution lines that lack efficiency and can waste power. While some improvements have been made, the costs of less efficient systems are passed on to customers, Louisiana Illuminator reported.

How can I lower my electricity bill amid rising prices?

While homeowners can't control prices, they can monitor fuel costs in a household.

As for energy efficiency, residents can ensure thermostats are working correctly to avoid unnecessary use of electricity for air conditioning.

According to a recent analysis by Bloomberg, the rollback could free up capital that was previously earmarked for compliance with stringent Biden-era rules, allowing companies like General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., and Stellantis NV to redirect investments into trucks and SUVs that dominate their revenue streams.

The policy shift comes at a critical juncture for the industry, where electric vehicle adoption has slowed amid consumer hesitation over charging infrastructure and range anxiety. Insiders note that the Trump administration’s moves, including the revocation of California’s waiver to set its own tougher standards, as detailed in a June 2025 report from JDSupra, effectively loosen the regulatory noose that forced automakers to accelerate EV production or face hefty fines.

Financial Relief Amid Market Shifts

For Ford, the savings are particularly stark. CEO Jim Farley highlighted in a statement covered by Ford Authority that the rollback could preserve hundreds of millions previously spent on emissions compliance, enabling a sharper focus on high-margin internal combustion engines. This echoes broader industry sentiment, where executives have long argued that aggressive mandates distorted market dynamics, pushing unprofitable EVs at the expense of core products.

General Motors, meanwhile, stands to benefit from reduced pressure to buy carbon credits, a mechanism that cost the sector dearly under prior rules. Bloomberg’s reporting estimates that Detroit’s Big Three could collectively save upwards of $10 billion over the next decade by scaling back EV investments and avoiding penalties tied to fleet-wide efficiency targets.

Strategic Pivots and Investment Reallocations

Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler and Jeep, is already resurrecting V-8 engines for models like the Dodge Charger, a move that aligns with the relaxed standards and taps into enthusiast demand. This strategic pivot, as noted in various industry analyses, including those from Reuters on past Trump-era rollbacks, underscores how policy changes can rapidly alter production priorities.

However, not all views are uniformly positive. Some analysts warn that while short-term savings are evident, long-term risks loom if global competitors like Tesla Inc. or Chinese manufacturers continue advancing in electrification. A 2019 Forbes piece on Trump’s clean car rollback projected potential economic costs exceeding $400 billion through 2050 due to higher emissions and fuel consumption, though current administration supporters dismiss these as overstated.

Broader Economic Implications for Detroit

The ripple effects extend beyond balance sheets. In Michigan, where auto jobs are a political flashpoint, the policy is seen as a boon for manufacturing hubs. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, reflect optimistic sentiment among users, with some crediting Trump’s tariffs and rollbacks for spurring investments like Ford’s $5 billion commitment to EV batteries—ironically, a hedge against future uncertainties despite the emissions relief.

Yet, environmental advocates and some economists argue the savings come at a steep societal price. The New York Times in 2020 covered similar rollbacks, noting they could weaken U.S. competitiveness in a world tilting toward sustainability, as per their analysis. For now, Detroit’s executives are breathing easier, focusing on profitability amid a policy environment that prioritizes traditional strengths.

Navigating Uncertainty in Policy and Markets

Looking ahead, the industry must navigate potential legal challenges to these rollbacks, as states like California vow to fight back. Bloomberg’s deep dive suggests that while billions in savings are on the table, automakers are cautiously balancing gasoline-fueled profits with selective EV pursuits to avoid being caught flat-footed.

The Alberta-based nuclear development company will spend the next 12 months studying the possibility of attracting the resurgent nuclear power industry to the state. The key elements of the study will include identifying potential locations, gauging public support and laying the groundwork for the federal licensing process.

“We’re believers that nuclear will be an affordable source of power that does not need subsidies that can be competitive with other fuel types,” said Will Bridge, chief technology officer for Nucleon Energy. “That hasn’t proven itself out yet. But we also believe we need to start now.”

Nuclear energy research gets green light in North Dakota

The selection was made by the Advanced Nuclear Energy Committee, an interim committee composed of legislators, executive agency representatives and private sector leaders. The group reviewed proposals from nine firms during a Wednesday hearing, including two with North Dakota ties, but ultimately chose Nucleon Energy.

Lawmakers earlier this year approved House Bill 1025, which authorized up to $300,000 in state funding for a nuclear energy study. Nucleon’s proposal included a cost estimate of $275,000.

Nucleon specializes in small modular reactors – smaller and less expensive alternatives to the behemoth facilities providing conventional nuclear power. The company’s presentation emphasized the importance of public engagement.

“I thought Nucleon had the best background material and plan,” said Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, a member of the committee.

The company’s first step will be finding the right site. Executives emphasized the importance of existing or planned transmission infrastructure in the site selection process.

“It’s fundamental that we put these where the transmission grid either now or in the near future allows, otherwise we drive up costs for ratepayers and that’s not going to make sense for North Dakotans,” said Ryan Tourigny, Nucleon’s chief development officer.

But the crucial factor in determining whether a site could realistically host a nuclear power plant will be whether there is public support in the local community – or not.

“The permitting cycle for nuclear plants is so long and so expensive that you can’t push that into a community,” Bridge said. Nucleon has had success with bringing neutral experts into a community to educate people on the technology and ensuring that community feels like a partner on the project from day one. “We see that as just good business. You can’t push nuclear facilities into communities that don’t want them.”

The importance of early public engagement was echoed by many committee members.

“As elected officials, we run into the fact that you say the word ‘nuclear’ and you get a radioactive reaction from communities,” said Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, a member of Legislative Management.

Nuclear seen as a power solution but needs more study, legislators say

Pam Gorman Prochaska, general manager of Xcel Energy’s nuclear fleet and one of the private sector representatives on the committee, said she has seen that play out. County officials in Minnesota approached Xcel about bringing nuclear power to their community at one point, Gorman Prochaska said, but “within weeks, the anti-nuclear community had infiltrated that community and went literally door-to-door” using a lot of “scare tactics.”

One of the biggest drivers of anti-nuclear sentiment has been the question of where the radioactive waste, a byproduct of nuclear power generation, will be stored. The United States, unlike some other countries, has no centralized permanent storage facility.

“It seems like, nationally, we’ve got a crisis that we don’t have permanent storage facilities,” said Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo.

Michelle Zietlow-Miller, testifying for the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear, said the lack of a central depository for nuclear waste is not a significant issue. All of the nuclear waste produced in the United States during the last 40 years can fit on a single football field, she said, 15 yards high. The waste is solid, not liquid, and is typically stored in secure casks on-site at nuclear power facilities, she said.

Yet many questions about next generation nuclear reactors remain. Tourigny said they believe the technology will become economical over time and right now North Dakota should focus on laying the groundwork for future projects without necessarily needing to have customers for the electricity lined up.

Bridge, the chief technology officer, acknowledged there are still questions about whether the new generation of reactor technology will be economically viable. There are small modular reactors being developed around the world, Bridge said, but none have so far been proven as both affordable and commercially viable.

Other obstacles in the nuclear industry include lengthy regulatory timelines at the federal level, the potentially prohibitive cost of nuclear power plants compared to alternative fuel sources and reconstructing the domestic supply chain that has been mostly dormant for decades.

Nucleon Energy was not a unanimous choice. Five members of the committee expressed a preference for the runner-up: Excel Services Corporation, which has specialized in nuclear energy development for over 40 years. Excel was named first alternate. Nucleon’s contract for the study will be negotiated by Legislative Council and is subject to approval by Legislative Management’s chair, Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot.

Interest in nuclear power is growing as public utilities look for ways to meet the rising demand for electricity driven, in part, by the proliferation of artificial intelligence and data centers. Katie Austgen, with the Nuclear Energy Institute, told the committee there have been 530 nuclear reactors proposed across North America that could begin operating in the 2030s. Of those, two reactors were recently completed and began operating in Georgia, nine are under construction, and 23 are officially planned.

“The whole country is taking this challenge on,” said Rep. Don Vigesaa, R-Cooperstown. “It’s time to get in the race and get going with this because it’s quite a long process.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47646/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/monticello-nuclear-generating-plant-1024x6831757325704.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=YyX9t9dp,N,,2025-09-08 12:24:35.688168

Texas Senate Bill 1057, which became effective September 1, 2025, adds new Section 21.373 to the Texas Business Organizations Code (“TBOC”). This new Section of the TBOC creates a framework that governs when and how shareholders of “nationally listed corporations” may submit matters for a shareholder vote, provided that the corporation affirmatively elects to be governed by this Section of the TBOC.

Definition of “Nationally Listed Corporation”

Section 21.373 of the TBOC applies only to a “nationally listed corporation,” which is defined as a corporation that:

has a class of equity securities registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”);

is admitted to trading on a national securities exchange; and

either maintains its principal office in Texas or is listed on a Texas-headquartered exchange approved by the Texas Securities Commissioner.

Importantly, Section 21.373 of the TBOC applies to a corporation only if it makes an affirmative election to be governed by this Section through an amendment to its Certificate of Formation or Bylaws.

Section 21.002(5) of the TBOC defines a “corporation” as a “domestic for-profit corporation subject to this chapter,” which indicates that nationally listed corporations only include corporations incorporated in Texas.

Mandatory Proxy Disclosures

Before adopting the amendment to its governing documents that opts a nationally listed corporation into Section 21.373 of the TBOC, the corporation must include notice of the proposed amendment in a proxy statement provided to shareholders.

Additionally, in any proxy statement provided to shareholders, a nationally listed corporation that has opted into Section 21.373 of the TBOC must describe (i) the process by which a shareholder, or group of shareholders, may submit a proposal and (ii) how shareholders may contact one another to aggregate their holdings for purposes of satisfying the applicable share ownership threshold.

Eligibility to Submit a Proposal

Once a nationally listed corporation is subject to Section 21.373 of the TBOC, a shareholder, or a group of shareholders acting together, may submit a proposal for approval at a meeting of shareholders only if all of the below conditions are satisfied.

The shareholders, or group of shareholders, must:

hold at least (i) $1 million in market value of voting shares or (ii) 3% of the outstanding voting shares, determined on the date the proposal is submitted;

hold the requisite shares continuously for a minimum of six months before the meeting date and retain the shares throughout the meeting; and

solicit the holders of shares that collectively represent at least 67% of the voting power entitled to vote on the proposal.

Exceptions

The eligibility requirements described above do not apply to:

director nominations; or

procedural resolutions ancillary to the conduct of the meeting.

Comparison of Section 21.373 of the TBOC to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act

Section 21.373 of the TBOC is similar to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (“Rule 14a-8”) in that they both address the submission of shareholder proposals for a vote at a meeting of shareholders. However, there are some key differences, which include the following:

Section 21.373 of the TBOC addresses the requirements a shareholder must satisfy to submit a proposal for approval at a shareholders’ meeting, while Rule 14a-8 addresses the requirements a shareholder must satisfy to have its proposal included in the corporation’s proxy statement for the shareholders’ meeting.

The ownership thresholds of Rule 14a-8 are significantly lower than those of Section 21.373 of the TBOC, although Section 21.373 of the TBOC has a shorter holding period. More specifically, Rule 14a-8 requires that a shareholder hold at least $2,000, $15,000, or $25,000 in market value of the corporation’s securities entitled to vote on the proposal for a continuous period of three years, two years, or one year, respectively.

Although Section 21.373 of the TBOC has a significantly higher ownership threshold, a group of shareholders may aggregate holdings for purposes of satisfying the threshold. Rule 14a-8 expressly prohibits shareholders from aggregating holdings for purposes of meeting the requisite ownership threshold.

Section 21.373 of the TBOC further requires that the shareholder solicits the holders of shares representing at least 67 percent of the voting power of shares entitled to vote on the proposal. Rule 14a-8 has no such solicitation requirement.

These differences raise legal questions regarding how a shareholder proposal should be treated with respect to a shareholder of a nationally listed corporation that has opted into Section 21.373 of the TBOC if the shareholder (i) satisfies all of the requirements of Rule 14a-8 (and the corporation has no basis under Rule 14a-8 to exclude the proposal) but (ii) does not satisfy all of the requirements of Section 21.373 of the TBOC. One of the purposes of Section 21.373 of the TBOC seems to be to enable corporations to combat proxy abuse by imposing more stringent requirements on shareholders seeking to submit proposals at shareholders’ meetings, even when such requirements are stricter than under Rule 14a-8. This suggests that a corporation may be able to exclude a shareholder proposal satisfying all of the requirements of Rule 14a-8 if all of the requirements of Section 21.373 of the TBOC are not met (assuming the corporation is a nationally listed corporation that has validly opted into Section 21.373 of the TBOC).

Renewable energy Allete has claimed the private equity firms “are aligned with the company’s vision of continuing to advance the State of Minnesota’s clean energy goals”.","A bid by financial giant BlackRock to acquire a Minnesota electric utility could push up already-soaring utility bills, opponents warn.

The private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners, a division of BlackRock, announced a $6.2bn deal last year to take over the parent company of a Duluth-based electric utility which serves more than 150,000 customers, if the state’s public utilities commission gives the green light.

A decision is expected during the first week of October.

Some environmental and consumer protection advocates are exhorting the commission to turn down the proposal, which would see BlackRock become the controlling shareholder of the utility Minnesota Power.

“If the deal goes through, it will force ratepayers to be beholden to the private equity agenda: prioritizing profits for executives while rising prices for everyday people,” said Jenna Yeakle, Duluth-based campaign manager with the Sierra Club, said.

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has previously come under fire for its climate-warming investments.

In July, Minnesota’s department of commerce, which initially opposed the purchase, backed the bid from Global Infrastructure Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to purchase Minnesota Power and its parent company, Allete, after the firms agreed to freeze utility rates for one year and invest in green energy.

Opponents say these provisions do little to assuage their fears. Since rate increases do not currently happen each year, they say the rate freeze amounts to business as usual. And the commitment to fund renewable power is non-binding, they say.

“These capitalist vultures do not have our best interests at heart,” Cody Pals, a member of the tenants union Duluth Tenants, said at a Wednesday press conference.

Brett Christophers, author of Our Lives in Their Portfolios: Why Asset Managers Own the World, said the proposal “looks to be a classic private-equity play: buy, own for a few years and then sell at a profit”.

“As such, money will only be invested in decarbonizing Minnesota Power if [Global Infrastructure Partners] thinks that the market will reward it for undertaking that investment when it comes time to exit,” said Christophers, an economic geographer at Uppsala University.

That prospect “seems very doubtful, given the negative investor sentiment around all things clean energy-related since Trump’s return to power”, he said.

Other financial giants have also set sights on utilities. In May, private equity behemoth Blackstone announced plans to acquire a utility with 800,000 customers in the south-west US, pending Texas regulators’ approval.

Though Wall Street firms have historically shown little interest in electric utilities because they produce slow returns, that is changing amid rapid increases in energy demand due to AI datacenters.

The current landscape poses “enormous” financial opportunity, BlackRock’s CEO and founder, Larry Fink, said in a recent interview.

“Utilities make money by investing in new energy infrastructure,” said Matt Parr, communications director for the watchdog organization Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “With huge power demand comes huge ability to profit, especially if there’s an environment where utility commissions are approving rate increases.”

If approved, the Minnesota proposal could “open the floodgates” for private equity firms eyeing utilities, he said.

Reached for comment, Minnesota Power referred the Guardian to previous statements by the utility and Allete.

“Many have highlighted how the proposed partnership provides the financial strength and scale to make the clean energy investments needed to meet our state’s carbon-free energy goals while keeping bills as low as possible for all our customers,” said Allete’s CEO, Bethany Owen, in an August statement.

Owen noted that the sale enjoys backing from not only some clean energy advocates but also labor unions, businesses and the Salvation Army. (Opponents of the deal, for their part, have alleged some of those backers may have been courted or even coerced by BlackRock’s allies.)

BlackRock and Global Infrastructure Partners declined to comment on the proposal. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board did not respond to a request for comment.

Utility prices

Private equity firms have a history of raising utility prices rapidly at ratepayers’ expense, opponents say.

When one such firm bought a water utility in New Jersey, it oversaw a 28% increase in consumers’ bills over four years, despite promises to freeze rates across that period, the New York Times found.

In 2023, the state of Kansas sued another private equity firm for allegedly price-gouging gas customers during February 2021’s winter storm. Ratepayers saw a 200% price increase, state officials say, while the firm reaped $215m in profits, according to the Wall Street Journal.

“Why would there be private equity interest in a utility if it weren’t for their ability to achieve the kind rates of return and profit margins that they expect?” said Maggie Schuppert, a director at the rural environmental justice group Cure Minnesota. “One way to achieve those high margins is by increasing bills.”

In another example, after an electric cooperative in Michigan was bought by a private equity firm, it’s rates soared. Its prices were 9 cents per kilowatt higher than the average private utility in the state as of late last year, according to a July ruling from a Minnesota judge that unambiguously recommends state regulators reject BlackRock’s proposal.

Global Infrastructure Partners has “not met their burden of proof to show the transaction is consistent with the public interest”, administrative law judge Megan McKenzie wrote in the emphatic ruling, which followed months of hearings. While non-binding, the opinion will inform regulators’ decision on whether or not to approve the deal.

“The Partners’ expertise is unlikely to provide a material benefit to Minnesota Power or its ratepayers,” the opinion says, adding that Global Infrastructure Partners’ private documents and communications with potential investors make clear that it is “planning on significant rate increases” that would surpass inflation and up the percentage of income ratepayers spend on utilities.

The prospective buyers and Allete rebutted the judge’s report, saying it was “not an accurate or balanced summary or analysis of the record” and that it “does not even attempt to provide a meaningful discussion of the evidence, arguments and counterarguments”.

In addition to the year-long rate freeze, the firms have agreed to lower their return on equity from 9.78% to 9.65%, the filing says, “resulting in immediate benefits for customers”.

Renewable energy

Allete has claimed the private equity firms “are aligned with the company’s vision of continuing to advance the State of Minnesota’s clean energy goals”. And in recent weeks, some clean energy advocates have also come out in support of the deal, saying it could provide Minnesota Power with the necessary capital to meet the state’s goal of decarbonizing its energy by 2040.

“The primary goal of the Acquisition is to equip the Company with reliable access to equity capital necessary to finance the investments in clean energy technologies,” Allete and the prospective buyers say.

But there is “significant risk” that Global Infrastructure Partners would not be willing or able to provide the capital needed to transition Minnesota Power away from fossil fuels, McKenzie wrote in her ruling. In fact, Allete is “planning significant capital spending on fossil fuels”, she wrote.

Global Infrastructure Partners often touts its focus on sustainability. “We aspire to be one of the world’s leading owners, developers, and operators of renewable energy assets,” its website says.

Yet the firm is a major investor in a south Texas gas terminal and other fossil fuel infrastructure, said Parr. When BlackRock acquired Global Infrastructure Partners, it more than doubled the number of fossil fuel companies in its portfolio, from nine to 22. This year, BlackRock also exited a group of asset managers committed to net zero investments amid political pressure.

Schuppert said she does not believe BlackRock is ideologically committed to either renewable energy or fossil fuels. “They’re committed to whatever makes them the most freaking money,” she said.

But even if the firm does advance renewable energy goals, if it does so at the expense of ratepayers’ energy bills. “That is not a win,” Schuppert said.

“That should be really concerning for people who say they want us to do decarbonization in a way that is equitable.”

If approved, the deal will also hamstring the public’s ability to control their electricity supply, said Yeakle, because though the state’s public utilities commission would still regulate Minnesota Power, its investors would have more control over its operations.

“It would further erode democracy and governance for the people by the people, by handing over political control,” she said. “We shouldn’t be further privatizing our crucial energy resource, adding more and more barriers to public oversight, to public transparency, to the public accessing the halls of power.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eedffcec284e87610fe94007d8069dab9aff996/234_0_3751_3000/master/3751.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c6fc1157aa7442747134b9ca2f344445",N,,2025-09-08 11:02:22.783244

The storm caused damage also in surrounding states, including Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas.","In the 1980s, there were 33 weather events that caused at least $1 billion in damages (inflation adjusted) — or 3.3 per year. With each decade passing, the yearly average of such events increases. In the 1990s, there were 5.7 such events per year on average, in the aughts the average was 6.7 per year, in the 2010s it was 13.1, and in the last three years it was 22 billion-dollar events per year, including 28 in 2023 — the most of any year.

Not only the number of events is increasing, but also the damages they are causing. If in the 1980s the annual cost of such disasters was about $18.4 billion, it reached nearly $99 billion per year in the 2010s, and a whopping $119.5 billion a year in the last three years. Also, since 2020, there have been 20 weather events that caused over $5 billion in damages. (Also see, Ranking the Most Powerful Hurricanes of All Time.)

To identify the weather disasters that cost five billion or more, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information report, Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters (2024). The 20 events are listed in order of the estimated cost of the damages, adjusted for inflation. Two of the events are winter storms, three are wildfires, four are droughts, five are severe storms, and six are tropical cyclones.

This post was updated on September 8, 2025 to clarify annualized costs of disasters, as well as specific death tolls.

Why This Matters

According to scientific studies, extreme weather events, including heat waves, large storms, flooding, drought, and others are likely to become more frequent or more intense as a result of climate change — human-induced rise in the global average temperature. With the U.S. being one of the wealthier countries, damages from extreme weather events are also more expensive (as opposed to less populated or less developed areas).

20. Hurricane Zeta

Duration: 10-28-2020 to 10-29-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.3 billion

Deaths: 6

Type: Tropical Cyclone

2020 was a historically active Atlantic hurricane season, and Zeta was the fifth to make landfall in Louisiana that season. Zeta made landfall on Oct. 28 at Cocodrie, as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph. As it went inland, the storm maintained some strength, and its wind affected parts of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, northern Georgia and the Carolinas.

19. Rockies Hail Storms and Central and Eastern Severe Weather

Duration: 06-21-2023 to 06-26-2023

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.4 billion

Deaths: 8

Type: Severe Storm

Severe hail storms across Colorado caused damage and injured approximately 100 people at a large outdoor concert. This severe weather also produced more than 60 tornadoes across portions of Wyoming, Colorado, Minnesota, Indiana, Kentucky, and Arkansas.

18. Western/Central Drought and Heat Wave

Duration: 06-01-2020 to 12-30-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.4 billion

Deaths: 45

Type: Drought

Widespread, continuous drought and record heat affected more than a dozen Western and Central states for much of the summer, fall, and into the winter months, causing considerable crop and livestock impacts. The high temperatures and lack of precipitation caused large D3 (extreme) and D4 (exceptional) drought coverage in December. Death Valley recorded a temperature of 130 degrees F — the highest measured temperature globally in decades — while Los Angeles county recorded a record high of 121 degrees F. The combined conditions dried out vegetation, contributing to the severity of the Western wildfire season.

17. Hawaii Firestorm

Duration: 08-08-2023 to 08-08-2023

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.7 billion

Deaths: 101, with roughly 31 still missing

Type: Wildfire

Wildfires destroyed the historic town of Lahaina on Maui Island of Hawaii. Winds were enhanced from a high-pressure system, which helped to exacerbate the wildfire, while Hurricane Dora was also south of Hawaii. The deadliest wildfire in the U.S. in over a century also destroyed thousands of homes and other property.

16. Hurricane Isaias

Duration: 08-03-2020 to 08-04-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.8 billion

Deaths: 16

Type: Tropical Cyclone

Isaias made landfall in southeastern North Carolina as a category 1 hurricane. The storm accelerated up the East Coast, resulting in widespread damage and power outages across New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. There was also considerable inland flooding, most notably in Pennsylvania. In addition, 34 tornadoes — including EF-2 and one EF-3 — developed across North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey due to Isaias.

15. Central Tornado Outbreak and Eastern Severe Weather

Duration: 03-31-2023 to 04-01-2023

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $5.9 billion

Deaths: 33

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $8.8 billion

Deaths: 5

Type: Tropical Cyclone

Sally made landfall in Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a Category 2 hurricane with wind gusts up to 100 mph and 20-30 inches of rainfall that caused considerable flood and wind damage across Alabama, the Florida panhandle, and into Georgia. Many homes and businesses in downtown Pensacola were impacted from flooding produced by storm surge and heavy rainfall.

11. Central and Eastern Winter Storm and Cold Wave

Duration: 12-21-2022 to 12-26-2022

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $8.9 billion

Deaths: 87

Type: Winter Storm

This winter storm and powerful arctic front impacted much of the nation, bringing heavy rains, snow, ice, low temperatures, and high winds. More than 200 million people were under a winter weather advisory or warning, and more than a million customers, from Texas to Maine, did not have power. Hurricane-force winds and continuous snow squalls shut down Buffalo, New York, and there were dozens of fatalities in the region as a result. Also, many homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure had extensive water damage from frozen pipes.

10. Western Drought and Heat Wave

Duration: 01-01-2021 to 12-31-2021

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $10.1 billion

Deaths: 229 (some sources state over 600)

Type: Drought

Drought conditions expanded and intensified throughout 2021 across many Western states. Conditions were exacerbated by a historic heat wave across the Pacific Northwest that broke several all-time high temperature records in the region. These extreme temperatures impacted several major cities and millions of people, causing hundreds of direct and indirect heat-related fatalities in Oregon and Washington. These conditions also rapidly dried out vegetation, impacting agriculture. Low water levels even forced a hydroelectric power plant to shut down.

9. Western Wildfires

Duration: 06-01-2021 to 12-31-2021

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $12.0 billion

Deaths: 8

Type: Wildfire

This western wildfire season came in the wake of severe drought conditions and periods of extreme heat. The wildfires mostly burned across California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Arizona. The Dixie Fire consumed over 960,000 acres — the second-largest in California. The fire also destroyed more than 1,000 structures. Other large wildfires burned in California and the states mentioned. Throughout the wildfire season, air quality was also a concern across numerous states.

8. Central Severe Weather – Derecho

Duration: 08-10-2020 to 08-10-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $13.3 billion

Deaths: 4

Type: Severe Storm

This powerful derecho — a specific type of long-lived wind storm — traveled 770 miles in 14 hours from southeast South Dakota to Ohio, producing winds greater than 100 mph. Millions of acres of corn and soybean crops were damaged across central Iowa. There was also heavy damage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Also, there were 15 tornadoes across northeastern Illinois, some affecting the Chicago metropolitan area. Other affected states included Minnesota, Indiana, and Ohio. Only one other severe storm since 1980 caused more damage — an outbreak of an estimated 343 tornadoes over central and southern states in April 2011 that caused $14.2 billion damages.

7. Southern/Midwestern Drought and Heatwave

Duration: 04-01-2023 to 09-30-2023

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $14.8 billion

Deaths: 247

Type: Drought

Drought conditions impacted especially the agriculture sector in numerous Southern and Midwestern states and surrounding states. There was damage to field crops, and feeding costs rose so high that ranchers had to sell livestock early. Low water levels of the Mississippi River have impacted river commerce and water quality in southern Louisiana.

6. Western Wildfires – California, Oregon, Washington Firestorms

Duration: 08-01-2020 to 12-30-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $19.9 billion

Deaths: 46

Type: Wildfire

A record-breaking U.S. wildfire season not only burned more than 10.2 million acres, but also produced hazardous air quality that affected millions of people for weeks. In California, the August Complex, the largest in the state, began as 37 separate wildfires within the Mendocino National Forest after storms caused lightning strikes. Approximately 10,500 structures were damaged or destroyed in the state. Oregon also had historic levels of wildfire damage, as over 2,000 structures burned, as did Colorado and Washington. Only two other wildfires were costlier — the Western Wildfires, California Firestorm of June-December 2017, which cost $23 billion, and the one the year after, which cost $30 billion.

5. Western/Central Drought and Heat Wave

Duration: 01-01-2022 to 12-31-2022

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $23.5 billion

Deaths: 136

Type: Drought

Severe drought conditions impacted many Western and Central states. Large reservoirs across the West, including Lake Mead — the nation’s largest reservoir — continued to be depleted, some nearing dead pool status or record-low levels. The drought affected crop production across many states and sharply increased feeding costs for livestock. Along the Mississippi River, many segments also experienced low water levels, affecting river commerce. Extreme heat caused more than 100 fatalities mainly in Arizona, Nevada, California, Oregon, and Texas.

4. Northwest, Central, Eastern Winter Storm and Cold Wave

Duration: 02-10-2021 to 02-19-2021

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $27.0 billion

Deaths: 246 (Some studies suggest 700+ indirect deaths)

Type: Winter Storm

A historic cold wave and winter storm impacted many northwest, central, and eastern states. But while northern states are set up to deal with such weather, southern states — from Nebraska southward to Texas — were caught trying to deal with temperatures that were considerably below normal, including multiple days of sustained below-freezing temperatures. The prolonged arctic air caused widespread power outages in Texas and other southern states, and water damage from frozen pipes.

These extreme conditions also caused or contributed to the direct and indirect deaths of more than 210 people in Texas alone. States including Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington dealt with snow and ice. No other winter storm on record in the U.S. was more costly.

3. Hurricane Laura

Duration: 08-27-2020 to 08-28-2020

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $28.1 billion

Deaths: 42

Type: Tropical Cyclone

Laura made landfall at Cameron Parish in southwestern Louisiana as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 27. With winds up to 150 mph and storm surge in excess of 15 feet, damage to coastal communities and inland to the city of Lake Charles was significant. The electrical grid in southern Louisiana was also damaged. The storm caused damage also in surrounding states, including Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas.

2. Hurricane Ida

Duration: 08-29-2021 to 09-01-2021

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $78.7 billion

Deaths: 96

Type: Tropical Cyclone

Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph and a minimum central pressure of 930 millibars. Damage to the energy infrastructure across southern Louisiana caused widespread, long — in some parts nearly week-long — power outages to millions of people. As Ida moved into the Northeast it merged with a frontal system, creating severe weather and flash flooding across a wide region from eastern Pennsylvania to New York that caused significant damage.

1. Hurricane Ian

Duration: 09-28-2022 to 09-30-2022

Estimated inflation-adjusted cost: $118.5 billion

Deaths: 161

Type: Tropical Cyclone

Hurricane Ian made landfall near Cayo Costa, Florida, as a Category 4 Hurricane with sustained winds of 150 mph. Parts of many coastal communities, including several barrier islands, were washed away by the high winds and storm surge. Ian also caused significant flooding inland Florida. After turning into a tropical storm, Ian re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and made landfall near Georgetown, South Caroline on Sept. 30 with sustained winds of 85 mph, causing more coastal flood damage.

Only a handful of weather events since 1980 were more costly.

“Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid,” she added.

The statement comes soon after a report by Reuters noting that power generation developers were betting on natural gas, hydro, and nuclear to supply reliable, meaning dispatchable, electricity to U.S. consumers as opposed to solar and wind, which are intermittent generators.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act contains stipulations about a deadline for subsidies for new wind and solar capacity. This caused a wave of criticism from the solar industry despite claims for years that solar did not need subsidies to survive and grow. Indeed, SEIA’s Ross Hopper added in her statement from today that “no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.”

The presence of strong market demand should offset the effect of any federal policies with regard to financial incentives and the solar industry now has the chance to prove it can, indeed, survive and thrive even without subsidies.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects.
The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain.
Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.
Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.

This is the nation’s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port — enough to power up to 60,000 homes.

Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a “game changer in terms of clean energy production” for the port and the communities around it. America’s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.

“We’re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,” she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project’s power station.

An emerging industry, but plenty of power to tap

Wave energy is an emerging industry that’s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.

Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America’s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port’s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.

“It’s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,” said Rémi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. “It’s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.”

Filling in gaps for wind and solar

A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.

But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.

The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

“The world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,” Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.

“And we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,” he said.

Company says plenty of sites can work for wave power

Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn’t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.

The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.

Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power’s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.

“We consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,” said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

The nuclear energy field is now “in a hype bubble that is driving unrealistic expectations,” said Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization that has long acted as a nuclear safety watchdog.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to advance nuclear energy by weakening the NRC, Lyman said.
In the last couple of decades, dozens of nuclear energy companies have emerged, including TerraPower, co-founded by Bill Gates.
“I am quite, I would say, on the pessimistic scale when it comes to the future of nuclear energy in the U.S.”","In May, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to facilitate the construction of nuclear reactors and the development of nuclear energy technology; the orders aim to cut red tape, ease approval processes, and reshape the role of the main regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC. These moves, the administration said, were part of an effort to achieve American independence from foreign power providers by way of a “nuclear energy renaissance.”

Self-reliance isn’t the only factor motivating nuclear power proponents outside of the administration: Following a decades-long trend away from nuclear energy, in part due to safety concerns and high costs, the technology has emerged as a potential option to try to mitigate climate change. Through nuclear fission, in which atoms are split to release energy, reactors don’t emit any greenhouse gases.

The Trump administration wants to quadruple the nuclear sector’s domestic energy production, with the goal of producing 400 gigawatts by 2050. To help achieve that goal, scientific institutions like the Idaho National Laboratory, a leading research institute in nuclear energy, are pushing forward innovations such as more efficient types of fuel. Companies are also investing millions of dollars to develop their own nuclear reactor designs, a move from industry that was previously unheard of in the nuclear sector. For example, Westinghouse, a Pennsylvania-based nuclear power company, plans to build 10 new large reactors to help achieve the 2050 goal.

However, the road to renaissance is filled with familiar obstacles. Nuclear energy infrastructure is “too expensive to build, and it takes too long to build,” said Allison Macfarlane, a science and technology policy expert at the University of British Columbia who used to chair the NRC from 2012 to 2014.

And experts are divided on whether new nuclear technologies, such as small versions of reactors, are ready for primetime. The nuclear energy field is now “in a hype bubble that is driving unrealistic expectations,” said Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization that has long acted as a nuclear safety watchdog.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to advance nuclear energy by weakening the NRC, Lyman said. “The message is that it’s regulation that has been the obstacle to deploying nuclear power, and if we just get rid of all this red tape, then the industry is going to thrive,” he added. “I think that’s really misplaced.”

Although streamlining the approval process might accelerate development, the true problem lies in the high costs of nuclear, which would need to be significantly cheaper to compete with other sources of energy such as natural gas, said Koroush Shirvan, a nuclear science researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Even the license-ready reactors are still not economical,” he said. If the newer reactor technologies do pan out, without government support and subsidies, Shirvan said, it is difficult to imagine them “coming online before 2035.”

Rumblings of a nuclear renaissance give experts a sense of déjà vu. The first resurgence in interest was around 2005, when many thought that nuclear energy could mitigate climate change and be an energy alternative to dwindling supply and rising prices of fossil fuels. But that enthusiasm slowed mainly after the Fukushima accident in 2011, in which a tsunami-triggered power outage — along with multiple safety failures — led to a nuclear meltdown at a facility in Japan. “So, the first nuclear renaissance fizzled out,” said Lyman.

Globally, the proportion of electricity provided by nuclear energy has been dwindling. Although there has been an increase in generation, nuclear energy has contributed less to the share of global electricity demand, dropping to 9 percent in 2024 from a peak of about 17 percent in 2001. In the U.S., 94 reactors generate about a fifth of the nation’s electricity, a proportion that has held steady since 1990s. But only two of those reactors have come online in the last nearly 30 years.

This renewed push is “a second bite at the apple, and we’ll have to see but it does seem to have a lot more of a headwind now,” said Lyman.

Much of that movement comes from the private sector, said Todd Allen, a nuclear engineer at the University of Michigan. In the last couple of decades, dozens of nuclear energy companies have emerged, including TerraPower, co-founded by Bill Gates. “It feels more like normal capitalism than we ever had in nuclear,” Allen said. Those companies are working on developing the large reactors that have been the backbone of nuclear energy for decades, as well as newer technologies that can bolster the field.

Proponents say small modular reactors, or SMRs, and microreactors, which generate less than 300 megawatts and 20 megawatts, respectively, could offer safer, cheaper, and more flexible energy compared to their more traditional counterparts. (Large reactors have, on average, 900 megawatts of capacity.)One 2022 study found that modularization can reduce construction time by up to 60 percent.

These designs have taken the spotlight: In 2024, a report estimated that the SMR market would reach $295 billion by 2043. In June, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Congress that DOE will have at least three SMRs running by July of next year. And in July of this year, the Nuclear Energy Agency launched a dashboard to track SMR technologies around the world, which identified 74 SMR designs at different stages around the world. The first commercial SMR in North America is currently being constructed in Canada, with plans to be operational by 2030.

But whether SMRs and microreactors are actually safer and more cost-effective remains to be determined. A 2022 study found that SMRs would likely produce more leakage and nuclear waste than conventional reactors. Studying them, though, is difficult since so few are currently operational.

In part, that may be because of cost. Multiple analyses have concluded that, because of rising construction and operating costs, SMRs might not be financially viable enough to compete for the world’s energy markets, including in developing countries that lack affordable access to electricity.

And recent ventures have hit road bumps: For example, NuScale, the only SMR developer with a design approved by the NRC, had to shut down their operations in November 2023 due to increasingly high costs (though another uprated SMR design was approved earlier this year).

“Nothing is really commercialized yet,” said Macfarlane. Most of the tech companies haven’t figured out expenses, supply chains, the kind of waste they are going to produce or security at their reactors, she added.

Fuel supply is also a barrier since most plants use uranium enriched at low rates, but SMRs and microreactors use uranium enriched at higher levels, which is typically sourced from Russia and not commercially available in the U.S. So scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory are working to recover enriched uranium from existing reactors and developed new, more cost-effective fuels, said Jess Gehin, the associate laboratory director for the Nuclear Science & Technology Directorate at the INL. They are also using artificial intelligence and modeling simulation tools and capabilities to optimize nuclear energy systems, he added: “We got to reach 400 gigawatts, we need to accelerate all of this.”

Companies are determined to face and surpass these barriers. Some have begun pouring concrete, such as one nuclear company called Kairos Power that began building a demo of their SMR design in Tennessee; the plant is projected to be fully operational by 2027. “I would make the case that we’re moving faster than many in the field, if not the fastest,” Mike Laufer, the company’s CEO and co-founder, told Reuters last year.

Some experts think achieving nuclear expansion can be done — and revel in the progress so far: “I would have never thought we’d be in this position where we’re working so hard to expand nuclear, because for most of my career, it wasn’t that way,” said Gehin. “And I would say each month that goes by exceeds my expectations on the next bigger things that are coming.”

Although the Trump administration aims to accelerate nuclear energy through executive orders, in practice, it has not allocated new funding yet, said Matt Bowen, an expert on nuclear energy, waste, and nonproliferation at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. In fact, the initial White House budget proposed cutting $4.7 billion from the Department of Energy including $408 million from the Office of Nuclear Energy allocated for nuclear research in the 2026 fiscal year.

“The administration was proposing cuts to Office of Nuclear Energy and DOE more broadly, and DOGE is pushing staff out,” said Bowen. “How you do more with less? Less staff, less money.”

The Trump administration places the blame for the nuclear sector’s stagnation on the NRC, which oversees licensing and recertification processes that cost the industry millions of dollars each year in compliance. In his executive orders, Trump called for a major reorganization of the NRC. Some of the proposed changes, like streamlining the approval process (which can take years for new plants), may be welcomed because “for a long time, they were very, very, very slow,” said Charles Forsberg, a nuclear chemical engineer at MIT. But there are worries that the executive orders could do more than cut red tape.

“Every word in those orders is of concern, because the thrust of those orders is to essentially strip the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of its independence from the executive branch, essentially nullifying the original purpose,” said Lyman.

Some experts fear that with these new constraints, NRC staff will have less time and fewer resources to do their jobs, which could impact power plant safety in the future, Bowen said: “This notion that the problem for nuclear energy is regulation, and so all we need to do is deregulate, is both wrong and also really problematic.”

The next few decades will tell whether nuclear, especially SMRs, can overcome economic and technical challenges to safely contribute to decarbonization efforts. Some, like Gehin, are optimistic. “I think we’re going to accelerate,” he said. “We certainly can achieve a dramatic deployment if we put our mindset to it.”

But making nuclear financially competitive will take serious commitment from the government and the dozens of companies, with many still skeptical, Shirvan said. “I am quite, I would say, on the pessimistic scale when it comes to the future of nuclear energy in the U.S.”",https://undark.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2185985212_crop.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:20:14.436858

The groundbreaking drew major attention, raising expectations that the state would soon host its first large-scale car manufacturing facility.

Since then, however, momentum has faded. In mid-2024, the Vietnamese automaker disclosed that production at the Moncure site would not begin until 2028, pushing the schedule back several years. Aside from early site preparations, little visible development has moved forward, leaving the ambitious project on hold while the company reassesses its rollout.

The extended delay has tempered early optimism, turning what was once hailed as a transformational project into a long wait for progress. But there is renewed hope for VinFast’s stalled North Carolina project as another long-delayed investment — Red Bull’s $1.5 billion beverage campus in Concord — finally breaks ground.

Ford CEO Jim Farley summed up the effect of the new regulations when he commented that the change “has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years.” Detroit has recently backed away from EV manufacturing, which had made automakers retool much of their companies to, among other things, compete with Tesla. That goal will become much less important.

The change comes at about the same time that the Trump administration cut the $7,500 tax credit that came from EV purchases. There has been anxiety that, after this expired on September 30, EV sales would crater. There had already been doubt that Americans were buying EVs in rising numbers. Ford’s overall U.S. EV sales have been about 4% of all unit sales through the first eight months of the year.

The change also comes at a point when gasoline prices have fallen sharply over the past five years. This gives drivers another reason to stay away from EVs. Tight refinery production and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushed the average price of a gallon of regular nationwide to $5.10 in July 2022. The AAA Fuel Price tracker put that number at $3.20 yesterday. As crude prices continue to fall, that number could go lower.

Ford said it would lose $5 billion this year in its EV unit. It has already invested billions in its quest to be a major EV force in America. The need to race toward that target has become much less important.

The 2025 update to the USGS critical minerals list and the methodology underpinning it provide a clear, quantifiable basis for prioritization.
Unless policymakers integrate the noneconomic values of these minerals, we risk a US critical minerals strategy that misses the forest for the trees.","Since 2016, the United States has sought to reduce its economic and national security vulnerabilities related to critical minerals, a broad grouping of minerals important for industry and national defense, that the United States is highly import dependent upon and/or that have fragile domestic supply chains. This import dependence renders the US economy vulnerable to supply disruptions, coercion by suppliers, and even natural disasters at home . The US Geological Survey (USGS) publishes a list of the critical minerals it deems vital to the US economy and national security to guide related federal policy decisions, such as on mining investments, tax incentives, and mining permits. In 2022, the USGS listed 50 minerals. The 2025 draft lists 54, including copper, silicon, lithium, and zirconium.

I’ve argued before that the US critical minerals strategy needs clearer priorities . With a revised methodology informing the 2025 USGS draft list, we now have a firm basis for prioritization—with two important caveats: The monetary benchmark for inclusion on economic grounds is too low, and the list does not explicitly consider environmental or national security needs—which are the ultimate goals critical US mineral policy is meant to address.

What are critical minerals, and how do they become “critical”?

Interest in critical minerals—a term that entered the modern lexicon in 2017 —rose steadily in the 2020s before exploding in 2025. Associated in the popular imagination with energy transition–intensive materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, the term “critical mineral” also covers heavy rare earth elements used in semiconductors and national security applications . More broadly, it refers to minerals for which the United States is highly import dependent and/or susceptible to a single point of failure (SPOF, i.e., one facility closes and the whole supply chain stops) in its US domestic supply chain .

Critical minerals have loomed large in the second Trump administration’s foreign policy: They have been central to trade talks with China and the subject of weaponized Chinese export controls , US attempts to broker peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo , US negotiations to continue supporting Ukraine’s war effort , and Trump’s covetous stance toward Greenland . Through now three congressionally mandated updates, the list has included materials with common uses such as aluminum and others with such rarified uses (such as rhenium) that even specialists may not have heard of them. Critical mineral status matters because it unlocks a suite of US government interventions, including Defense Production Act–related benefits, tax credits for domestic production and refining, and national stockpiling.

The new methodology is a departure from past practice. The 2022 list relied mainly on supply concentration, trade reliance, and import dependence metrics, which flagged minerals as critical if the United States was highly reliant on a small number of suppliers. In contrast, the 2025 methodology models probability-weighted GDP losses from (1,200 different) simulated one-year supply disruptions, producing an explicit economic risk expressed as projected losses to US GDP. It thus moves from static reliance indicators to a scenario-based, impact-driven framework.

The new operational definition of a critical mineral is now one for which a probability-adjusted one-year import supply disruption or domestic SPOF would result in a GDP loss of at least $2 million.

This new methodology is a massive improvement over earlier iterations. It refocuses attention on actual impacts versus theoretical exposure, its probabilistic approach to supply disruptions does not default to worst-case scenarios, and it facilitates cost-benefit analysis. But the resulting list is still overly inclusive and subject to the perennial challenge of accounting for externalities.

The list is too long—but helps establish clear priorities

The $2 million GDP loss estimate cutoff amount is a lot of money in many contexts but not relative to the US economy. US GDP is presently $30.35 trillion a year; a $2 million loss would constitute 7 millionths of 1 percent of annual GDP. For a sense of scale, these are losses typically associated with a medium-sized restaurant fire . There are thousands of such fires in the United States annually, and they are not discussed—even their combined impact—as if they were consequential to the macroeconomy. The table below demonstrates how the 2025 list—currently 54 minerals long—shrinks significantly at higher economic impact thresholds. At amounts exceeding $1 billion, the list comprises just six minerals—samarium, rhodium, lutetium, terbium, dysprosium, and gallium—all of which are small-volume inputs that enable massive downstream industries: defense, semiconductors, medical imaging, and electric vehicles. At amounts exceeding $500 million, the list would comprise nine; at greater than $100 million, just 20.

Critical minerals on USGS 2025 draft list ranked by impact on US GDP if subject to a one-year, probability-adjusted supply disruption $1 billion or greater $500 million or greater $100 million or greater Samarium Samarium Samarium Rhodium Rhodium Rhodium Lutetium Lutetium Lutetium Terbium Terbium Terbium Dysprosium Dysprosium Dysprosium Gallium Gallium Gallium Germanium Germanium Gadolinium Gadolinium Tungsten Tungsten Niobium Magnesium Yttrium Potash Hafnium Aluminum Thulium Neodymium Silicon ferroalloys Antimony Barite Source: US Geological Survey (2025).

This distinction is important for prioritizing scarce resources. While the new USGS methodology ranks minerals according to economic risk, most of the legislative and executive perks tied to the “critical” designation—tax credits, accelerated permitting, and Defense Production Act–related benefits—are binary: A mineral is either on the list or it isn’t. That is, for most policy purposes samarium (with an average modeled GDP loss of $4.5 billion) and chromium chemicals ($2 million) are on equal footing. The USGS methodology produces a continuum of criticality; the policy environment treats it as an on/off switch. The 2025 methodology acknowledges this, offering a “statistical risk” categorization ranging from “high” to “elevated” and “moderate” to “limited.” But the “high” category still includes materials (like potash and rhodium) whose economic impacts differ by an order of magnitude.

Accounting for externalities

“Don’t talk price until you’ve established value” is an oft-mentioned key to success in sales. The new methodology establishes the price of disruption but does not consider harder-to-model nonmonetary values.

This challenge is most evident in two areas: renewable energy and national defense. The value propositions of renewable energy and national security far surpass their economic contributions to GDP. The modeled cost of a lithium supply disruption from China is $34 million. But this does not account for the noneconomic benefits of downstream technologies like lithium-ion batteries, which enable us to live mobile-yet-digitally-connected lives and transition to renewable energy.

To the extent that a supply disruption were to slow US clean energy adoption and electric vehicle sales, it would slow adoption of technologies that produced air-quality and health benefits valued at $249 billion (2019–22) and prevented 1,200 to 1,600 premature deaths in 2022 alone. These kinds of considerations do not inform the USGS methodology because the model only accounts for market-mediated GDP losses as represented in input-output tables.

The same logic holds for national security. Two-inch gallium nitride (GaN) substrate—the base layer for building epitaxial semiconductor films used in advanced radar arrays and lasers—may only cost about $1,300 a piece, but the US Navy’s AN/SPY-6 advanced radar system (unit cost approximately $90 million to $100 million) cannot provide its essential function of air and missile tracking without it. Given the importance of these downstream systems, the higher costs would be eaten—demand is price inelastic.

But demand for other systems that depend on critical minerals—like precision-guided munitions, drones, and night vision goggles—is more price elastic. One fewer set of night vision goggles deployed might not sound consequential—but tell that to the spouse of a soldier killed during a nighttime ambush. Focusing narrowly on GDP losses risks misunderstanding the true importance of materials whose principal value is in providing national security or mitigating climate change.

These criticisms seem logically inconsistent: Pricing is good, but pricing doesn’t give us the whole picture. But they point in the same direction: revising the methodology to attempt to price—or at least value—these positive externalities and/or the avoidance of negative ones. A layer of analysis that accounts for health, environmental, and security externalities—using Environmental Protection Agency assessments of avoided mortality and Department of Defense assessments of mission risk, for example—could augment the new (as of 2025) approach.

The 2025 update to the USGS critical minerals list and the methodology underpinning it provide a clear, quantifiable basis for prioritization. But this clarity comes at the cost of undervaluing the noneconomic contributions of these minerals to our shared prosperity, safety, and health. Unless policymakers integrate the noneconomic values of these minerals, we risk a US critical minerals strategy that misses the forest for the trees.

Notes

1. This is true in a technical sense. Dating back to World War I, the United States has monitored a list of “war minerals” to support the war effort. The term ""critical mineral"" became the standard term used by the USGS in 2017.

2. Global production of aluminum was around 72 million metric tons in 2024; for rhenium, it was 62 MT. One of the densest materials known to humanity, 62 MT of pure rhenium would be about the size of a standard home refrigerator. See USGS mineral commodity summaries for 2025.

3. To account for some scenarios being more plausible and probable than others.

4. The distinction about prices is important because, in theory, a foreign supply shock could result in a net benefit to the US economy if the commodity is exported at higher global prices.

5. It should go without saying that they are still consequential for the communities where they occur and their owners and employees.",https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/2025-09/DPAF231101X99X779255.JPG,N,,2025-09-08 12:20:35.683352

If you’re having a case of déjà vu, it’s not you – GM already announced back in July it’s shifting the Orion Township assembly plant from EVs as previously planned to gas-powered trucks and SUVs.

Here’s how to spot a lemon car.

This time around, the auto giant says it’s taking a few more measures to pull back from the electric car market as demand cools. We’ve been seeing similar things from other automakers, so this is hardly just a GM strategy.

For starters, Chevy Bolt production begins again in late 2025 in Kansas. However, the factory will only have one shift, so it’s not going to be pumping out a ton of cars.

A GM spokesman says the automaker is anticipating adding a second shift sometime in 2026, so the company obviously thinks demand will improve for some reason.

In addition, for the entire month of December and the week of October 10 plus the week of Thanksgiving, GM plans to halt all production at its Spring Hill, Tennessee plant. That’s the home of the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq, plus the Cadillac XT5.

For 2026, the Spring Hill plant will come back online, but with only a single shift all the way until May 2026. The current second shift will be added back, showing that GM predicts demand will be soft until around then.

There are a few reasons why the EV market is softening. It was already in decline last year, but with President Trump coming into office and ending the electric car mandates, that has made many car shoppers reconsider their options.

Automakers are no longer getting millions or more from taxpayers just for making electric vehicles, something that was a popular gift during the Biden Administration through the Department of Energy.

And the federal EV tax credits are going away at the end of the month. That has caused a run on electric cars, but it means moving into October and beyond demand should crater.

Energy Secretary Christopher Wright submitted the request on Aug. 29 under Section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, a rarely used provision that allows the DOE to propose rules or policy changes within FERC’s jurisdiction. If rescinded, FERC would need to open a new docket and build a new record before considering similar policy changes again.

The draft policy statement, first developed in 2018 and expanded in 2021, would have required FERC to weigh environmental impacts and greenhouse gas emissions when determining whether pipeline projects meet the public interest under the Natural Gas Act. It was reclassified as a draft in March 2022 following political pushback and has remained inactive since.

“This proposal seeks to eliminate uncertainty for natural gas infrastructure development,” Wright argued, calling the draft policy inconsistent with statutory authority under the Natural Gas Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

Section 403 authority has been invoked only a handful of times, most recently in 2017 when former Secretary Rick Perry sought new rules to support coal and nuclear plants. Wright’s request differs in that it seeks rescission rather than adoption of a new rule.

FERC has noticed the request and will accept public comments through Sept. 9. The agency is expected to act by Sept. 30, though timing may depend on the confirmation of pending commissioner nominees.

While the move would not immediately change FERC’s current reliance on its 1999 Certificate Policy Statement, it signals that the DOE may play a more assertive role in shaping pipeline policy going forward.

The report found that DC fast chargers charge an EV battery quickly, but these chargers are harder on battery life.
Before the people of Michigan give more money to build EV chargers, they need answers to what happened to that money.
A sparse EV charging network probably isn’t even in the top 20 problems that Michigan residents face daily, Outman said.
These include the Michigan Department of Transportation, Michigan Public Service Commission, Southeast Michigan Council of Government, and the city of Detroit.","When you’re driving an electric vehicle, you may worry about where the next charger is. Researchers at Michigan State University say a solution to that is possible, at a cost of nearly $1 billion.

It costs between $50,000 and $80,000 to build a single charger, according to a 53-page taxpayer-funded study, which says the state needs to spend $1 billion on about 97,000 electric vehicle chargers. The report did not look at chargers in single family homes or other residential settings and thus excludes the cost of installing them.

There are 82,000 electric vehicles registered in Michigan, far short of an official goal of 2 million.

Mehrnaz Ghamami and Ali Zockaie, associate professors in Michigan State University’s College of Engineering, have studied Michiganders’ travel patterns using data provided by the Michigan Department of Transportation.

“We are considering things like making sure that our users won’t have to go out of their way to find a charging station or face significant delays while waiting for an available charger,” said Ghamami in a press release from Michigan State. “It’s not just the investment that we are considering, but also the EV users; we want to make sure every single EV trip is feasible.”

EV batteries perform worse in the winter, the authors note, which contributes to the need for more frequent charging and perhaps more chargers.

“Electric vehicle battery performance drops 30% efficiency in winter,” said Ghamami. “So, we ran different scenarios by comparing charging needs in summer to winter, in which battery performance is 70% of what it is in summer.”

Tourism also will increase the number of charging stations Michigan needs, the report said. The report found that DC fast chargers charge an EV battery quickly, but these chargers are harder on battery life.

“These findings from Michigan State University’s research reinforces [sic] our commitment to a smart, data-driven approach to expanding Michigan’s EV infrastructure,” said Michigan’s Chief Mobility Officer Justine Johnson, per the MSU press release. “Understanding how and when EV users travel ensures we can build out Michigan’s mobility ecosystem and increase charging access for users across the state. In Michigan, we will continue to lead through our innovative measures to accelerate the transition to electric mobility and supporting the needs of all Michiganders.”

The Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity and the Michigan Office of Future Mobility and Electrification funded the study.

In 2023, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids made up 0.76% of vehicles in Michigan, compared to 4.85% in California and 1.52% nationwide, the report said.

The state is 1.9 million electric vehicles behind its 2030 goal.

“The total infrastructure cost to support all EV trips based on 25% market share in Michigan is estimated at $998 million, including $677 million for DC fast chargers and $321 million for (slower) Level 2 chargers. These costs include the cost of chargers as well as associated expenses such as grid infrastructure, construction, and land,” the report said.

The state has allocated millions of dollars to build chargers, said Rep. Pat Outman, R-Six Lakes, chairman of the Michigan House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Before the people of Michigan give more money to build EV chargers, they need answers to what happened to that money.

""When you’re talking about a billion dollars, the state deserves answers about why it failed to build chargers with the original $30 million allocated to build chargers,” Outman told Michigan Capitol Confidential in a phone interview.

Whitmer’s 2025 budget pitched $85 million in subsidies for electric vehicles, including $25 million for EV charging stations at multifamily complexes and commercial parking lots, $20 million to transition government fleets to EVs and hydrogen vehicles, and $10 million to transition the state fleet from internal combustion engines to EVs.

A sparse EV charging network probably isn’t even in the top 20 problems that Michigan residents face daily, Outman said. “I’m more concerned about long-term sustainable road funding, infrastructure needs, labor, issues, population issues,” he told CapCon. “Just with the cost of living nowadays days, Michigan families are already paying record high taxes to Lansing. Before we ask for billions more, the government needs to prove it can responsibly manage the money it already has. If $30 million did in fact lead to zero chargers, then why should anyone believe that $1 billion would be any better?”

Most people who own electric vehicles are male and earn nearly $200,000 annually, own a home, own multiple vehicles and have access to home charging, according to a 2021 MIT Science Policy Review article. Charger subsidies, according to Outman, would force Michiganders to pay for the lifestyles of the rich.

“These are wealthier, well-off people who are going out there and buying electric vehicles, and we’re just subsidizing that with taxpayer dollars,” Outman said. “It’s just ridiculous.”

The biggest barriers to EV adoption are the high upfront cost, range anxiety (running out of battery power while far from a charging station) and a sparse charging network.

The report says that people hesitate to buy EVs because of what it calls “perceived limitations.”

In the race to harness the power of the stars, magnetic confinement fusion approaches have long grappled with the challenge of containing plasma at temperatures hotter than the sun. For decades, superconducting magnets made from copper conductors or niobium-alloy-based low-temperature superconductors (LTS) were the backbone of any fusion reactor design. But the emergence of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes on the production floor over the course of the last decade has sparked a breakthrough in fusion magnet performance.

HTS tapes transforming the fusion landscape

HTS tapes, based on multi-crystalline REBCO (rare-earth barium copper oxide) layers, can carry immense electrical currents while operating at significantly higher temperatures and magnetic fields than their LTS counterparts. The commercial advent of this material has enabled the design of more compact, efficient, and powerful fusion reactors. With HTS-based fusion magnets, magnetic fields exceeding 20 T are now achievable. Roughly speaking, doubling the magnetic field in a tokamak or stellarator device leads to a 40-fold reduction in reactor volume without sacrificing output. This has lowered the cost and complexity of fusion prototypes, accelerating timelines for the commercial viability of clean fusion energy.

The scale-up of high-temperature superconductor (HTS) production is critical to unlocking the potential of magnetic fusion energy. With nearly $10bn in mostly private funding, the fusion industry is rapidly advancing toward commercialisation. According to the latest report from the Fusion Industry Association, of the 50+ fusion companies, 25 companies follow a magnetic confinement fusion approach, and 75% of all fusion companies expect to begin delivering electricity to the grid by 2035.

Achieving this milestone will require the construction of many HTS-based magnetic fusion devices, consuming large amounts of HTS tape that easily exceeds the global HTS tape capacity currently at around 10,000 km per year by an order of magnitude.

Growing crystalline thin films by the metre

In HTS tape manufacturing, the superconducting properties of a tape are largely determined by the quality of its few microns-thin REBCO layer, which is to be grown consecutively on tape substrates of several hundred metres up to a kilometre in length.

Various chemical and physical deposition methods, such as Chemical Solution Deposition, Chemical Vapour Deposition, Magnetron Sputtering, Electron Beam Deposition and Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) using excimer lasers, have been employed in the pursuit of achieving smooth and homogeneous REBCO films with well-aligned crystal grains and with good adherence to the adjacent material layers.

Standing out from the crowd, PLD-deposited REBCO-films exhibit an intrinsic growth structure which lends itself to superior critical current density under high fields up to 20 T and beyond. Today, PLD is the dominating REBCO manufacturing method serving all types of HTS-based fusion magnets as well as high-field magnet coils in high-resolution NMR spectrometers.

PLD rising to the occasion

PLD has long been known as an excellent method for growing high-quality oxide films on sub-square centimetre-sized substrates. To this day, thousands of excimer laser-based PLD systems are used for a few hours per day with single-digit pulse frequency in material research labs. The advent of HTS-based fusion less than a decade ago has sparked an unprecedented demand for PLD-REBCO films, where a single prototype reactor alone may consume 10,000 kilometres of typically 4 mm wide tape material. This corresponds to a total REBCO film deposition area of 40,000 m² – roughly the size of six soccer fields.

Enter the LEAP excimer laser platform

The Coherent LEAP excimer laser platform, designed for fast large-area thin film processing, has been following this demand with increasing power levels up to 300 W at the required output wavelength of 308 nm and is now employed by all major HTS tape suppliers. To scale up tape manufacturing capacity, new fabs have been built, housing multiple LEAP 300 W-based PLD systems operating at maximum intensity and at an annual capacity of several 1000 km of HTS tape. As HTS-tape demand is expected to soar with the next wave of prototype and grid-scale fusion reactors already projected, the next generation LEAP at 600 W has been introduced in June 2025 at the Laser World of Photonics Fair in Munich. With its core innovations, performance and lifetime improvements, LEAP 600 W is the most cost-effective PLD laser on the market.

LEAP 600 – A big leap toward grid energy reactors

As PLD is the rate and performance-determining process step on the HTS tape production floor, the LEAP 600 W is poised to become the linchpin of the imminent global HTS tape capacity expansion.

The LEAP 600C is a cutting-edge 600-watt excimer laser developed and produced at the Coherent excimer laser facility in Goettingen, Germany. It operates at a 308 nm wavelength and is specifically designed for industrial-scale HTS tape fabrication.

The LEAP 600 C excimer laser features on-the-fly active injection technology, which triples runtime and doubles the HTS tape throughput per PLD system compared to previous LEAP 300 W-based REBCO deposition systems.

Until now, scaling HTS tape production is still regarded by many fusion companies as a bottleneck to achieving their next fusion reactor milestones due to the limited capacity. The LEAP 600 has been introduced to the HTS tape market, with a clear focus on changing this picture.

Equally important as the next level of capacity scaling of the game-changing HTS tapes, the fusion industry needs to meet energy cost targets set by existing coal, gas and nuclear power plants. As the magnets make up for a large part of the reactor costs, in the next wave of grid reactor magnets, HTS tape procurement will be guided significantly by the performance-price ratio.

With these fusion market economics in mind, the LEAP 600 has been designed to provide unprecedented cost-efficiency and offers not only the highest power but also the lowest cost-per-watt-ratio of the LEAP excimer laser product family.

To this end, innovative developments such as on-the-fly active gas injections significantly extend the intervals between gas replacements in the LEAP 600, which the operator must conduct on a regular basis. Therefore, significantly longer batch lengths and more consecutive batches can now be achieved between the gas exchanges.

Although the laser-related expenses are but a smaller fraction in the HTS tape manufacturing cost pie chart, innovations like this are essential steps in the right direction toward supply chain readiness and putting commercial HTS-based magnetic fusion reactors as early as possible on the power grid.

Fusion and beyond – the look ahead

HTS tapes with their ongoing commoditisation via PLD-driven upscaling are poised to reshape our future in several transformative ways – first and foremost through their role in making magnetic confinement fusion more efficient and economically viable. If successful, fusion will provide virtually limitless, carbon-free energy, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. Thanks to HTS tapes, fusion machines can be built smaller and closer to where energy is needed—urban centres, industrial zones, or remote areas. This decentralisation could revolutionise energy infrastructure and resilience.

HTS tapes are not only advancing fusion as the holy grail of energy generation, but soon will push boundaries in energy distribution via superconducting high-voltage cables and multiple other superconducting grid components, which today are copper-based and suffer from transmission losses and inefficiencies.

Also, in a multitude of other application fields like accelerator magnets in particle physics, medical and biological imaging (MRI/NMR), HTS tapes enable cost-effective and energy-efficient system advances as opposed to traditional low-temperature superconductors.

Transportation is another area which will strongly benefit from employing HTS tapes. From ultra-fast, frictionless travel via Maglev trains powered by HTS magnets to electric aircraft and ships driven by lightweight, high-efficiency HTS motors.

In summary, HTS tapes have the potential to revolutionise our world by enabling technologies that were previously limited by energy inefficiency, size, or cost. The superconducting transformation of the world has already begun. Many hundreds of thousands of kilometres of HTS tape must be produced on the road ahead. The LEAP 600, in conjunction with sophisticated three-shift PLD system technology, will be central to success.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Image-1-1024x576.png,N,,2025-09-08 11:03:44.801236

Toward the end of 2024, Arevon began operations at its Vikings Solar-plus-Storage Project in Imperial County, California. The $529 million project, which is one of the first utility-scale solar peaker plants in the U.S., combines 157 MWdc of solar with 150 MW/600 megawatt hours (MWh) of battery storage, shifting low-cost daytime solar energy to higher-cost peak demand periods in late afternoons and evenings. Vikings's financial close was regarded as the nation's first utility-scale solar peaker plant to leverage tax credit transferability and was recognized by receiving IJGlobal's Renewables Deal of the Year – Energy Storage Award.

Also among Arevon's significant achievements was the August 2025 completion of its $2 billion Eland 1 & 2 Solar-plus-Storage Project in Kern County, California. Now fully operational, Eland delivers 758 MWdc of solar generation paired with 300 MW/1,200 MWh of energy storage, making it one of the largest installations of its kind in the nation. The project is capable of powering more than 266,000 homes annually, meeting 7% of Los Angeles's electricity needs, while its hybrid design enables day-to-night renewable delivery and bolsters grid reliability.

In Missouri, Arevon commenced construction on its Kelso 1 & 2 Solar Project, a $500 million private investment that will boost the state's installed solar capacity by almost 50 percent when operational. This two-phase project marks Arevon's first utility-scale solar development in Missouri and features an innovative Environmental Attribute Purchase Agreement with Meta, ensuring traceable renewable energy attribution. Kelso not only adds substantial American-made energy to the region but also channels targeted local investments into schools, infrastructure, and community services.

Additionally, the company announced commercial operations at its $300 million Peregrine Energy Storage Project in San Diego, a 200 MW/400 MWh standalone battery system designed to strengthen California's grid resilience and facilitate greater integration of renewable generation. Peregrine represents Arevon's fifth completed utility-scale energy storage facility in California and bolsters the company's position as a leader in battery storage development and operations.

Arevon also continues to advance construction on its almost $400 million Ratts 1 & Heirloom Solar Projects in Indiana, a combined 265 MW of capacity which are expected to be operational this year, and anticipates starting construction on its 124 MW Big Muddy Solar Project in Illinois before year-end. The company also partnered with local utilities to develop and build an additional 480 megawatts of solar energy in Indiana with the Gibson Solar and Posey Solar projects, ensuring each project was successfully integrated into their communities.

Arevon's $600 million Nighthawk Energy Storage Project, a 300 MW/1,200 MWh facility in Poway, California, is also under construction, and when operational, will be able to power up to 385,000 homes during the peak electricity demand periods for four hours each day. The project will feature modern lithium iron phosphate batteries which are the safest technology on the market today. Arevon's number one priority is the safety of those who live and work in its project areas, and the company is proud to have safely operated its energy storage facilities in U.S. communities since 2021.

Together, these projects illustrate Arevon's ability to execute at scale and deliver tangible results that propel the advancement of affordable and reliable energy in America.

Arevon Drives Growth Through Innovative Financing

Since mid-September 2024, Arevon has secured more than $1.6 billion in financing for flagship solar and energy storage projects, which contributes to the company's industry leading $4.5 billion in total project financings secured over the last two years. Within the last 12 months, Arevon's notable executed transactions include $509 million for its Kelso Solar Project, $351 million for the Gibson Solar Project, $258 million for its Peregrine Energy Storage Project, and $98 million for its Ratts 1 & Heirloom Solar Projects. These investments are bringing more than a thousand megawatts of new renewable energy capacity to the grid, supporting local economies through job creation, tax revenue, and infrastructure improvements.

Moreover, Arevon also secured a $600 million credit facility, with the option to increase up to $850 million, that will enable the company to further expand its development portfolio of solar and energy storage assets and enhance the performance of its high-yielding operational assets.

The scope and diversity of these deals reflect Arevon's ability to structure innovative financing that strengthens project economics and enables additional development. Backed by strong relationships with capital partners, these financings are not only advancing the development, construction, and operations of Arevon's projects but also ensuring that host communities realize meaningful, long-term benefits derived from renewable energy generation.

Industry experts warn the models - including BMW’s “Neue Klasse” – may represent the carmakers’ last chance to turn the tide.
The carmakers face massive pressure to finally master the shift to electric mobility and related challenges such as digitalisation, said Fabian Brandt, head of Oliver Wyman in Germany.
The number of industry job openings with a focus on electric mobility has declined sharply over the past two years, according to an analysis by the Ifo economic institute.
Greenwashing accusations Environmental groups accused the carmakers of deceiving the public with their presentations at the global car show.","Against the backdrop of falling profits and shrinking global market share, German carmakers VW, BMW, and Mercedes unveiled a new generation of electric vehicles at this year’s IAA mobility show in Munich.

After disappointing sales of earlier models and investments worth billions of euros, the new vehicles promise longer ranges and faster charging times, alongside other innovations. Industry experts warn the models - including BMW’s “Neue Klasse” – may represent the carmakers’ last chance to turn the tide.

The combined market share of the three groups in the most important markets - Europe, the US and China - has fallen below 20 percent for the first time in decades, according to calculations by business daily Handelsblatt.

Of the approximately 1.2 million jobs in Germany's leading industry, 150,000 to 220,000 are at risk by 2030 due to tariffs, spiralling costs, and geopolitical tensions, consultancy Oliver Wyman warns in a report seen by the paper.

McKinsey gave a similarly bleak outlook. “The transition to electric mobility and software-based vehicles, unfavourable location conditions, new competitors and trade conditions could put up to a third of the industry's value added – 440 billion euros – at risk by 2035,” the consultancy wrote in a recent report quoted by Handelsblatt.

Last-ditch attempt?

The carmakers face massive pressure to finally master the shift to electric mobility and related challenges such as digitalisation, said Fabian Brandt, head of Oliver Wyman in Germany. “German carmakers must act now, while their coffers are still full. Otherwise, they risk ending up like many suppliers, who lack the capital to transform,” Brandt warned.

But contrary to the carmakers’ enthusiastic presentations at the IAA, they might have shifted down a gear when it comes to switching to electric drives. The number of industry job openings with a focus on electric mobility has declined sharply over the past two years, according to an analysis by the Ifo economic institute. “The development of labour demand in green jobs indicates that structural change is slowing down significantly,” said the institute’s Oliver Falck.

A report by green mobility NGO Transport & Environment (T&E) also found that European carmakers had “taken their foot off the gas” in the transition. “Europe now faces a decisive choice: to either lead the global BEV [battery electric vehicle] race and confidently enter the electric age or risk falling behind in the fossil fuel era,” T&E said, while stressing the shift remained on track thanks to cheaper batteries and better charging coverage, “despite carmakers’ attempt to slow down the EV market”.

Greenwashing accusations

Environmental groups accused the carmakers of deceiving the public with their presentations at the global car show. “German car manufacturers want to use the IAA Mobility as a fig leaf to conceal their fossil fuel-based business model,” said Jürgen Resch, head of NGO Environmental Action Germany (DUH). “Despite grandiose announcements about more e-mobility, the IAA remains primarily a greenwashing spectacle.”

Resch added that the automotive industry was lobbying aggressively against existing climate protection rules at the EU level, such as minimum CO2 standards for combustion engine cars.

Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND) took a similar stance. “While car companies present themselves as innovative and modern at the IAA, the same companies and their lobby organisations in Brussels are working to turn back the clock.”

BUND called for a joint effort between the government and the carmakers to finally provide small and affordable electric cars rather than luxury models.

Car summit in the chancellery

The car show also added fuel to Germany’s political debate about how to deal with the industry crisis. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said he plans a “car summit” to discuss the steps that are necessary to halt the relative decline.

Bavaria’s premier Markus Söder, a member of the CSU, sister party to Merz’s CDU, renewed his call to reverse the EU’s 2035 ban on the sale of new combustion engines.

“The combustion engine has a future with synthetic fuels and new technologies. The EU 2035 combustion engine ban puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk,” Söder told the newspaper “Bild am Sonntag”, adding that the car industry formed the “heart of our economy – without cars, there is a risk of collapse.”

There is broad consensus that synthetic fuels, also known as e-fuels, will not play a significant role in road transport because it would be far too expensive.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-09-08 09:01:27.134621

Her success proves that even in capital-intensive industries, like renewable energy storage, strategic vision and values-driven leadership can triumph over traditional funding constraints.","While Trump’s policies are putting the squeeze on renewable energy—cutting tax breaks and blocking solar projects—one woman-owned renewable energy storage company is proving it can weather the storm. On just $7 million in equity funding, Joley Michaelson has grown The Sun Company from a single venture into a sprawling network of energy businesses, each targeting a different piece of the industry's broken puzzle—a striking achievement in an industry where only 2.1% of venture capital flowed to female-only founder teams in 2024. Customers include Albertson and Safeway.

Founded in 2017 after Michaelson left her executive role at Tesla/SolarCity, the company has evolved from a single solar installer—handling the entire solar panel installation process— into an integrated renewable energy ecosystem developing proprietary zinc-iodide flow battery technology. Despite headwinds, the stationary energy storage market is projected to jump from $66.47 billion in 2025 to $293.59 billion by 2032.

Energy Transition Drives Growth Despite Political Headwinds

The renewable energy industry is facing mixed signals right now. On one hand, the Trump administration has rolled back climate policies and signed executive orders aimed at eliminating subsidies for wind and solar projects.

On the other hand, momentum tells a different story. Despite the policy headwinds, demand for clean power is accelerating. Solar and battery plants will account for 61% of power generation additions in 2025, marking a record year, according to the Energy Information Administration projections. With their ability to quickly bridge supply-demand gaps, solar and storage remain the fastest-growing solution to America’s energy needs.

""Major investors like Brookfield Asset Management and CDPQ are 'hoovering up renewable assets' at attractive valuations,"" notes one industry analysis, suggesting long-term investors view current conditions as buying opportunities. Falling prices, breakthrough technologies, and skyrocketing demand for clean power are driving the renewable energy boom, according to industry analysts who see Trump's return to the White House as little more than a temporary obstacle.

From Tesla Executive To Solar Energy Solutions Entrepreneur

Michaelson's journey into renewable energy began with frustration. After leaving her Tesla/SolarCity executive role in 2017, she identified three critical market gaps that convinced her to strike out on her own.

Firstly, ""I didn't believe the business models in the renewable space were accelerating the mass adoption of renewable energy, therefore not solving the big energy problems that we really had,"" Michaelson explains. ""It was an opportunist industry that was really focused around moving early adopters, which it did a great job at, but that was not going to be the long-term solution for the masses.""

The second gap involved technology. ""I didn't believe lithium ion was the future of stationary energy storage,"" Michaelson says, referring to fixed-location energy storage systems for homes, businesses, and industrial facilities—distinct from mobile applications like electric vehicles.

The third gap went deeper than business fundamentals. Michaelson envisioned what she calls ""capitalism 2.0""—reengineering capitalism around stakeholder alignment to eliminate value extraction and zero-sum dynamics. ""Really, at the heart of that is solving for relationship, because that underpinning is a very important part of our social structure,"" she notes.

This philosophy isn't just rhetoric. The Sun Company operates as a Delaware public benefit corporation, a designation allowing fiduciary decisions beyond shareholder returns. ""Most people don't even know that designation exists,"" Michaelson observes.

How An Energy Storage Startup Managed On Minimal Capital

Building an empire on $7 million investment requires extraordinary resourcefulness. Michaelson spent 2017 in research and development, reviewing hundreds of patents for long-duration energy storage technology before incorporating in 2018 with three divisions: renewable energy assets, battery technology development, and behind-the-meter renewable power plants.

The funding challenge proved formidable. ""Two percent of capital goes to women [solely founded companies] already puts me at a significant disadvantage,"" Michaelson explains. Female founders tend to be in the consumer space. ""Then put yourself into a high-tech kind of boys' World of Energy. And I'm a needle in a haystack.""

Her unconventional approach to capitalism compounded the challenge. ""I’ve had private equity and venture cap come to me and say, ‘we’ll give you exactly what you need, but we're going to take 98% of your company, and you can earn it back over time, '"" she recalls. ""Thank you, but no, thank you.""

The solution required sacrifice from her entire team. ""My early staff deferred their compensation for years,"" Michaelson reveals—a testament to their belief in her vision. She deliberately recruited from adjacent industries rather than from within the renewable energy sector (which is focused on lithium-ion solutions), bringing in talent from technology, utilities, healthcare, optics, and semiconductors.

Her selective approach to investors paid off when she connected with Alternative Wealth Partners' Kelly Ann Winget. ""We were looking for an opportunity to expand our portfolio into alternative energy, but not a copy-paste solar deal or a trendy renewable project that would be irrelevant in three years,"" Winget explains. ""The Sun Company checked a lot of those boxes for us, innovating in a way that allowed the partnership between AWP and TSC to creatively build the future of energy together.""

Full-Service Renewable Energy Model Emerges

The Sun Company has since evolved into a family of companies: The Sun Company Americas (developer/owner/operator of energy assets), The BESSt Company (battery technology), Sun Company Construction (installation), with other companies to follow.

The company's zinc-iodide flow battery technology addresses what Michaelson sees as lithium-ion's limitations for stationary storage. For her, energy accessibility, affordability, reliability, and security drive the innovation strategy.

Kim Eaves, president of Affiliate Energy Group, invested specifically for the technology's practical benefits: ""I chose to invest in The Sun Company and The BESSt Company because their technology directly tackles the demand charges and peak power costs that have long burdened my customers. Equally important, their solutions enable local sourcing and manufacturing—an essential priority for my client base.""

Stationary Energy Storage Investment Climate Remains Strong

As Michaelson prepares for a fall fundraising round through investment banking, her bootstrap approach offers lessons for other entrepreneurs facing capital constraints. ""You can bootstrap. It's hard, but you can do it. You can scrape by. It's all about your holding power,"" she notes.

The stationary energy-storage market's projected growth to $293.59 billion by 2032 suggests plenty of runway ahead. Political turbulence may cloud the immediate outlook, but companies like The Sun Company are proving that innovative business strategies can still generate serious returns when the going gets tough. The key lies in innovation—developing new approaches to old problems, nurturing solid partnerships with customers and investors, and staying ahead of the technology curve.

For female entrepreneurs in particular, Michaelson's story provides both inspiration and a roadmap—showing that principled leadership and patient capital can overcome systemic disadvantages to create lasting impact. Her success proves that even in capital-intensive industries, like renewable energy storage, strategic vision and values-driven leadership can triumph over traditional funding constraints.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68bd6d064278e708536b8060/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-08 09:01:30.712837

“The costs of the climate crisis have fallen most heavily on Africa.
Muyungi insisted they must be allowed to exploit those resources, despite the impact on the climate crisis.
For rich countries to tackle the climate crisis, Africa’s assistance will be essential.
Abay Yimere, a scholar at the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University in the US, said: “If the climate crisis is not tackled in Africa, that will be a problem for migration.","The first signs of a takeoff of Africa’s green economy are raising hopes that a transformation of the continent’s fortunes may be under way, driven by solar power and an increase in low-carbon investment.

African leaders are meeting this week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the Africa Climate Summit, a precursor to the global UN Cop30 in November. They will call for an increase in support from rich countries for Africa’s green resurgence, without which they will warn it could be fragile and spread unevenly.

Richard Muyungi, the climate envoy and adviser to the president of Tanzania, said: “Africa is ready to be part of [the global fight to stave off climate breakdown] provided we are supported with finance, technology and capacity-building.

“There has been an increase of investments in some areas but Africa still needs a lot of financing to be able to be part of the global solution, and to address the challenges we are facing.”

Green energy is booming in Africa, with 20 countries breaking records for imports of solar panels in the 12 months to June. According to the thinktank Ember, imports of photovoltaic equipment from China rose by 60% over the past year, from 9MW in 2024 to 15MW of capacity, with a tripling of imports to countries outside South Africa.

Though the increase is impressive, it is from a low base. Africa, which boasts the greatest potential for solar power, has lagged far behind other countries in installations. Only 4% of global solar generation last year was in Africa, and in 2023, the International Energy Agency reported that Belgium had as many solar panels as the entire continent.

“There is a glimmer of light [in the increased investment] but this is still quite meagre compared to other continents in the global south,” Muyungi said.

Last year’s imported panels would add about 5% to current electricity generation capacity in 16 countries, according to Ember, but the need remains vast. About 600 million people in Africa lack access to electricity, and about a billion have only firewood or dirty fuels for cooking. Women and girls are worst affected.

Melaku Yirga, the regional director for Africa at Mercy Corps, a humanitarian organisation, said: “Renewable energy is not only Africa’s greatest opportunity, it is also an urgent necessity. Renewable power enables everything from irrigation and food storage to early-warning systems, healthcare and livelihoods.”

While recent increases in renewable energy investment were welcome, Yirga said the public sector and overseas aid were still vital.

“Africa has no shortage of ambition in renewable energy, but without stronger international finance and the right incentives, the private sector will remain on the sidelines and adaptation goals will go unmet,” he said.

“Private sector financing must be met with public commitments, and funding must also be long-term and reliable – short grants rarely achieve full impact, as meaningful engagement with governments and communities takes time and requires significant upfront investment.”

Reductions in overseas aid from rich countries are causing consternation among African governments, many of which are blighted by record debt burdens, exacerbated by the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and recent interest rate rises.

Macky Sall, the former president of Senegal, said: “The drop in official development assistance fundamentally changes the climate calculus. Where does that leave Africa, if we can no longer count on our partners’ promises?

“The costs of the climate crisis have fallen most heavily on Africa. We are not the cause. We are not only footing the largest bill – we are also seeing the cheques to stem the damage cancelled.”

Private sector companies will put cash into renewable energy, but few will help Africa adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis, which are already being felt in the form of droughts, floods and crop failures. Investment to build resilience – such as water storage systems, better infrastructure and new farming techniques – is lacking.

A report published at the summit on Monday showed that while Africa needed at least $70bn a year to adapt to the effects of the climate crisis, and possibly much more, only $15bn was provided in adaptation finance to the continent in 2023.

Without urgent action to address that vast financing gap, Africa’s future costs from climate impacts will balloon, wiping out a fifth of GDP by 2050.

Patrick Verkooijen, the chief executive of the Global Center on Adaptation thinktank, says rich countries must increase their finance for adaptation in Africa, which is responsible for only 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions while bearing the brunt of climate breakdown.

“Europe [and other countries] will shoot themselves in the foot if they defund ODA [official development assistance],” he said. “African leaders will see it as a stab in the back.”

While Africa is behind in climate adaptation, its riches are increasingly sought after by China and the rest of the rich world.

Africa has some of the biggest deposits of “critical minerals” – elements vital to building renewable energy components. Cobalt, lithium, copper, nickel, rare earths and other minerals are abundant in parts of Africa, which has spurred a global scramble for the resources.

Human rights abuses have soared in some mining areas, with child labour and the exploitation of adult workers, particularly women, in places such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Africa’s under-resourced public sector is struggling to contain the damage and ensure resource extraction is done responsibly, without causing environmental devastation and in a way that benefits local people.

Africa also abounds in gas, with reserves of the fossil fuel that have scarcely been tapped in some countries. Muyungi insisted they must be allowed to exploit those resources, despite the impact on the climate crisis. “We do not envisage anything to stop us using gas – we need it for our development,” he said.

For rich countries to tackle the climate crisis, Africa’s assistance will be essential. If global north governments fail to address the continent’s needs, they will feel the impact. Roughly 60% of Africa’s population is under 25, a “youthquake” that could spur development or, if poorly handled, will be felt around the world.

Abay Yimere, a scholar at the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University in the US, said: “If the climate crisis is not tackled in Africa, that will be a problem for migration. If we do not provide them with jobs, and adapt to climate change, the impact will be huge and not controllable. The global north should look at this from their own national perspectives and see where their interest lies.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba407c567828cd71169084e4965e4316b837874a/285_0_3750_3001/master/3750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dc9f6b413184073be8b1aa368731e64d",N,,2025-09-08 09:01:35.547899

Its impact now widely publicized. Much of this synthetic material is now produced overseas in countries with lower safety standards, but the environmental impact is felt globally.

“We don't want to just say, you pollute, you’re bad,” Ford said. “Let's reinvent and innovate the way that we are manufacturing these fibers, and that's a lot of what I'm doing.”

Ford’s acrylics are made with less waste, using every input component for the output.

“We have to think, how can we manufacture these materials in a more responsible way while still being able to benefit fibers that go into our furniture, go into our clothes,” Ford said.

She spins her fabrics in the university’s vast laboratories.

“It looks like a manufacturing facility downstairs,” she said.

Ford’s modacrylics are made with these machines.

Developing any fabric begins with raw material. It’s first fed through a card, which combs out any imperfections and dirt.

Then it’s condensed into a thinner line called a sliver and put into a coil.

The sliver heads into a separate machine to be stretched out in a process called drawing.

Eventually it’s loaded into a machine to be spun into yarn.

Ford’s fiber can run at 1,000 meters per minute.

Across the hall, advanced industrial sewing machines turn that yarn into fabrics.

While Ford’s acrylics may not be used to outfit you from head to toe, the fiber has applications for flame-retardant protective clothing and furniture, all while reducing emissions.

“We believe definitely that we can reduce the CO2 footprint of this process by like two-thirds,” Ford said.

Ford is now using NCInnovation funding from the state to increase production.

NCInnovation approved more than $13 million in funding for research and development at colleges across the state this year.

“We'll be able to scale up, moving from a few pounds to 100 to 200 pounds of fiber,” Ford said.

She hopes to prove her technology is compatible with the equipment and processes used in the United States, encouraging more production that results in superior performance.

“As researchers, we always want to push the envelope and make sure that our workers are a little safer, making sure that the consumers that buy those fibers, that they will also be safe as well,” Ford said.

Ford said two companies have agreed to use fabric prototypes in their commercial processes.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/IMG_1420-2,N,,2025-09-08 12:24:14.591336

In 2025, DOE finalized commercial water heater rules, rolled back some residential boiler standards, and delayed other mandates. For wholesalers, the uncertainty is as impactful as the rules themselves.

Understanding these standards is critical to managing inventory into 2026, preparing for price volatility, and educating customers; contractors will rely on wholesale partners for guidance.

According to the DOE Fact Sheet from January 2025, the DOE’s Appliance and Equipment Standards Program has long aimed to reduce energy costs and emissions while driving innovation. This year, three developments stand out for the PHCP supply chain:

Commercial water heaters: Condensing models required; 95–96% TE/UEF compliance by October 2026

Residential boilers: DOE withdrew the proposed 95% AFUE rule, preserving non-condensing options

Appliance/water efficiency mandates: Several have been delayed under political pressure

Voices from the supply chain

Stocking strategies must balance immediate contractor needs with long-term compliance timelines. A unit that’s legal today may be unsellable in 18 months. Pricing also remains volatile, as demand for condensing vs. non-condensing units ebbs and flows with the regulations.

“We can’t afford to stock products that might be obsolete in 18 months, but our contractors expect us to have the right mix on the shelf today,” says a regional VP at a national PHCP wholesaler. “Every rule change feels like a moving target.”

For contractors, this translates to confusion on the jobsite. They look to distributors for guidance. “Our members need predictable rules and realistic timelines. Every time standards change or get delayed, it adds confusion for contractors and their customers,” says Mark Valentini Vice President of Legislative Affairs at PHCC.

Manufacturers face their own pressures. Designing compliant equipment often requires retooling entire product lines. One water heater OEM points out that “Every new efficiency mandate means redesigning models from the ground up. Wholesalers are on the front line of explaining those changes to contractors.”

Meanwhile, DOE officials argue that the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term pain. U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright stated in a February 2025 announcement delaying several standards that: “Our goal is to balance innovation with affordability, ensuring that efficiency standards benefit both contractors and consumers over time.”

While regulatory uncertainty can’t be eliminated, wholesalers can take proactive steps to minimize disruption:

Stay informed: Track DOE notices, PHCC updates, and manufacturer guidance to anticipate changes early.

Educate customers: Host training sessions or provide sales sheets explaining condensing vs. non-condensing equipment and compliance deadlines.

Plan inventory strategically: Use data to balance high-demand non-condensing units in the short term with condensing stock for 2026.

Leverage manufacturer partnerships: Collaborate on product rollout strategies and co-branded contractor education.

Rebates and incentives

Tax credits, rebates and utility programs all offer financial incentives that can often reduce upfront costs for electrification and energy-efficient upgrades. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Department of Energy (DOE) funding are key to this opportunity, offering layered savings that can transform project feasibility. The key is stacking incentives wisely by combining federal tax credits with DOE rebates, state- and utility-level programs.

How are the Inflation Reduction Act and DOE funding offsetting upfront costs? For IRA tax credits, there are two major players: the Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D) and the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (Section 25C).

The former covers 30% of the cost of clean energy systems such as solar panels, geothermal heat pumps or battery storage from 2022 through 2032, and usage tapers to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. It offers a 30% deduction for upgrades like heat pumps, insulation, windows and electrical panels: available from 2023 to 2032, and capped at $1,200/year for renovations and up to $2,000 for appliances like heat pumps.

The IRA also directs significant funding to the DOE for immediate rebates:

High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program (HEEHRP): Allocates $4.5 billion over 10 years to help low- and moderate-income households pivot toward electrified systems. Rebates reach up to $14,000 per home (e.g., $8,000 for heat pumps, $1,750 for heat pump water heaters, $4,000 for panel upgrades, $2,500 for wiring, $1,600 for insulation, and others)

DOE HOMES & HEAR Rebate Programs: These can be combined with 25C tax credits on overlapping retrofit work.

Regulation is never static

The DOE continues to solicit input on future rulemakings, such as energy standards for manufactured housing. That means wholesalers should expect more changes in the years to come.

For the PHCP distribution channel, one fact is clear: success won’t come from waiting for certainty. It will come from agility, transparency, and strong customer education.

The 2025 standards are a reminder that regulation is never static. But wholesalers who position themselves as both compliance experts and trusted advisors can turn these challenges into an opportunity to strengthen contractor relationships—and protect their margins in the process.",https://www.supplyht.com/ext/resources/2025/09/Pipes-stock.jpg?height=635&t=1757329230&width=1200,N,,2025-09-08 09:02:03.115509

The Advanced Energy Solutions community The World Economic Forum supports an integrated approach to energy solutions, including energy storage, advanced nuclear, clean fuels, hydrogen and carbon removal.","There are several key energy technology trends dominating 2025.

Security, costs and jobs; decarbonization; China; India; and AI all need to be carefully monitored.

The World Economic Forum’s Advanced Energy Solutions community helps the energy technology community cooperate and accelerate the deployment of new energy technologies.

Geopolitical tensions, shifting policies and economic uncertainty are reshaping the landscape of energy investment. The recently dismantled US Inflation Reduction Act is one example of how rapidly things can change at a country level, abolishing incentives and policy environments for entire technologies.

Despite US policy pivots, globally things are moving fast and there is a race between countries to establish a technology and manufacturing edge. Global energy investment in renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency and electrification is set to increase in 2025 to $2.2 trillion according to World Energy Investment 2025.

Here are the key trends shaping energy technology investment in 2025:

1. Security, cost and jobs

Energy security, affordability and industrial policy drive various energy technology choices and investments, particularly among energy-importing countries. Led by these factors, and despite a lower priority placed on decarbonization, clean energy investments continue to grow rapidly globally.

China's investments in renewables, energy storage and batteries, electric vehicles and nuclear, for example, aim to primarily reduce its reliance on oil and gas imports and to exert leadership in new technologies. Europe, meanwhile, made great efforts to decrease its dependence on oil and gas from Russia by investing in renewables and efficiency. Similarly, in the US, new policies are being introduced to reshore supply chains to the country.

2. Decarbonization

The importance of energy security, cost and broader industrial policies increased substantially; however, at the same time, decarbonization and emissions reductions remain top priorities for policymakers and companies.

Business plans and goals are often more practical now and timelines are sometimes extended, but a high level of commitment to decarbonization remains, including among the incumbent energy industry.

Attention is also now laser-focused on how local pollution from energy production and use can be minimized through technology to secure a social licence to operate. It is about here and now, rather than 2050.

3. China's domination

China is the dominant force in next-generation energy technologies. It is by far the largest energy investor globally, spending almost as much as the EU and US combined, pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into the manufacturing and deployment of renewables, energy storage, nuclear power and more.

China's industrial and energy policies are often considered to be very effective in driving domestic demand and building manufacturing and supply chains. The country dominates clean energy technology supply chains, from wind turbines and solar panels to batteries and electrolysers. This investment has been transformational for the country’s economy and has contributed to establishing China as a major player in global politics.

4. India ascends

India has set bold ambitions and demonstrated remarkable progress on its energy transition investment. It surpassed its 2030 goal of achieving 40% of installed capacity from renewable energy sources nine years ahead of time.

To replicate this success and complement it with 'made in India' goals, the central and state governments have implemented numerous tools, including incentives for domestic manufacturing and mandates for clean energy deployment. These are helping the country to emerge as a major player on the global stage when it comes to energy storage, clean hydrogen and solar panels.

Indian business champions pursue these ambitions at speed and scale. The Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex, for example, scheduled to start up in 2026, will house a gigawatt-scale manufacturing ecosystem of solar panels (10GW), battery storage (100 GWh) and electrolyzers for hydrogen (3 GW). It will be the world's largest such complex, with a built-up area equivalent to four times the size of the Tesla Gigafactory.

5. AI hunger

Data centre electricity consumption is set to more than double to around 945 TWh by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency, slightly exceeding Japan’s total electricity consumption today. AI is the most important driver of this growth.

However, grid connection queues are long and complex as building new transmission lines can take four to eight years. Generation equipment is also in tight supply, with turbine deliveries for new gas-fired power plants facing lead times of several years, often with deliveries scheduled in the next decade. As electricity grids are already under strain in many places, 20% of planned data centre projects could be at risk of delays.

In fact, power availability has decisively emerged as the leading factor for data centre site selection according to the 2025 Data Center Power Report by Bloom Energy, even ahead of things like proximity to fibre optic networks. In effect, almost a third of data centres are expected to run entirely on onsite power by 2030, bypassing the entire existing grid network. Interestingly, reducing carbon emissions is a lower, but lasting, priority: 95% of those surveyed for the report affirmed that sustainability and carbon reduction targets remain.

The Advanced Energy Solutions community

The World Economic Forum supports an integrated approach to energy solutions, including energy storage, advanced nuclear, clean fuels, hydrogen and carbon removal. No single technology will solve the energy transition alone; a mix of solutions will be needed.

Different regions, industries and companies will have their strategies, but they must work together.

Platforms, such as the Forum’s Advanced Energy Solutions community, can help speed up this cooperation and accelerate the deployment of new technologies, such as energy storage, clean fuels, hydrogen, advanced nuclear and carbon removal, from decades to years.

The community engages industry leaders who drive frontier segments of the energy system to shape the advanced energy solutions industry vision and narrative. It supports partnerships among innovators, large energy companies, energy users and investors and informs policy-making.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_x43ADzwjsYH4tYR3r5qzSOXb61GN8FyENQiHv-oBea4.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 09:01:39.949747

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is due to hold talks with automotive industry leaders on Friday.

In a letter sent to Brussels on Monday, 150 EV executives, including bosses from Volvo Cars and Polestar, warned that any delay to the 2035 target would hand a competitive advantage to global rivals – particularly Chinese manufacturers – and undermine investor confidence in Europe's green transition.

""Weakening targets now would send a signal that Europe can be talked out of its own commitments,"" said Michael Lohscheller, Polestar's chief executive, in a statement. ""That would not only harm the climate. It would harm Europe's ability to compete.""

As part of its fight against climate change, the EU requires carmakers to progressively cut carbon emissions produced by new vehicles sold in the bloc, or face steep fines.

In March, the European Commission yielded to pressure from European automakers to give them three years, rather than one, to meet the carbon emission targets.

Two weeks ago, the heads of the European automobile manufacturers' and automotive suppliers' associations sent a letter to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stressing that a 100 percent reduction in emissions for cars by 2035 was ""no longer feasible"".

That letter was signed by Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kaellenius – a significant endorsement from one of Europe's automotive giants.

State of play: The GOP-controlled House passed a $79 billion spending plan Aug. 26 that slashed spending for the Economic Development Leaders of Michigan's (EDLM) priority programs.

Negotiations are ongoing between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate, which passed a plan in May.

Lawmakers and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer may face a government shutdown if they miss the Oct. 1 budget deadline.

Zoom in: EDLM crafted a list of 10 priorities last month to set the table for funding negotiations.

The list includes $100 million for a business attraction program, $150 million for community development programs and doubling the state's R&D tax credit to $200 million.

Also: The coalition wants to expand the Transformational Brownfield Program, which provides incentives worth hundreds of millions toward Detroit's major developments.

Examples are incentives worth $425 million for local projects involving Dan Gilbert's Bedrock firm; $615 million toward the Ilitches' District Detroit; and $232 million for Henry Ford's hospital expansion in New Center, Crain's reported.

What they're saying: ""If you look at where we're at right now with the budget, they've all been zeroed out,"" Maureen Donohue Krauss, CEO of the Detroit Regional Partnership, tells Axios Detroit.

Context: The House budget is a starting point for negotiations, Krauss says.

The Detroit Regional Partnership and other EDLM member groups will meet with legislators to make their case.

The other side: Michigan doesn't need corporate handouts to attract and retain businesses, says state Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers), who chairs the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments.

A low-tax regulatory environment, quality infrastructure, and a reliable electrical grid can accomplish those goals, he tells Axios.

Elliott, www.nytimes.com, farah-stockman, rebecca-f-elliott",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/us/georgia-immigration-raid-ev-battery-plant-hyundai-lg.html,"The immigration raid last week on an electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia owned by two South Korean manufacturers was yet another setback for what had been a fast-growing industry in the United States.
The United States is relatively new to making these batteries.
Other critical sectors have used labor from abroad as they build in the United States.
Still, the sweeping nature of the raid could make skilled technicians more apprehensive about coming to the United States, even for short stints.
A contractor died this summer at a battery plant in Holland, Mich., after he got stuck in a machine.","The immigration raid last week on an electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia owned by two South Korean manufacturers was yet another setback for what had been a fast-growing industry in the United States.

The sector was already beleaguered by lower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles, tariffs on raw materials and the rapid phaseout of a federal tax credit for purchases of E.V.s, which have led companies to delay or scale back production.

But the raid at the plant under construction in Ellabell, Ga., which is owned by the carmaker Hyundai and battery supplier LG Energy Solution, raised more risks for foreign manufacturers in the United States. Immigration officials arrested 475 people. Of them, about 300 were South Korean citizens, according to the South Korean foreign minister’s office.

It is not yet clear how many of those detained by ICE last week were building the plant and how many were workers brought in to install and calibrate specialized equipment, or to train the local work force.

Some American workers in the area have complained that they have not been given a fair chance at employment at the $7.6 billion taxpayer-subsidized complex, which has been billed as the largest economic development project in Georgia’s history.

These labor tensions have been building as the federal government, seeking a stronger foothold in the battery business, has wooed foreign companies to expand manufacturing on U.S. soil.

The United States is relatively new to making these batteries. The leading manufacturers are headquartered in Asia, and they typically bring engineers and technicians from their home countries to set up new factories, where assembly lines of robots coat, slice and assemble the components that help power a car. Much of the battery cell technology is proprietary, and there is little margin for error.

“When you don’t have a whole cohort of people who know how to run cell-making factories, you rely heavily on the folks from the home factory,” said Celina Mikolajczak, who was been an executive at battery companies including Panasonic.

That practice has not gone over well with American labor unions that want those jobs, said Betony Jones, who was director of the office of energy jobs at the Department of Energy during the Biden administration.

“E.V. battery companies are very secretive about I.P., so they were bringing in their own workers when it came to installing their machines and maintaining their machines,” she said, referring to intellectual property. “But unions were really pushing for that work.”

.

Over the weekend, LG Energy Solution said it suspended all U.S. business trips except for customer meetings, conferences and exhibitions, and advised all traveling employees to “immediately return home or remain at their accommodations, considering their current work status.”

The company’s pullback comes as investment in U.S. battery manufacturing was beginning to slow. Tesla’s success in popularizing electric vehicles, paired with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act three years ago, brought a flood of money to the sector. Companies poured roughly $80 billion into U.S. battery manufacturing since the middle of 2022, up from around $10 billion in the three years earlier, according to Rhodium Group, a research firm that tracks investments with M.I.T.’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.

But the business outlook was darkening as E.V. sales fell behind many companies’ lofty expectations. The Trump administration’s efforts this year to raise trade barriers and remake federal energy policy to be more favorable toward fossil fuels introduced new uncertainty and financial challenges. Perhaps most notably, starting next month, electric vehicles will no longer be eligible for a $7,500 tax credit that had helped make the cars more affordable for many buyers.

Other critical sectors have used labor from abroad as they build in the United States. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, for example, relied heavily on labor from Taiwan at its plant on the outskirts of Phoenix.

The raid has also caused outrage in Seoul, where major media outlets ran articles highlighting the poor conditions in which Korean workers would be held, and included a photograph released by ICE of the workers being arrested. News outlets also focused on the difficulty South Korean companies experience in securing work visas for the technicians they need to complete plants in the United States.

South Koreans can enter the United States without a visa for 90 days under a visa-waiver program that allows them to participate in tourism or attend some business meetings, but not full-time work, according to Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research think tank. A temporary business visa, known as B-1, allows for short-term training and consulting, but not full-time construction work.

On Sunday, the two countries reached a deal to free those detainees and send them home to South Korea via a chartered plane, according to Kang Hoon-sik, the chief of staff for President Lee Jae Myung of South Korea.

Still, the sweeping nature of the raid could make skilled technicians more apprehensive about coming to the United States, even for short stints. That could increase the cost of establishing new U.S. factories and slow construction.

“The current situation is creating a dilemma,” said Andrew Yi, a Seoul-based partner for Roland Berger, a consulting firm. Strict enforcement of certain visa rules “would in the short term delay the completion of the factories that are going up.”

Barry Zeigler, business manager of Local 188, a union that represents plumbers, pipe-fitters, welders and HVAC service technicians for 15 counties in Georgia, said South Koreans were working as welders and pipe-fitters in the Georgia plant — jobs that he said should have been given to Americans. He said he had visited the plant in the past, adding that about 65 members of his union were hired by subcontractors to lay pipes there, but were let go a few months ago.

“People think the Koreans are here to do a special job; that’s B.S.,” he said, adding that politicians had turned a deaf ear to his complaints about the factory until the raid.

The plant has been dogged for months by investigative reports by the local TV station WTOC about poor safety conditions and widespread use of unauthorized laborers. At least three workers have died at the megasite, including a man identified as Sunbok You, who was run over by a forklift in March, according to local law enforcement. The police report obtained by the station identified the forklift driver as Sunhwam Bae, who spoke to officers through a translator.

LG Energy Solution has faced safety issues at other plants as well. A contractor died this summer at a battery plant in Holland, Mich., after he got stuck in a machine. And this past weekend, 15 people from the same facility were hospitalized after a chemical spill, according to local news reports.

Ms. Jones, the former Biden administration official, said American workers had a right to be angry if E.V. battery manufacturers were cutting corners with safety and declining to hire and train American workers.

“There are a lot of battery factories being built across the U.S. and their workers are not dying,” she said.

In a statement, LG Energy Solution said the company prioritizes “the safety and well-being of our team” and that its $25 billion investment in North American manufacturing would create about 14,000 jobs in the United States by 2027. Hyundai said the company was “committed to maintaining the highest safety standards.” It also said its employees “are required to comply fully with U.S. laws and regulations.”

The politics are awkward for Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican who embraced the Biden administration’s clean energy policies, showering the project with an estimated $2 billion in tax credits and incentives in a bid to make Georgia the “electric mobility capital of the country.” President Trump has relentlessly attacked both electric vehicles and Mr. Kemp, who resisted Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn 2020 election results in Georgia.

Marie Hodge Gordon, director of communications at the Georgia Department of Economic Development, released a statement that emphasized the fact that electric cars — the Hyundai IONIQ 5 — have already begun rolling off the assembly line at the auto plant on the site. It stressed that the incentives for the project “are based on new, long-term Georgia jobs, not the roles under investigation by law enforcement.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/07/multimedia/00biz-foreign-factory-workers-lcfb/00biz-foreign-factory-workers-lcfb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 07:00:29.739313

However, state energy officials have pushed back against those findings.
Despite some data discrepancies, energy prices have been higher in recent years than they were 10 years ago.
A new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational.
Distribution costs are regulated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and increases can reflect system upgrades like new poles or substations.","Concerns about the high cost of energy were frequently heard in legislative hearings, debates, and throughout the halls of the State House this past session. It’s front of mind for many Mainers as prices have noticeably increased in recent years.

Calls for lawmakers to do more were heard during multiple public hearings before the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee where people lined up to speak for hours, including businesses who feared their livelihood could be in jeopardy over high electricity bills.

It is an issue that Republicans in particular have raised, arguing that state policies that encourage sustainable energy use are to blame.

“The reason Maine ranks so high in electricity rates is because of bad policies passed in our state,” said House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor.

How concerns about energy costs paved way for a prohibition on towns banning heating fuel sources

However, the actual dollar amount ratepayers end up shelling out each month is influenced by a multitude of factors — some of which lawmakers have more control over than others. While the global markets that dictate prices of natural gas and other energy sources are beyond the reach of state senators and representatives, there are some ways that energy costs can be addressed from Augusta.

Misleading data

In early August, new data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration garnered a lot of attention by seeming to indicate that Maine had the biggest increase in the country for residential electricity rates between May 2024 and 2025.

Republican lawmakers latched onto that stat as evidence that the policies coming out of Augusta are driving up costs for ratepayers in Maine.

“Unlike other states, Maine’s leaders have pursued an agenda that prioritizes green mandates and out-of-state profits over affordability for ratepayers,” said Peter Wood (R-Norway) in the Maine House Republican August 22 radio address highlighting that statistics.

However, state energy officials have pushed back against those findings.

Phil Bartlett, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission, said it is hard to understand what methodology was used for that research because that data isn’t consistent with what the state is seeing for customers of the two privately owned utility companies, Central Maine Power and Versant.

“There have been increases over the last several years, but this year it’s actually a little bit less than it was two years ago,” Bartlett said. “It’s been a bit of seesaw in the last few years, but we’ve seen increases in various components of the bills, but it’s more like 10%, not 36%.”

Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said she couldn’t recreate the federal data that showed a 36% increase in average residential rates. She said that her office’s data shows that from June 2024 to June 2025, there was a year-over-year bill increase for residential customers of: 20.7% in CMP territory, 11.9% in Versant Bangor Hydro territory and 15% in Versant Maine Public District.

Sanborn added that smaller, consumer-owned utilities aren’t tracked in the same way, but they also account for less customers, so they wouldn’t skew the data enough to bring it up to 36%.

That data point also doesn’t seem to account for states procuring their energy rates on different schedules. Maine uses a 12-month cycle, but other states could be updating their rates more frequently.

Despite some data discrepancies, energy prices have been higher in recent years than they were 10 years ago. Though, they have been falling since a peak in 2023. And people are calling on lawmakers to do more to stem the cost of electricity at a time when it feels like everyday essentials just keep getting more expensive.

So what can lawmakers do?

Electricity bills can be broken down into a few main cost components. While there is opportunity for the Legislature to address prices in each of these areas, some of that work is already underway but may take time for its impacts to be felt.

Much attention has been given to stranded costs, which is the smallest slice of the price breakdown. Also called public policy costs, stranded costs is a catch-all category that can include the cost of storm recovery, solar incentives and a low-income assistance program.

“If Republicans were in charge, we would start by ending the solar tax known as net energy billing that subsidizes solar panels for the wealthy on the backs of Maine ratepayers,” Faulkingham said.

During the last legislative session, there was a push to reform or even repeal the state’s solar incentive program, called net energy billing, which critics like Faulkingham said would reduce electricity bills for ratepayers. While there was broad consensus the program needed to be adjusted, some didn’t agree with making it a scapegoat for the cost hike people experienced.

The average customer was paying about one cent per kilowatt-hour for policy costs over the past couple years, Bartlett said, with the typical Maine residence using about 550 kilowatt-hours each month. That jumped to 1.7 cents in 2025, which is a real increase, but not what’s driving the total people see on their bills, he added.

“The suggestion that we’re seeing these wild increases because of those policy costs… just the math doesn’t work,” Bartlett said.

In June, Gov. Janet Mills signed legislation into law to reform net energy billing and rein in future costs it could impose on ratepayers. While the cost of the program is expected to exceed $234 million this year alone, the new law is projected to save Maine electricity customers more than $1.2 billion over the next 16 years, according to a news release from the Maine Public Advocate’s Office after its passage.

Much more significant to one’s energy bill than those stranded costs is the supply rate, which reflects the cost of what actually generates the power.

“New England has historically had higher electricity prices than the U.S. average, driven by the region’s heavy reliance on natural gas to produce electricity,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office.

Especially in recent years, this has driven up costs for consumers because the cost of natural gas itself is subject to national and global events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

While Maine lawmakers can’t control those global market fluctuations, some believe that pursuing more sources of in-state and in-region renewable energy could offer more stable prices.

Earlier this year, the governor signed legislation that will transition the current Governor’s Energy Office into the Department of Energy Resources. That new cabinet-level entity will have the authority to do clean energy procurements, which could help transition the state away from volatile natural gas and fossil fuel prices.

A new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational. That would have translated to about $400 million in savings for ratepayers throughout New England, the study found. However, the Trump administration took action early on to pause the development of offshore wind projects, leaving plans to put turbines in the Gulf of Maine on pause.

The remainder of an electric bill is the cost to deliver the electricity to the end user.

That can be broken down into transmission costs, which are regulated federally, and distribution costs, which is the price of taking energy from the bulk transmission system to the poles and wires that reach people’s homes.

Transmission prices have increased over the past decade to cover the cost of system upgrades that are passed onto ratepayers. Because New England states share a regional grid called ISO-New England, those jumps have been seen across the region.

Distribution costs are regulated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and increases can reflect system upgrades like new poles or substations.

Because of a law passed in 2022, utility companies are required to file a 10-year plan to determine what upgrades will be needed to improve grid reliability and resilience. The plans should also account for the state’s climate policy goals and cost-effectiveness for ratepayers.

Greater attention has been paid to grid resilience after the state faced unprecedented winter storms in 2023 and 2024 that incurred significant costs to ratepayers. In the storms’ wake, Mills established the Infrastructure Rebuilding and Resilience Commission to find ways to shore up the state’s energy systems against future severe storms. The commission’s final report came out in May 2025, highlighting the need to improve the grid, especially as the state moves toward greater electrification of transportation and home heating and cooling systems.

“With more low-cost, local clean energy projects, nation-leading energy efficiency programs, and efforts to strengthen our electric grid against extreme storms, Maine continues to work to protect ratepayers and build a more affordable, resilient energy future,” Burgess said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CMPbill-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 07:00:11.571889

NJ moves forward with $500M Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program

NJEDA drafting rules and seeking public input for implementation

$100M in credits reserved for clean energy product manufacturers

Incentives aim to fuel local investment, job creation and innovation

At a time of growing political divides, bipartisanship was on full display last month in Kearny – as Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill aimed at incentivizing manufacturing in the Garden State. Assembly Bill 5687/Senate Bill 4407, passed alongside the Fiscal Year 2026 budget earlier this summer, established the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program — a $500 million tax credit program.

“This legislation marks the single largest investment in manufacturing in New Jersey’s history – $500 million in tax credits to fuel local investment and long-term job creation,” Murphy said at the Aug. 13 signing ceremony. The event took place at MAC Products Inc. in Kearny, a third-generation, family-owned business that designs and manufactures products for electrical infrastructure throughout North America.

“And I want to repeat that this has, from moment one, been a bipartisan, all-in effort,” Murphy said. “With these new businesses and jobs, we will supercharge our state’s leadership in advanced manufacturing – at the same time, we will rebuild a stable path to the middle class.”

The New Jersey Economic Development Authority will administer the program. Eligible businesses in manufacturing industries including advanced manufacturing, non-retail food and beverage, defense, clean energy and life sciences can receive a tax credit award equal to the lesser of 0.1% of the eligible business’s total capital investment multiplied by the number of new full-time jobs, or 25% of the eligible business’s total qualified investment (subject to a total cap of $150 per project).

In the first two years, $100 million in tax credits will be reserved for clean energy product manufacturers in sectors such as solar, geothermal and green hydrogen.

Stackable bonuses are available to companies holding New Jersey Business Certifications, such as Minority and Women Business Enterprises, businesses located in Opportunity Zones, or companies that have collective bargaining agreements or labor harmony agreements in place.

After the first two years of the program, any unused proceeds will roll over into the general manufacturing allocation.

A critical time

The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program comes at a critical time — amid a focus on onshoring and reshoring American manufacturing, which has become one of the few topics that brings the two political parties together.

Murphy recounted the state’s manufacturing heritage. He said that the story of American manufacturing is far from over. And is, in fact, at the dawn of a new era; pointing to MAC Products. “Look no further than right here, a family-owned manufacturer with more than 60 years of history,” said Murphy. “Today, their technology powers NJ Transit, Amtrak, PATH, and mass transit systems across the country. And MAC Products employs a highly skilled, specialized workforce – of a caliber that you will only find in our region. And many of the company’s tremendous employees are here with us today.

“And … many of them have been here for a long time – measured in decades. For some of you, your adult children have followed in your footsteps and are now pursuing their own careers right here. Your stories prove that the promise of good-paying, family-supporting manufacturing jobs is still very real in New Jersey. And with the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program, which today’s legislation will create, we’re going to make sure that more families get to live that promise – not just remember it fondly.”

Murphy noted that this program will incent companies around the globe – especially those facing the risk of new tariffs – to manufacture next-generation products, such as cutting-edge pharmaceuticals and renewable energy components, right here in the Garden State.

“And beyond attracting global investment, this program will help local companies grow, create jobs, and unleash a more prosperous future for our children,” said Murphy.

Rooted in NJ

MAC Products President Eddie Russnow spoke about his company’s history, roots and growth in Jersey.

“We have been doing this now for over 60 years. My father-in-law, who’s in the audience today, is the founder. He started this business 60 years ago,” said Russnow of Ed Gollob. “And sitting next to him is my son, Henry. So, he’s the third generation of the business, which as my wife tells me – he’s my retirement plan.

“Our company started with three people when my father-in-law started the business. And at that time, all we were doing were making lugs and connectors, which are used to terminate wires and cables for electrical power products,” Russnow explained. “But over the years, this company has evolved tremendously, as you can see from this heavy technical product that we currently manufacture. And this is just one of about 14 different verticals or product lines that we design, manufacture – and, in some cases, maintain for our customers.”

Russnow stressed the company’s strong commitment to the Garden State.

“As I said before, we’ve been here for 60 years – and we plan to be here for a minimum of 60 more,” he said. “This is why we have multiple generations of the family in the business. And it’s truly not just our family that has multi-generations in this business.”

‘Ought to be a no-brainer’

Among the various officials, business leaders and lawmakers on hand, the spirit of bipartisanship – and even nonpartisanship – was on full display.

“This is a really important piece of legislation – and again, as the governor noted, bipartisan – almost nonpartisan,” said NJEDA Chief Executive Officer Tim Sullivan. “For the notion that American manufacturing, Jersey manufacturing ought to be a no-brainer. And I think under this governor’s leadership; really strong support from the Manufacturing Caucus, this is not a new theme.”

Sullivan noted the investment of more than $66 million for the New Jersey Manufacturing Voucher Program as an example of the administration’s focus in this sector.

“But with this bill today, we’re just getting warmed up. It’s going to make the Manufacturing Voucher Program look like the early innings. Half a billion dollars of capital deployed to the manufacturing sector – that’s going to help create thousands more new manufacturing jobs, on top of that first 7,000 or so under this governor’s leadership,” said Sullivan. He stressed that as with all of the NJEDA’s tax credit programs, the companies need to stick to their commitments. “If you promise you’re going to do something, and you do it, you get the tax credits. If you don’t – you don’t get the tax credits. This is money on the table that encourages and incentivizes people to make the investments that they want to make, particularly in this context – manufacturers.”

At the bill signing, officials noted how quickly they planned to ramp the program up. In August, the NJEDA sought public input on draft rules, which it will present to the NJEDA board for review and consideration for approval. If approved, the rules will be published in the New Jersey Register for formal public comment.

‘Upward mobility’

Sen. Mike Testa, R-1st District, co-chair of the Manufacturing Caucus, was a prime sponsor of the bill. “I stand before each and every one of you extremely grateful today,” Testa said at the ceremony. “The people want to see government work. This is a prime example of government actually working on a nonpartisan basis – not a bipartisan basis.”

As Testa thanked the officials gathered for their efforts in getting this legislation over the finish line, he recounted a story about a woman he met in Atlantic City after he had given a speech about manufacturing.

This is a prime example of government actually working on a nonpartisan basis – not a bipartisan basis.

– Sen. Mike Testa, R-1st District

“And she said – ‘my two sons don’t need jobs,’” Testa recounted, asking her what she meant. “She said – ‘my two boys need careers.’ And I take a look at the people that work at MAC – and they’re here for over two decades. And I look at manufacturing – they are careers with extreme upward mobility.

“Manufacturing is important. And lord knows the governor and I don’t agree on a whole lot,” said Testa, who has been critical of the administration. “But we’re friends and we respect each other. And one of the aspects that Gov. Murphy has knocked it out of the park is in advanced manufacturing. Otherwise, we would not be here today.”

Testa spoke about a picture he has hanging in his office of the infamous “Trenton Makes – The World Takes” sign.

“This bill will go a long way to making sure that means something once again – and remains meaning something 50, 60, 75 years to come,” said Testa. “And this bill goes a long way to ensure that.”

Murphy added after Testa spoke, “And I would echo something Michael said – we’re not going to agree on a whole list of stuff. People would be shocked how close the two of us are privately. And that’s, I hope, a good lesson that just because you disagree on a bunch of stuff doesn’t mean you can’t find common ground in fellowship.”

‘Powerful example’

Sen. Linda Greenstein, D-14th District, co-chair of the Manufacturing Caucus, was also a prime bill sponsor. “This is a wonderful day to be here in New Jersey,” said Greenstein. “We do a lot of legislation, but we don’t always do a piece of legislation as wonderful as this one.”

She noted how much she has learned about manufacturing and its importance in the state over the years – from her late husband’s career in the field to learning from Peter Connolly and John Kennedy at the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program.

We do a lot of legislation, but we don’t always do a piece of legislation as wonderful as this one.

– Sen. Linda Greenstein, D-14th District

“I remember the first time I went to an MEP meeting – and I truly didn’t realize that manufacturing was as prevalent in the State of New Jersey as it is. And I was shocked to hear about the large numbers of companies and all the different things that are being manufactured right here in New Jersey,” said Greenstein. “So, I think we can serve as a national model because we don’t really have to bring it back.

“We have it here. And this program will help us to really keep up the great work that New Jersey does in manufacturing. I look forward to seeing this bill in action.”

U.S. Rep. Rob Menendez, D-8th District, said, “The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program is a powerful example of how our state is leading the way on creating good jobs and investing in local businesses. Manufacturing is a vital part of our economy and I’m grateful to Gov. Murphy and our partners in state government for prioritizing this initiative.”

Building the workforce

Business leaders across the state applauded the new program, many of whom were on hand for the bill signing in Kearny.

“NJMEP is prepared to stand alongside NJEDA and every business this program attracts to offer targeted training, consulting, and workforce development,” said NJMEP Chief Executive Officer Connolly. “With this robust support in place, this $500 million incentive can translate into real high-quality jobs and tangible economic opportunity for the people of New Jersey.”

New Jersey Business & Industry Association President and CEO Michele Siekerka said the law represents a significant and targeted investment for New Jersey’s manufacturing sector and the economy — with no additional funding required.

“It will support much-needed workforce development in manufacturing amid both federal tariff and supply chain uncertainty that challenges these important businesses,” said Siekerka. “And it will incentivize a wide range of manufacturing activities, including advancing manufacturing, food and beverage production, life sciences, defense, and clean energy component manufacturing.

“NJBIA thanks Gov. Murphy for signing this important bill into law, as well as the overwhelming bipartisan support within the Legislature. Let’s get to work.”

Growing the industry

Tom Bracken, New Jersey Chamber of Commerce president and CEO, said this investment reflects the state’s commitment to supporting growth in manufacturing.

“The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program aims to encourage innovation, attract new industries, and expand career opportunities in the state,” said Bracken. “By combining targeted tax incentives with the strengths of our workforce, we’re creating a stronger environment for businesses to build and grow in the Garden State.”

“New Jersey’s manufacturers are the backbone of our economy, and this program provides the kind of bold, targeted investment needed to keep them competitive in a rapidly changing economic landscape,” said Christina Renna, president and CEO, Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey. “By prioritizing innovation, job creation, and in-state capital investment, the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program sends a clear message: our state is serious about building things here at home and supporting manufacturers up and down the state.”

Made in NJ

“As the ‘Medicine Chest of the World,’ New Jersey relies on a strong manufacturing ecosystem to produce highly advanced technologically sophisticated, and life-saving biopharma and medical device products,” said Chrissy Buteas, CEO, HealthCare Institute of New Jersey. “These products – from cell and gene manufacturing to complex metallurgic bone mesh implants to radioligand therapeutic products – are made in New Jersey because of our skilled, well-trained workforce and incentives like the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program Act.”

Russnow added, that as a family business that lives by the motto “We Don’t Do Easy,” his company understands the importance of resilient, in-state manufacturing capacity.

“The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program will propel local investment, fuel job creation, and reinforce the innovation and integrity at the heart of our operations – and the operations of manufacturers across the state.”",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/08/NEXTNJ7GovTesta.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 11:04:31.754309

The investment will support the launch of the first 6,000 acres and expand the initiative across the southern US. The program currently operates across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.

The agreement will see Netflix provide partial funding as acres are planted and trees grown, with the remaining funds provided once the carbon credits are verified. The investment amount and number of carbon credits tied to the agreement were not disclosed. DCD has reached out for further information.

“Netflix’s partnership shows what’s possible when business and nature come together. With the right investment and science, natural climate solutions can be both a powerful and credible tool to address our most pressing conservation challenges,” said John Ringer, senior director of project finance and environmental markets at AFF. “We’re grateful for Netflix's leadership, and we invite other companies to follow their lead by investing in new approaches that support America’s rural communities and family-owned forests.”

The project already covers approximately 2,500 acres, with more than 1.4 million trees planted. AFF aims to expand the program to 75,000 acres by 2032, which it claims could generate up to 4.8 million carbon credits.

In addition to generating carbon credits, the project aims to have a positive impact on local landowners. The project is designed exclusively for small-acreage landowners who have historically been excluded from the voluntary carbon market due to high upfront costs and programmatic complexity. To support accessibility, AFF has committed to covering all site preparation and tree planting costs, as well as providing landowners with technical support and annual payments throughout the 30-year contract.

The purchase by Netflix is part of the company's broader effort to decarbonize its value chain. Currently, more than 95 percent of its associated emissions are Scope 3, primarily from cloud services, content production, and supply chains. Its Scope 3 emissions have surged over recent years, rising from 843,107 tons CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) in 2023 to 986,738 tCO2e in 2024, a 23 percent increase.

AWS is Netflix’s primary cloud provider, with the company moving all its back-office services to AWS servers in 2016. Previously, it had operated its own service through a small portfolio of data centers.

Since launching the Sustainable Card Program in 2018, to date, one billion Mastercard cards have been made from more sustainable materials such as recycled plastics, agricultural waste and sugar-based polymers.

This progress complements a digital-first strategy that will reduce the need for physical cards over time.

Standards and partnerships that scale impact

Momentum is building across the network: more than 330 issuers in 80 countries have joined the programme, including 90 issuers across 15 Asia Pacific markets.

Working with major card manufacturers, Mastercard has already transitioned more than 168 million cards, more than 31 million in Asia Pacific, to recycled and bio-based inputs like rPVC, rPET and PLA.

From 2028, all newly produced cards on the network must meet a certification standard, with third-party validation of materials and sustainability claims.

Eligible cards can carry a Card Eco Certification mark, helping issuers and consumers identify credible, lower-impact options.

“Mastercard is committed to advancing climate action and reducing waste by driving our business toward net zero emissions and leveraging our network and scale to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, regenerative economy,” says Ellen Jackowski, Chief Sustainability Officer for Mastercard.

Decarbonising payment methods

Reducing plastic use is only part of the equation.

Mastercard is accelerating digital-first issuance, tokenisation and wallet-based experiences that can eliminate the need for a physical card altogether, cutting material use, manufacturing emissions and end-of-life waste while maintaining security and convenience.

Industry collaborations, including the Greener Payments Partnership with leading manufacturers, are reshaping supply chains to phase out virgin PVC and scale circular materials.

“The world has a plastic problem,"" says Sandeep Malhotra, Executive Vice President, Products & Innovation, Asia Pacific, Mastercard.

""Solving it will be a whole-of-society task, yet efforts are often taken in isolation or without coordination.

“With this sustainable cards effort, Mastercard is bringing its global network of banks, financial institutions and consumers, who collectively hold more than three billion Mastercard cards, together to build a greener payments sector through collaboration and partnership.”

Climate, nature and inclusion

Mastercard’s broader sustainability platform targets climate action, nature restoration and inclusive growth.

The company is progressing toward net zero emissions by 2040, mobilising partners through the Priceless Planet Coalition to restore 100 million trees by 2025 across 18 global projects and enabling consumer engagement with the Mastercard Carbon Calculator developed with Doconomy.

Building a more sustainable digital economy also means expanding access.

The company is advancing toward bringing one billion people into the digital economy by 2025 and supporting 50 million small and micro businesses, including 25 million women entrepreneurs.

By redesigning a ubiquitous product, setting clear standards and activating a global network, Mastercard is translating sustainability goals into tangible results, shrinking plastic footprints today while accelerating a digital, low-carbon payments future.

Collaborating for sustainability

Bringing sustainability to The Open helps to reflect how Mastercard is turning big stages and everyday transactions into climate action.

In 2022, Mastercard supported The Open’s water initiative to cut single-use plastics while channelling funding to the Priceless Planet Coalition, alongside programs that link spending to restoration, such as planting one tree for every fifty transactions on ekko’s “good vibes” debit card and giving WHSmith shoppers a way to back global reforestation.

Beyond events and retail, Mastercard is expanding access to clean energy through a simple PAYG solar model in Uganda as well as improving urban sustainability by partnering with more than 150 cities to make public transport smarter and more efficient.

The company is also accelerating landscape-scale restoration with 15 new Priceless Planet projects across six continents toward a 100 million tree goal and advancing its own climate roadmap by accelerating our net zero timeline and scaling sustainable commerce solutions announced at the UN Climate Change Conference.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/e5c1d078b0bacdd12ff3dc5895affe9d:37651f81438da56626a8f4c0af4bcf55/mastercard-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 06:59:32.220828

Here's what Maine lawmakers can and have done to lower them,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/energy-prices-are-complex-heres-what-maine-lawmakers-can-and-have-done-lower-them,"Republican lawmakers latched onto that stat as evidence that the policies coming out of Augusta are driving up costs for ratepayers in Maine.
However, state energy officials have pushed back against those findings.
Despite some data discrepancies, energy prices have been higher in recent years than they were 10 years ago.
A new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational.
Distribution costs are regulated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and increases can reflect system upgrades like new poles or substations.","Concerns about the high cost of energy were frequently heard in legislative hearings, debates, and throughout the halls of the State House this past session. It’s front of mind for many Mainers as prices have noticeably increased in recent years.

Calls for lawmakers to do more were heard during multiple public hearings before the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee where people lined up to speak for hours, including businesses who feared their livelihood could be in jeopardy over high electricity bills.

It is an issue that Republicans in particular have raised, arguing that state policies that encourage sustainable energy use are to blame.

“The reason Maine ranks so high in electricity rates is because of bad policies passed in our state,” said House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor.

How concerns about energy costs paved way for a prohibition on towns banning heating fuel sources

However, the actual dollar amount ratepayers end up shelling out each month is influenced by a multitude of factors — some of which lawmakers have more control over than others. While the global markets that dictate prices of natural gas and other energy sources are beyond the reach of state senators and representatives, there are some ways that energy costs can be addressed from Augusta.

Misleading data

In early August, new data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration garnered a lot of attention by seeming to indicate that Maine had the biggest increase in the country for residential electricity rates between May 2024 and 2025.

Republican lawmakers latched onto that stat as evidence that the policies coming out of Augusta are driving up costs for ratepayers in Maine.

“Unlike other states, Maine’s leaders have pursued an agenda that prioritizes green mandates and out-of-state profits over affordability for ratepayers,” said Peter Wood (R-Norway) in the Maine House Republican August 22 radio address highlighting that statistics.

However, state energy officials have pushed back against those findings.

Phil Bartlett, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission, said it is hard to understand what methodology was used for that research because that data isn’t consistent with what the state is seeing for customers of the two privately owned utility companies, Central Maine Power and Versant.

“There have been increases over the last several years, but this year it’s actually a little bit less than it was two years ago,” Bartlett said. “It’s been a bit of seesaw in the last few years, but we’ve seen increases in various components of the bills, but it’s more like 10%, not 36%.”

Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said she couldn’t recreate the federal data that showed a 36% increase in average residential rates. She said that her office’s data shows that from June 2024 to June 2025, there was a year-over-year bill increase for residential customers of: 20.7% in CMP territory, 11.9% in Versant Bangor Hydro territory and 15% in Versant Maine Public District.

Sanborn added that smaller, consumer-owned utilities aren’t tracked in the same way, but they also account for less customers, so they wouldn’t skew the data enough to bring it up to 36%.

That data point also doesn’t seem to account for states procuring their energy rates on different schedules. Maine uses a 12-month cycle, but other states could be updating their rates more frequently.

Despite some data discrepancies, energy prices have been higher in recent years than they were 10 years ago. Though, they have been falling since a peak in 2023. And people are calling on lawmakers to do more to stem the cost of electricity at a time when it feels like everyday essentials just keep getting more expensive.

So what can lawmakers do?

Electricity bills can be broken down into a few main cost components. While there is opportunity for the Legislature to address prices in each of these areas, some of that work is already underway but may take time for its impacts to be felt.

Much attention has been given to stranded costs, which is the smallest slice of the price breakdown. Also called public policy costs, stranded costs is a catch-all category that can include the cost of storm recovery, solar incentives and a low-income assistance program.

“If Republicans were in charge, we would start by ending the solar tax known as net energy billing that subsidizes solar panels for the wealthy on the backs of Maine ratepayers,” Faulkingham said.

During the last legislative session, there was a push to reform or even repeal the state’s solar incentive program, called net energy billing, which critics like Faulkingham said would reduce electricity bills for ratepayers. While there was broad consensus the program needed to be adjusted, some didn’t agree with making it a scapegoat for the cost hike people experienced.

The average customer was paying about one cent per kilowatt-hour for policy costs over the past couple years, Bartlett said, with the typical Maine residence using about 550 kilowatt-hours each month. That jumped to 1.7 cents in 2025, which is a real increase, but not what’s driving the total people see on their bills, he added.

“The suggestion that we’re seeing these wild increases because of those policy costs… just the math doesn’t work,” Bartlett said.

In June, Gov. Janet Mills signed legislation into law to reform net energy billing and rein in future costs it could impose on ratepayers. While the cost of the program is expected to exceed $234 million this year alone, the new law is projected to save Maine electricity customers more than $1.2 billion over the next 16 years, according to a news release from the Maine Public Advocate’s Office after its passage.

Much more significant to one’s energy bill than those stranded costs is the supply rate, which reflects the cost of what actually generates the power.

“New England has historically had higher electricity prices than the U.S. average, driven by the region’s heavy reliance on natural gas to produce electricity,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office.

Especially in recent years, this has driven up costs for consumers because the cost of natural gas itself is subject to national and global events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

While Maine lawmakers can’t control those global market fluctuations, some believe that pursuing more sources of in-state and in-region renewable energy could offer more stable prices.

Earlier this year, the governor signed legislation that will transition the current Governor’s Energy Office into the Department of Energy Resources. That new cabinet-level entity will have the authority to do clean energy procurements, which could help transition the state away from volatile natural gas and fossil fuel prices.

A new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational. That would have translated to about $400 million in savings for ratepayers throughout New England, the study found. However, the Trump administration took action early on to pause the development of offshore wind projects, leaving plans to put turbines in the Gulf of Maine on pause.

The remainder of an electric bill is the cost to deliver the electricity to the end user.

That can be broken down into transmission costs, which are regulated federally, and distribution costs, which is the price of taking energy from the bulk transmission system to the poles and wires that reach people’s homes.

Transmission prices have increased over the past decade to cover the cost of system upgrades that are passed onto ratepayers. Because New England states share a regional grid called ISO-New England, those jumps have been seen across the region.

Distribution costs are regulated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and increases can reflect system upgrades like new poles or substations.

Because of a law passed in 2022, utility companies are required to file a 10-year plan to determine what upgrades will be needed to improve grid reliability and resilience. The plans should also account for the state’s climate policy goals and cost-effectiveness for ratepayers.

Greater attention has been paid to grid resilience after the state faced unprecedented winter storms in 2023 and 2024 that incurred significant costs to ratepayers. In the storms’ wake, Mills established the Infrastructure Rebuilding and Resilience Commission to find ways to shore up the state’s energy systems against future severe storms. The commission’s final report came out in May 2025, highlighting the need to improve the grid, especially as the state moves toward greater electrification of transportation and home heating and cooling systems.

“With more low-cost, local clean energy projects, nation-leading energy efficiency programs, and efforts to strengthen our electric grid against extreme storms, Maine continues to work to protect ratepayers and build a more affordable, resilient energy future,” Burgess said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-100/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cmpbill-1024x7681757321412.jpeg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=cEUdwFJV,N,,2025-09-08 07:00:00.137662

The report’s low-case scenario warns that the U.S. could lose 44 GW of solar deployment by 2030, an 18% decline from previous estimates.
While near-term deployment remains supported by projects already underway, tax credit deadlines, and rising power demand, the low-case forecast projects a 4% reduction in solar deployment relative to pre-HR1 expectations by 2030.
“There is considerable downside risk if federal permitting creates additional constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie.","The US added nearly 18 GW of new solar capacity in the first half of 2025, with solar and storage accounting for 82% of all new power entering the grid, according to the latest report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.

The report’s low-case scenario warns that the U.S. could lose 44 GW of solar deployment by 2030, an 18% decline from previous estimates. Compared with pre-HR1 projections, the country risks a total shortfall of 55 GW, or 21%, by 2030.

“Solar and storage remain the backbone of America’s energy future, supplying the majority of new power at the lowest cost,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “Federal policy changes are stifling investment, raising energy costs, and putting grid reliability at risk. Yet demand for reliable, affordable energy continues to drive industry growth.”

The report notes that 77% of 2025 solar capacity was installed in states won by President Trump, including Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas, which feature among the top 10 states for new solar projects.

In the first half of 2025, the U.S. also added 13 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity, with expansions in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota, bringing total U.S. capacity to 55 GW. However, the report highlights a pause in upstream manufacturing investment in Q2, citing uncertainty over federal policies as a key risk to continued growth.

While near-term deployment remains supported by projects already underway, tax credit deadlines, and rising power demand, the low-case forecast projects a 4% reduction in solar deployment relative to pre-HR1 expectations by 2030.

Recent executive actions, including a Department of the Interior (DOI) order increasing permitting scrutiny for solar projects, could affect approximately 44 GW of planned capacity, particularly in Arizona, California, Utah, and Nevada.

“There is considerable downside risk if federal permitting creates additional constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie. “The industry is navigating rapid policy changes, and uncertainty is increasing operational challenges.”

SEIA has urged DOI Secretary Doug Burgum to reconsider these measures, warning of potential job losses, higher electricity costs, and reduced U.S. competitiveness.

The report also underscores that constrained solar growth could impact the country’s broader technology and AI ambitions, while SEIA continues to advocate for grid reliability policies that integrate solar and storage solutions to meet rising demand.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/saur-energy/media/media_files/2025/09/03/fdre-project-2025-09-03-11-56-13.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 06:59:46.001792

General Motors believes that as competitors gradually exit the electric vehicle market, it is poised to capture a larger share of the electric vehicle market, although the company also stated that it is willing to pursue this goal at a more measured pace.
On the other hand, electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive (RIVN.US) and Tesla (TSLA.US) will face significant revenue losses.","According to the Zhitong Finance APP, U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing to eliminate the federal car purchase incentive policy and relax emissions regulations, a move that is bringing billions of dollars in 'dividends' to Detroit automakers, who are currently refocusing their investments on gasoline vehicles.

General Motors (GM.US) announced last week that it will cut electric vehicle (hereinafter referred to as 'EV') production plans at two factories, while renovating a third factory to cease producing electric trucks and instead manufacture gasoline pickup trucks. Ford Motor (F.US) will reallocate funds originally intended for a canceled three-row electric SUV to future gasoline and hybrid vehicle projects; meanwhile, Jeep's parent company Stellantis NV has even restarted production of the high-consumption Hemi V-8 engine.

Although these regulatory relaxations have not yet been finalized, they have cleared obstacles for traditional automakers in Detroit and their established competitors, allowing them to reallocate billions of dollars originally intended for EV research and compliance with emissions regulations. Since 2022, General Motors has spent a total of $3.5 billion purchasing so-called 'regulatory credits' to meet fuel economy and emissions requirements; if Trump's policies are implemented, the demand for such credits will significantly decrease.

Coincidentally, Ford Motor has reduced its commitment to regulatory credit purchases by nearly $1.5 billion this year, with those funds now planned to be reinvested into the research and production of gasoline and hybrid vehicles.

Ford CEO Jim Farley recently told analysts that this policy adjustment 'is expected to create billions of dollars in opportunities for the company over the next two years.'

Among the $3.4 trillion fiscal plan proposed by Trump, there is a clear provision to terminate the $7,500 tax credit policy for EV purchasers on September 30; simultaneously, the plan cancels fines for automakers failing to meet fuel economy standards, meaning that automakers will no longer need to purchase regulatory credits to comply with relevant regulations. Over the past two years, Stellantis NV has had to pay $190 million in fines annually.

General Motors Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson revealed to investors last month: ""The cancellation of the penalty policy will undoubtedly save us a substantial amount of money in 2026 and beyond.""

Additionally, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed to revoke strict regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, and Trump has signed legislation effectively terminating similar emission regulations previously set by California.

Farley noted during the company's second-quarter earnings call: ""The EPA's decision and its stance have triggered a significant shift in the U.S. automotive industry."" He believes that the biggest beneficiary of this policy adjustment will be Ford's ""Ford Blue"" division, which is responsible for producing gasoline and hybrid vehicles—this division has faced heavy compliance pressures under previous emission regulations.

Currently, Ford is working to retrofit its plant in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, with plans to start producing the Super Duty series gasoline pickups there next year. Previously, this plant was intended for electric vehicle production, but due to weak demand for electric vehicles, Ford shelved that plan last year.

Critics have strongly condemned Trump's actions, arguing that they undermine policies aimed at controlling automotive pollution—the automotive industry is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global warming. During the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, the EPA stated that strict emission regulations could reduce approximately 7 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the policy's effective period (a scale exceeding the total annual carbon emissions of the United States) while saving vehicle owners about $6,000 in fuel and maintenance costs.

Dan Becker, head of the ""Safe Climate Transportation Campaign"" at the Center for Biodiversity, stated in a July announcement: ""The EPA is now rolling back the most critical measures that countries around the world have taken to save oil, reduce consumer fueling costs, and address global warming.""

However, automakers oppose strict emission regulations, arguing that these standards are overly stringent, forcing companies to produce plug-in models far exceeding market demand. Jacobson remarked at a JPMorgan meeting: ""I would be surprised if the number of electric vehicle retailers or sellers does not decrease in the next four to five years.""

General Motors believes that as competitors gradually exit the electric vehicle market, it is poised to capture a larger share of the electric vehicle market, although the company also stated that it is willing to pursue this goal at a more measured pace. Last week, General Motors announced that its plant in Kansas, which is scheduled to resume production of the compact electric vehicle Chevrolet Bolt starting in December, will only schedule one shift of workers for production instead of the originally planned two shifts; moreover, due to the slowdown in electric vehicle demand, the company's plant in Tennessee, responsible for producing electric Cadillacs, will also reduce one shift of capacity starting in early 2026.

Trump has promoted the relaxation of emission regulations from multiple angles, and his policy approach towards the automotive industry has become increasingly clear. Similar to his first term, Trump is attempting to create domestic jobs by loosening regulations—a goal also reflected in his aggressive tariff policies: by imposing high tariffs on imported automobiles and parts, he exerts cost pressure on car manufacturers.

It is noteworthy that the short-term cost savings from relaxed environmental regulations for car manufacturers can only offset (but not fully cover) the additional expenses brought about by tariff policies. For instance, Ford Motor has saved approximately $1.5 billion on regulatory credits so far this year, which nearly offsets the projected $2 billion net profit loss for the entire year of 2025 due to tariffs; meanwhile, General Motors has indicated that the tariff policy will impose about $3 billion in costs annually, a figure that far exceeds the company's average annual environmental compliance expenses of approximately $730 million since 2022.

On the other hand, electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive (RIVN.US) and Tesla (TSLA.US) will face significant revenue losses. Since 2020, Tesla has earned over $10 billion by selling regulatory credits to other car manufacturers, with over $1 billion earned just this year. JPMorgan analysts estimate that if Trump implements policies unfavorable to electric vehicles, approximately 40% of Tesla's profits could be at risk.

Rivian's Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough stated in August that due to policy changes, the company expects zero revenue from regulatory credit sales for the remainder of the year. In the first half of this year, Rivian generated approximately $160 million in revenue from credit sales, having previously projected total credit sales revenue of $300 million for the year.",https://pubimg.futunn.com/2022050900000141112df209ed9.png,N,,2025-09-08 12:21:00.131591

NORMAN, OK, UNITED STATES, September 8, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- PCI Energy Solutions today announced the launch of a collection of free energy market AI chatbots. These tools are designed to help market participants, analysts, and operators get faster, higher-quality answers to questions about North American ISO/RTO rules, procedures, and business practice manuals. The flagship ISO Bot is trained on key ISO/RTO documentation across all North American markets, with built-in links to download underlying source manuals so users can verify answers instantly.

Unlike general-purpose AI tools, ISO Bot is purpose-built for organized power markets and has been tested to outperform ChatGPT on queries that rely on up-to-date ISO/RTO documentation. It’s maintained by PCI market experts to keep pace with market changes.

“Market rules are nuanced and evolving. Our goal was to make authoritative documentation discoverable and usable in seconds—without sacrificing verifiability,” said David Christopher, Senior Director of Marketing at PCI Energy Solutions. “Chatbots like ISO Bot help new and veteran market participants reduce research time and make decisions faster. Of course, AI can make mistakes, and we encourage users to check answers before acting on them.”

Since the soft launch, PCI has seen strong, organic engagement from utilities and independent power producers who are using the chatbots to speed up onboarding, cross-check their own interpretations, and reduce research time on documentation-dependent questions. As adoption grows, PCI will continue expanding coverage and improving the AI to better answer questions.

“Documentation is the single source of truth in organized markets. We built these AI assistants to respect the manuals, not replace them—pairing speed with provenance,” said Shailesh Mishra, SVP, Commercial & Customer Success at PCI Energy Solutions. “It’s the research tool we wanted on our own desks.”

Because the documentation for emerging programs like SPP Markets+ and ERCOT RTCB is in constant flux, PCI maintains stand-alone AI bots for these initiatives. The M+ Bot helps participants keep pace with evolving SPP Markets+ program rules, while the RTCB Bot is dedicated to ERCOT’s Real-Time Co-Optimization with Batteries initiative. Both bots have been tested in real-world use and are seeing rapid adoption among utilities and IPPs who need authoritative, current guidance on these specific programs.

The Global CCS Institute was started by the Australian government over a decade ago with the mission of accelerating the commercial deployment of carbon capture and storage as a technology essential for tackling climate change. It is an international, member-based think tank. About two-thirds of our members are now governments, both federal and sub-national, and the rest are private companies in the energy and CCS space. Together, we focus on overcoming the critical issues to accelerate CCS deployment worldwide, but with tailored approaches for each region.

CCS has seen strong support in recent years, but also pushback from some quarters. What are your thoughts, and how do you see the future of technologies like carbon capture?

I’ve been working in CCS for around 25 years, first with the US Department of Energy and now at the Global CCS Institute.

Two decades ago, CCS was seen primarily as a way to decarbonise the stationary power sector, when coal still supplied more than half of US electricity and China’s growth was accelerating. The conversation then shifted: the same expertise used to extract oil and gas is needed to return CO2 securely to the subsurface. Oil and gas companies became essential for deploying CCS at the gigatonne scale required by climate science.

In the past five years, heavy industries such as cement and steel have entered the debate. These sectors have no alternative technology pathway. Even if powered entirely by renewable electricity, their processes emit CO2 as an unavoidable by-product. CCS is indispensable for decarbonising such industrial point sources.

The conclusion is unavoidable: whether people like it or not, the mathematics of climate stabilisation demands gigatonnes of CCS deployment, not only at point sources but also through carbon removal technologies such as direct air capture and bioenergy with CCS.

Momentum is building. CCS is increasingly being recognised alongside renewables, efficiency, and, where acceptable, nuclear, as part of a system-wide strategy. The investment community is leaning in; the insurance sector is offering new products; and in the Global South, there is growing interest in ensuring these technologies are not limited to affluent countries but deployed globally.

Is enough being invested in CCS? What are the investment pathways?

In short, no. More investment is urgently needed, not just in CCS but in all forms of low-carbon technologies. Developed societies, governments and the private sector alike, have a responsibility to invest and support those on different stages of the journey.

Demand for energy and industrial products is relatively flat in developed economies, but rising exponentially in developing regions. This creates a unique opportunity to embed low-carbon technologies from the start, whether in power generation or new industrial facilities.

We’re seeing momentum in Southeast Asia and China with projects at megatonne-per-year scale, and in Saudi Arabia with industrial CCS hubs such as Jubail. These projects not only cut emissions but also deliver energy security, industrial resilience, jobs and wider economic benefits. CCS is becoming part of a broader investment strategy to maintain sovereign industrial capacity while lowering carbon footprints.

Looking ahead, what skills will be needed to scale CCS?

The skills gap is significant. Deploying CCS at a climate-rel.evant scale will require expertise across many fields. Engineers will be needed for above-ground capture equipment, while geologists and geophysicists must en.sure safe and permanent storage underground.

Beyond technical roles, we’ll need more project developers, financiers, and project managers because CCS projects are large, capital-intensive endeavours that demand multidisciplinary collaboration.

The next generation will need tremendous skills, not just for CCS but for all forms of clean energy. Digital tools such as AI can help optimise integration, but ultimately this is a human-capital challenge. If we are serious about climate change mitigation, we must invest in people as much as in technology.","https://www.energyconnects.com/media/f4affger/1050x550.jpg?center=0.40789786237526121,0.5278868813825609&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134018006019300000",N,,2025-09-08 06:59:41.956963

Investors had long pressured shale oil companies to reduce reckless expansion, and many firms now have limited high-quality oil well inventories, making them reluctant to increase investments in a low oil price environment.","In the wake of Donald Trump's election victory, several prominent figures in the U.S. oil industry saw their significant political investments yield substantial returns. The new administration swiftly implemented policies that favored the fossil fuel sector, including the opening of federal lands and offshore areas for exploration and drilling, the approval of new liquefied natural gas export terminals, and the rollback of numerous environmental regulations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act further bolstered the industry by providing significant tax benefits, thereby solidifying their support for the Trump administration.

The energy sector, which had been a major financial backer of Trump's campaign, witnessed immediate policy shifts that aligned with their interests. The opening of federal lands and offshore areas for drilling and exploration presented new opportunities for resource extraction, while the approval of new liquefied natural gas export terminals facilitated increased exports, potentially boosting profits for energy companies.

The rollback of environmental regulations was another critical policy change that benefited the energy sector. Many of these regulations had been viewed as burdensome and costly for oil and gas companies, and their removal allowed for more efficient and profitable operations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which included substantial corporate tax cuts, further benefited the energy sector by reducing their tax burden and enhancing profitability.

These policy changes were seen as a direct result of the energy sector's political investments. The industry had spent millions of dollars on political contributions and lobbying efforts, and these investments appeared to have paid off with favorable policy changes. The energy sector's support for Trump's campaign was viewed as a strategic move to ensure that their interests were represented in the new administration, and the subsequent policy changes demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach.

Despite the policy benefits, the financial performance of energy companies did not fully align with these gains. Increased international oil supply and higher costs due to tariffs led to a decline in oil prices, resulting in reduced market values and job cuts. The current oil price of 62 dollars per barrel is below the break-even point for many small and medium-sized enterprises, significantly lower than when Trump took office. However, many executives believe that these short-term challenges are worth enduring.

The White House emphasized that the oil and gas industry is a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, providing millions of high-paying jobs, and that the administration is fulfilling its promise to restore U.S. energy dominance. Environmentalists, however, criticized these measures, arguing that they would increase energy costs, exacerbate climate change, and weaken the U.S. position in the renewable energy sector.

Key figures in the energy sector, such as the executive chairman of an energy transportation company and the former CEO of a major energy firm, were significant fundraisers for Trump's campaign. Their contributions, totaling over 1300 million dollars, helped secure approvals for stalled projects, such as a liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana. The Trump administration also eliminated electric vehicle subsidies, providing the traditional energy industry with tens of billions of dollars in tax relief. Companies like ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, Occidental Petroleum, and Devon Energy are expected to save over 12 billion dollars in taxes by 2025 alone.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to repeal a 2009 climate regulation that recognized greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and provided a legal basis for emissions monitoring. Industry lobbying groups praised this move, while environmental organizations vowed to challenge it in court.

In contrast to the Trump administration, the energy sector faced difficulties during the Biden administration, often feeling sidelined by environmental policies. Now, industry executives frequently meet with the president and influence policy directions. The American Petroleum Institute noted that their pre-election policy proposals were largely implemented by the Trump administration.

On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to boost production in Alaska. The Department of Energy also adjusted regulations to facilitate access for companies like ConocoPhillips to the resource-rich Arctic Circle. However, wind and solar energy projects faced stricter approval processes, and related tax incentives were revoked. Clean energy companies expressed concern that these policies would hinder the U.S. from keeping pace with China in the next wave of energy demand driven by artificial intelligence.

While Trump encouraged increased drilling, oil companies prioritized capital discipline. Investors had long pressured shale oil companies to reduce reckless expansion, and many firms now have limited high-quality oil well inventories, making them reluctant to increase investments in a low oil price environment. Trump's desire for oil prices to drop below 40 dollars per barrel to control inflation and support his foreign policy goals was met with caution from executives, who warned that excessively low prices could lead to bankruptcies and reduced production.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 11:05:38.081246

That spending comes amid a wave of policy wins for fossil fuel interests—and significant setbacks for environmental and green energy groups.
That’s more than half of what it spent in all of 2024 combined—the industry’s biggest year in over a decade.
And with about $71 million already spent on lobbying this year, the oil and gas industry continues to significantly outpace the renewable industry’s lobbying expenditures of roughly $40 million.
“Despite the highly polarized environment, a group of Republican senators came forward to support the core interests of the clean energy industry,” Grumet said.","The energy and natural resource sector has spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying the federal government so far this year, according to data compiled by the nonprofit OpenSecrets.

That spending comes amid a wave of policy wins for fossil fuel interests—and significant setbacks for environmental and green energy groups.

Nearly $240 million poured in during the first and second quarters of 2025, with about 2,200 lobbyists representing the sector—nearly half of whom are former government employees themselves. That spending puts the sector slightly ahead of last year’s pace, when its yearly total reached $435 million.

This year’s expenditures make energy and natural resources the fifth-largest lobbying sector that OpenSecrets tracked over this period—ahead of transportation, defense and labor.

Electric utilities represented the largest share of those expenditures, totaling nearly $75 million.

That’s more than half of what it spent in all of 2024 combined—the industry’s biggest year in over a decade.

And with about $71 million already spent on lobbying this year, the oil and gas industry continues to significantly outpace the renewable industry’s lobbying expenditures of roughly $40 million.

The totals for oil and gas so far this year put the industry slightly below the pace of last year’s expenditures, which totaled over $150 million—its highest since 2009.

However, watchdog organizations say the industry’s steady funding is actually the result of its existing influence within the federal government.

“When you’ve got a White House that has made clear that they’re going to do whatever you want, you don’t have to spend as much money to get results,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program. “They had to spend more when you had bipartisan, shared control over government, and you didn’t have a rubber stamp in the Oval Office. Now they do.”

Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration and Republicans in Congress have pushed through a slew of regulatory and legislative measures fulfilling the priorities of fossil fuel interests, often at the expense of renewables.

The party’s signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has been criticized as a handout to the fossil fuel industry that increases lease sales for drilling and mandates that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining.

Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, told CNBC at the time that the bill “includes almost all of our priorities.”

The administration has also granted Clean Air Act exemptions to dozens of fossil fuel-burning power plants, delaying their need to reduce emissions of mercury and other air toxins.

And the EPA’s announcement that it intends to rescind its “endangerment finding” for greenhouse gases would remove the basis for its ability to regulate emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations.

These moves have come amid a reversal of government support for renewable energy projects. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act included a phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar that critics say runs counter to the administration’s goal of achieving “energy dominance.”

Wind energy, in particular, has been singled out as a target by the administration. Trump issued a presidential memorandum on his first day in office halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects. The administration later took the unusual step of issuing stop-work orders for some offshore wind projects that were already under construction.

Multiple watchdog organizations told Inside Climate News that the real source of the fossil fuel industry’s current influence stems in part from industry insiders who have been strategically placed into key government positions. That list includes Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, and a range of political appointees with ties to the industry within the EPA.

In an emailed statement, a White House spokesperson did not directly address concerns about administration officials’ ties to fossil fuel interests, but said that “President Trump has kept his Day One promise to unleash American energy, protecting our national security and lowering costs for families and businesses.”

According to Robert Maguire, vice president for research and data at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, those ties have meant that the fossil fuel industry hasn’t had to increase spending on lobbying to secure key wins.

“This has been a hallmark of both [of] Trump’s terms, where essentially he fills his administration with lobbyists and industry officials who, in many cases, have no government experience,” Maguire said. “Their only qualifications for the jobs that he’s putting them in is the fact that they want to do the industry’s bidding within the government.”

A source within the oil and gas industry, however, downplayed the effect of the “revolving door” of industry insiders gaining positions within the government, and instead emphasized that Trump came into office with an already-friendly attitude toward oil and gas.

The source, who requested anonymity to speak freely on the topic, said that industry lobbyists have had conversations with people in government who are “more engaged or more willing to talk for any number of reasons,” saying that there is “expertise” within the current administration on matters tied to the oil and gas industry that didn’t exist during the Biden administration.

Although the source emphasized that the industry has still fought difficult policy battles this year, including over tax credits for clean hydrogen projects, they said that this expertise has meant that industry lobbyists haven’t needed to spend as much effort educating lawmakers or officials on key issues.

Utilities, meanwhile, continue to have a “massive” amount of influence in D.C., according to David Pomerantz, executive director of the watchdog Energy and Policy Institute.

But he noted that far fewer utility insiders have been appointed to positions within the federal government during Trump’s second term.

And unlike the oil and gas industry, the agendas of various utility companies are more complex, and sometimes reveal significant differences between what utilities want and what the Trump administration wants.

“Where the utilities are lobbying for policies or regulatory changes that will allow them to burn more coal and gas, they’re successful,” Pomerantz said.

“The EPA basically said, ‘If you want waivers so that you do not have to comply with pollution limits, all you have to do is send us an email.’”

Still, Pomerantz said that not all utility companies sought out those exemptions—and that some utilities have also lobbied unsuccessfully against some of the Trump administration’s anti-renewables policies.

“Even [with] their considerable political power notwithstanding, the utilities have tried … to prevent some of the worst attacks on wind and solar,” Pomerantz said, “and they’ve basically failed at every turn.”

Although the renewable energy industry continues to lag behind oil and gas, its spending so far of roughly $40 million puts it on pace to eclipse last year’s record of $63.7 million.

This year’s spikes are driven in part by massive increases from the renewable industry’s top spender—the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

ACP’s expenditures in the second quarter of 2025 alone, which reached $3.8 million, were nearly twice the amount the trade association spent in all of 2024 combined.

The $4.3 million it has spent so far this year places it ahead of any of the oil and gas industry’s trade associations. The American Petroleum Institute, by comparison, spent just under $4 million, while American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers spent less than $3 million

But Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, suggested that ACP’s efforts have been unsuccessful.

“The American Clean Power Association sort of is on the outside looking in, and I’m not sure that any amount of money is going to be able to overcome this,” he said.

Slocum also said that the association had “badly misjudged their strategy” by assuming they could appeal to both Democrats and Republicans.

“They thought that they could build a bipartisan appeal for renewable energy, and you see that with a few senators like [Chuck] Grassley and [Lisa] Murkowski, but for the most part, you know, mainstream Republicans just do not want to challenge Trump publicly,” Slocum said.

In an emailed statement, ACP suggested that its efforts on Capitol Hill helped the renewable energy industry avert even worse outcomes—and defended the association’s attempts to build bridges with key Republican legislators.

“The ability to successfully remove the destructive excise tax [from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act] and secure a more reasonable phase out of clean energy tax credits required a sophisticated response to underscore the impact of these policies on consumers and the communities we represent,” said Jason Grumet, the CEO of ACP.

“Despite the highly polarized environment, a group of Republican senators came forward to support the core interests of the clean energy industry,” Grumet said. “Securing this support for provisions that the entire Republican caucus originally voted against is an important accomplishment.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2223443093-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 05:58:47.262312

The $200 million brings Catalyze’s capital raise this year to more than $700 million, including investments from ATLAS SP Partners and RBC. Deutsche Bank, which recently announced it was holding strong on decarbonization goals despite recent pushbacks against the energy transition by the Trump Administration and other socioeconomic trends, is intended to bolster the Catalyze project rollout across the U.S.

Catalyze, which is headquartered in Houston, has developed multiple renewable and DER projects across the U.S., including standalone battery storage in the Bronx, New York, as well as community solar in southern California and western New York state.

“This HoldCo facility represents a pivotal step, enabling us to invest across our enterprise, accelerate growth, and deepen our capacity to deliver clean energy at speed and scale,” said Catalyze CEO Jared Haines in a statement. “The alignment with Deutsche Bank reflects confidence in our business model and positions us to unlock significant value for our investors, customers, and the communities we serve.”

The Deutsche facility is a three-year HoldCo revolving and term debt and letter of credit. A HoldCo facility is financing led by the holding company which owns the assets, allowing the portfolio company to raise more funds without increasing its leveraged debt load, according to various business websites. It offers liquidity to accelerate project development.

Some global banks or private equity firms, especially in the U.S., have toned down their energy transition promises. Recently, however, Germany’s Deutsche Bank announced it would stay committed to its net zero goals by 2050 and steadily cutting its own greenhouse gas emissions.

It also vows to progress decarbonization of its corporate loan portfolio, involving companies in most industrial sectors including cement, steel, oil and gas, automotives and power generation.

And while the U.S. utility-scale grid may be stressed and in dire need of capital investment, the nation may fix some of that at the edge with more than 217 GW of DER capacity before the end of the decade, according to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.

LONDON — Surging power demand has reignited interest in nuclear energy, but vast capital requirements and an uncertain political and regulatory climate raise questions about the sector's fiscal capacity.

Tech giants are pumping money into nuclear energy investments, looking to power energy-intensive data centers and realize their AI ambitions.

AI and data centers are the ""canary in the coal mine,"" World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y León told CNBC ahead of the conference. ""We are finally recognizing that the demand of electricity and energy in general is only going to increase. But the reality is that all sectors of the economy are going to need more electricity.""

In addition to AI, applications range from nuclear energy for the metallurgical industry, which is looking to electrify as fast as possible, to the chemical, maritime and shipping sectors, León said.

The question of how to meet the world's growing power needs took center stage as chief executives of the world's biggest uranium and nuclear energy firms, experts and investors gathered for the annual World Nuclear Association (WNA) symposium at the Royal Lancaster London hotel last week.

World Nuclear Association

Kicking off discussions at the conference, Leon told attendees in her welcoming speech that the event is a ""working summit"" looking to move past mere conversation.

Investments in the nuclear value chain through 2025 are projected to increase to $2.2 trillion, according to Morgan Stanley estimates, up from a 2024 forecast of $1.5 trillion. That level of investment raises questions over the role of government, banks and other financial players in providing sufficient fiscal capacity.

Investment challenges

Nuclear energy is said to provide a more reliable, 24/7 energy source compared to renewables, which can be more intermittent. The development of small modular reactors (SMRs) provides a more scalable power solution due to their size. According to the IEA, the payback period of a SMR investment is half the usual 20 to 30-year period for larger scale projects.

But SMRs have yet to reach the commercial stage, and most planned projects won't come online until 2030. While a significant amount of money is being pledged, there have been no new large-scale nuclear projects in the U.S. in the last 15 years.

""The first positive story with respect to the financial sector with regards to nuclear, is that they are open to financing nuclear,"" Mahesh Goenka, founder of market and commercial advisory firm Old Economy, told CNBC on the sidelines of WNA. ""That was not the story a few years ago when a lot of banks didn't want to touch nuclear projects. That has changed. The question now remains, do they have the risk appetite to finance nuclear projects?""

Challenges include over-running budgets, the late delivery of projects due to long construction lead times, the technical complexity of initiatives and difficulties obtaining licenses.

Goenka compared the West to China, where financial institutions are happy to finance nuclear projects because they can be delivered on time and on budget — leading to better margins than on other infrastructure projects. Meanwhile, the West has not built many new reactors in a very long time, so the learning rate is not quite there yet, he said.

Nearly all of the nuclear generating capacity in the U.S. comes from reactors built between 1967 and 1990, with no new constructions until 2013 when work started on the Vogtle units in Georgia. Meanwhile, the last plant to be built in the U.K. was Sizewell B, which started operating in 1995.

Nuclear investments are ""inherently political projects,"" said Mark Muldowney, managing director of energy, resources and infrastructure at BNP Paribas. He noted that, while clients are much more receptive to the investments, uncertainty over cost and build time remains.

""We are many years away from the situation in which techniques like project finance can be used by themselves to finance large nuclear [projects],"" he said during a panel discussion.

""It's not going to be the contractors, even if they were willing to, and by and large they aren't, they will be bankrupted by some of the risks that sit with these projects. So it's either going to be a government, or it's going to be the electricity consumers of that country, and in some places that could be intermediated by utilities.""

Government backstop still required

Nuclear power plants are among the most capital intensive assets. The U.K., for example, has greenlit the construction of a massive two-reactor nuclear power station on the Suffolk coast that will generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity — enough, the government says, to provide power for the equivalent of 6 million homes. But costs of the majority government-owned project have jumped to £38 billion, exceeding an initial target of £20 billion.

Other major projects have run into similar issues. The Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro, Georgia, ran several years behind schedule and had a budget that more than doubled during development. The U.K.'s Hinkley Point nuclear power point faced many concerns around security risks during its initial stages, as well as a budget that swelled to an estimated £40 billion.

Trevor Myburgh, senior executive in corporate finance advisory at Eskom, stressed that the private sector cannot be a ""silver bullet"" and solve the problem of financing nuclear energy.

Public private partnerships are going to be ""crucial"" in the development of nuclear, particularly in any emerging economy, Myburgh said during a panel discussion on Wednesday.

While some European countries such as Switzerland — which currently has a ban on the construction of any new nuclear plants but has drafted legislation to lift this motion — and Germany remain adverse to nuclear energy, other governments such as those of the U.K., France, and the U.S. have leaned into the energy source.

Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a number of executive orders designed to fast track the development of nuclear reactors and quadruple nuclear generating capacity by 2025.

Such actions from Trump's administration have put positive nuclear energy policies ""on steroids,"" said Uranium Royalty Corp CEO Scott Melbye.

""What we're seeing are really concrete measures being taken by this administration to spur not only the building of small modular reactors, advanced reactors and large reactors, but [also] in the fuel cycle,"" Melbye told WNA attendees.

Investor Arfa Karani noted the growing interest from the investor community to find opportunities with startups, particularly those that supply nuclear-adjacent tech.

The U.K. government, in particular has adopted a more ""hands-on"" approach in helping founders understand how to invest in clean tech, she said.

""The regulation has to figure itself out. It's no longer a question of, where do we get the capital from? ....because now suddenly it's become a matter of national security and global power and global dominance,"" she told CNBC, adding that commitment Stateside to funding AI and nuclear has meant that ""all the insolvable problems suddenly becomes solvable which is very exciting for nuclear.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108194091-1756968328734-gettyimages-1962138611-UK_SIZEWELL.jpeg?v=1757322690&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-09-08 05:58:50.412959

3 minutes read time.

The Vaal University of Technology (VUT) hosted an insightful presentation titled “Decarbonisation Through Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS): Engineering Pathways, Hydrogen Integration and Africa’s Clean Energy Strategy” by Dr Lord Ugwu on Friday, 5 September 2025, at the VUT main campus auditorium in Vanderbijlpark.

This event followed VUT’s successful launch of the Green Hydrogen Centre of Excellence on Thursday 04 September 2025, during which the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Professor Khaled Abou-El-Hossein, invited Dr Ugwu to deepen the dialogue on hydrogen’s pivotal role in shaping South Africa’s energy future.

The presentation drew a diverse audience, including staff from VUT’s Faculty of Engineering, the Acting Dean, Dr Nolutho Mkhumbeni and team from the Faculty of Applied and Computer Sciences, PhD candidates in Engineering, and laboratory assistants.

Dr Ugwu began by addressing the world’s continued dependency on fossil fuels, which intensifies greenhouse gas accumulation, global warming, and rising global temperatures. He emphasised the urgent need for nations such as South Africa to reassess and redirect their energy strategies towards sustainable and clean alternatives. The discussion covered the various types of hydrogen: grey, blue and green, each with distinct potentials and challenges. He underlined that the long-term goal is a clean hydrogen economy, with green hydrogen offering the most sustainable solution. He detailed methods of hydrogen production, catalytic applications, and integration into industries including transport, chemicals, fertilisers, glass manufacturing, and food and beverages.

Providing a comprehensive overview of CCUS technologies, Dr Ugwu outlined approaches ranging from post-combustion chemical absorption using amine-based solvents to advanced methods such as solid material adsorption, membrane separation, cryogenic separation, and direct air capture. He explained how these technologies capture CO₂ from flue gases, allowing for conditioning, compression, and transport, often via specialised shipping.

Highlighting utilisation pathways, Dr Ugwu explained how captured CO₂ can be repurposed for methanol and synthetic fuel production, urea fertilisers, polymers, mineralisation, and algae cultivation. He noted Africa’s unique potential to lead in clean energy innovations, drawing on its abundant sunshine and natural resources.

Drawing lessons from Canada, recognised as a leader in CCUS and hydrogen integration, Dr Ugwu illustrated how South Africa could adopt similar models in industrial hubs such as Sasol Secunda and Durban Petra. He stressed the importance of supportive policies, fiscal incentives, and carbon pricing frameworks to accelerate adoption of these technologies.

Commending VUT for its bold vision, Dr Ugwu applauded the university’s proactive steps towards becoming a centre of excellence for CCUS and hydrogen research, including ongoing doctoral projects focused on CO₂ capture. This positions VUT as a significant contributor to South Africa’s green economy transition.

In his closing remarks, Professor Khaled emphasised that the clean energy challenge is inherently interdisciplinary, requiring collaboration across faculties. He highlighted that initiatives such as this presentation empower the VUT community to make meaningful contributions to Africa’s clean energy strategy.

The interactive Q&A session revealed keen interest from academics, students, and industry stakeholders, sparking conversations on future collaborations and strategies to address regional pollution challenges.

As Dr Ugwu concluded, Africa stands poised to make significant strides towards a brighter, cleaner future, and VUT is ready to play a pivotal role in this journey.",https://vut.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Vaal-University-of-Technology-VUT-1-scaled.webp,N,,2025-09-08 05:58:57.705519

According to the US Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, the US is at risk of losing 44 GW of solar deployment this year, a 18% decline.

By 2030, deployment could be 55 GW lower than previous forecasts, or a 21% decline, the report noted.

At the same time, despite government pushback, solar and solar storage still accounted for 82% of new power added to the US electricity grid in the first six months of this year.

‘Backbone of America’s energy future’

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,” commented SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardising the reliability of our electric grid.

“But no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.”

More than three quarters (77%) of all new solar capacity installed this year has been developed in states that voted for president Trump – including eight of the top 10 states for new solar installations: Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas.

Solar module manufacturing

Elsewhere, the US added 13 GW of new solar module manufacturing capacity in the first half of 2025, with facilities opening or expanding in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. This brought total domestic module capacity to 55 GW. However, there was no new upstream manufacturing investment in Q2 2025, with federal policies threatening to stall manufacturing momentum, the SEIA noted.

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” added Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie.

Electrical bills are one example of where prices are climbing. These increases are not solely driven by inflation; they are also being fueled by the construction of massive data centers across the U.S.

Different states are responding to that reality in different ways, but some are looking for large tech companies to foot the bill for their own projects, the Associated Press reported.

What's happening?

Massive data centers built by tech corporations like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta are springing up across America.

Beyond traditional functions like providing websites for online shopping, this incredible explosion of computing power is being used for generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, which is many times more resource-intensive than an ordinary computer search.

The astronomical number of computer servers inside need an equally astronomical amount of electricity to run, putting the power demands of these facilities above those of entire cities such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, or New Orleans, according to AP News.

To provide this power, electrical utilities are building new infrastructure, including power lines and power plants. Meanwhile, the same power companies are making special deals with these tech companies to capture their business and ensure that data centers are built in their area of operation — deals that involve paying lower rates for power.

Why is the power use of data centers important?

Theoretically, new users on the power grid should cover the cost of the infrastructure needed to serve them. However, in practice, ordinary ratepayers are footing the bill.

Monitoring Analytics, an independent organization monitoring the mid-Atlantic grid, found that 70% of last year's increases were caused by increased demand from data centers, for example.

That means that everyday consumers — like you — are paying more because someone else is using more electricity. That's on top of all the extra pollution being generated.

This increase is ""something legislators have been hearing a lot about,"" according to Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens' Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group.

""It's something we've been hearing a lot about,"" she told AP News. ""More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I've ever seen before. There's a massive outcry.""

What's being done about rising utility rates?

For now, legislation that might keep this issue in check is still in the works in 16 states.

However, you can opt out of paying most of these fees by generating your own electricity with solar panels. You'll also lower the amount of heat-trapping pollution produced to power your home.

I will conclude where I started by proposing four basic elements of a U.S. energy policy to address climate change: An “all-of-the above” approach to energy sources.","In my previous piece I identified four facts I believe must be addressed for any energy policy and its associated narrative to be politically viable for the vast majority of the American public: (1) climate change is a relatively low priority for most Americans, (2) America is a center-right country, (3) it is becoming more polarized, and (4) the appetite to personally pay to address climate change is quite low. Here I will dig into this deeper, again based on data from an excellent paper “The Science vs. the Narrative vs. the Voters: Clarifying the Public Debate Around Energy and Climate” by Roger Pielke, Jr. and Ruy Teixeira of the American Enterprise institute(AEI), supplemented by more detailed data kindly provided by Dr. Teixeira. The paper is based on a survey of over 3,000 voters that was conducted for AEI by YouGov between September 20-26, 2024.

Using data from this survey and a variety of other sources I suggest four basic elements for a U.S. energy policy:

An “all-of-the above” approach to energy sources.

Energy choices should be based on economics, not ideology.

Cost and availability should determine the energy mix.

Getting the U.S. to net-zero as quickly as possible is a low priority.

I will provide data to support of each element, starting with the first one.

An “All-of-the-Above” Approach to Energy Sources

Respondents were given three choices for the supply element of an energy policy:

We need a rapid green industry transition to end the use of fossil fuels and replace them with fully renewable energy sources, regardless of the costs (22%).

We need an “all-of-the-above” strategy that provides abundant and cheap energy from multiple sources, including oil and gas, renewables, and advanced nuclear power (55%).

We need to stop the push to replace domestic oil and gas production with unproven green energy projects that raise costs and undercut jobs (23%).

The anti-fossil fuel and anti-renewables crowds are less than the “all-of-the-above-crowd.” An energy policy that ignores this will get traction depending on which party is in office but not beyond that. This is highly problematic since climate change is a forever issue and we need stable and long-term policies to deal with it, policies which can only be created in a bipartisan way.

While this may sound Pollyannish in our current polarized political environment, there is some encouraging data that suggests this is possible. Over 50% of voters across party affiliation and political ideology support the “all-of-the-above” approach. The numbers are 56%, 54%, and 53% for Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, respectively; they are 53%, 59%, and 51% for Liberals, Moderates, and Conservatives, respectively. Not surprisingly, Democrats (37%) and Liberals (42%) load heavy on “renewables only” and Republicans (40%) and Conservatives (43%) load heavily on “fossil fuels only,” and Independents and Moderates are in between.

MORE FOR YOU

This preference for an “all-of-the-above” strategy is supported by data from when respondents were asked about the goals for the future energy supply. Nearly three quarters (71%) preferred to “Use a mix of energy sources including oil, coal and natural gas along with renewable energy sources” vs. 29% who preferred to “Phase out the use of oil, coal and natural gas completely, relying instead on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power only.” There’s the usual skew with those expressing preference for a mix of sources being 52% for Democrats, 64% for Moderates, and 91% for Republicans; the numbers by ideology at 47% for Liberals, 71% for moderates, and 92% for conservatives.

As a practical matter, there will be a mix of energy sources for years to come. The U.S. Energy Information Administration produces periodic reports which include projections for energy sources until 2050. Here are the latest projections prepared after the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed and before much of it was rolled back in the One Big Beautiful Bill. Between 20005 and 2020 the main trend is the replacement of coal by natural gas. The latter is about half as carbon intensive per unit of energy produced although the exact amount depends up how much methane is leaked during production since it is about 80 times more potent than CO₂ over a 20-year period. U.S. production is much cleaner than the global average but lags the best performers of the Netherlands and Norway.

All of the four projections show an energy mix, as well as dramatic increases in solar and wind. Coal continues to decline. The big variability is the proportion of these two to natural gas. There are many variables which will determine this including government policies, relative prices, technological developments, and consumer preferences. Tradeoffs will be inevitable, such as price, availability, and reliability vs. amount of carbon emissions. The discussion we should be having in America is about the relative proportions and the tradeoffs involved in each. Those supporting a “renewables-only” future are dreaming, just as are those who only want to “Drill, Baby, Drill.” We need a narrative that is neither of these.

Energy Choices Should be Based on Economics, not Ideology

Opinion varies on what the total mix should be, as shown in Table 2 for energy preferences When combining first and second choices solar is most popular at 59%, natural gas (45%) and wind (43%) are about the same, followed by nuclear (27%) and coal (17%) at the bottom. More detailed data is provided in Table A1 “Voters’ Ranking of Energy Sources” in the report. The top two choices for Republicans and Conservatives are, in order, natural gas and nuclear. Solar ranks third, coal fourth and wind fifth. For Democrats, Independents, Liberals, and Moderates the rank order is solar, wind, natural gas, nuclear, and coal. These two groupings are essentially mirror images of each other. But it’s worth noting that solar and natural gas comprise the largest two sources of energy in all scenarios except for High Uptake and equally acceptable to each group with different preferences. This suggest a second element for U.S. energy policy which is to expand solar as much as is economically feasible, without taking actions to interfere with that, and to produce as much natural gas as is needed as cleanly as possible.

It is revealing to compare these stated preferences to what is actually happening on the ground despite the loud rhetoric on both sides. California leads the nation in solar production at 68,816 GWh in 2023 but followed by Texas at 31,739 GWh and Florida at 17,806 GWh. But whereas the growth rate from 2022 to 2023 was 9% for California, it was 25% and 28% for Texas and Florida, respectively. Others in the top 10 are the purple states of North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Virginia and the blue states of New York (ranked 8th) and Massachusetts (ranked 10th).

In terms of wind production, five of the top 10 states are red (Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and North Dakota) and five are blue (Illinois, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Minnesota). The top four are, in order, Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Texas dominates with 10,545 GWh. When solar and wind are combined for 2024, five of the top six are in Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Florida. Once again, Texas (with a population of about 32 million) dominates at 169,442 GWh, more than twice that of Number Two California (with a population of about 40 million) at 79,544 GWh. Whie it’s true that government policies can tip the scales on energy sources, over the long term economics, not ideology will prevail.

Cost and Availability Should Determine the Energy Mix

The question then becomes what consumers expect from an ‘all-of-the-above” policy for energy supply. When asked “What is most important to you about the energy you consume?” cost (37%) and availability (36%) are far more important than the effect on climate (19%) and the effect on U.S. energy security (6%). Democrats and Liberals rank the top three about the same at around 30%. Republicans and Conservatives rank the top two about the same at 40-45% but put climate change and energy security both at 5-8%. A third element of U.S. energy policy needs to be a focus on cost and availability.

Getting the U.S. to Net-Zero as Quickly as Possible is a Low Priority.

The fourth element of U.S. energy policy is the relative importance of different objectives for reducing the effects of climate change. Table 3 makes clear that a narrative grounded in getting the U.S. to net zero as quickly as possible is a complete non-starter. Less than one-third (29%) of voters think it is very important, and this is heavily driven by Democrats (48%) and Liberals (51%). It’s also worth noting that less than one-third of Independents (27%) and Moderates (29%) see this very important; only about in 10 Republicans and Conservatives see it this way. The top considerations are keeping costs low to consumers and increasing jobs and economic growth. Both are more important than net-zero for both Democrats (57%) and Liberals (56%). Low costs are especially important to Republicans (76%) and Conservatives (77%) suggesting that advocates for solar and wind should put more emphasis on lowering costs than reducing carbon emissions.

Increasing jobs and economic growth is the one item on which there is virtually no difference:

Democrats (58%); Liberals (56%)

Independents (54%); Moderates (60%)

Republicans (62%); Conservatives (62%)

This should be a major talking point for solar and wind. A related one is that efforts at the federal level to restrict solar and wind for ideological reasons will both increase costs and cut jobs. An analysis by Energy Innovation of the One Big Beautiful Bill found that over the next 10 years energy bills for all American households could increase by $170 billion (Texas and Florida are among the hardest hit states), we will lose 840,000 jobs by 2030 and another 790,000 by 2035, and added energy generating capacity will be less by 120 GW by 2030 and 330 GW by 2035. Those objecting to solar and wind for ideological reasons are working against their own self-interest.

More Democrats (61%) and Liberals (65%) think making sure proposals help lower-income communities is very important compared to Republicans (31%) and Conservatives (29%) with Independents (48%) and Moderates (45%) their usual in between. The reverse is true for limiting the burden of regulations on business. Just under half of Republicans and Conservatives feel this is very important compared to about one-fifth of Democrats and Liberals with Independents and Moderates roughly between the two. These results aren’t surprising to me.

What did surprise me is the small percentage of Republicans (34%) and Conservatives (33%) who think protecting the quality of the environment for future generations is important (Democrats are at 75% and Liberals are at 81%). I asked a conservative friend about this, and she wondered about the use of the word “protecting” and what this might connote for conservatives. One possibility is they see it as “protecting at all costs.” In a January 2024 survey (about which I’ll be writing a separate piece) of young rural conservatives commissioned by the American Conservation Coalition. Its “mission is to build the conservative environmental movement and it has 85,000 young conservative members across all 50 states with two of the most active ones being Texas and Florida. 40% said the environment should be protected even if it limits economic growth and 52% it should be but only if it doesn’t limit economic growth. There can obviously be tradeoffs here and people will have different relative preferences.

I will conclude where I started by proposing four basic elements of a U.S. energy policy to address climate change:

An “all-of-the above” approach to energy sources.

Energy choices should be based on economics, not ideology.

Cost and availability should determine the energy mix.

Getting the U.S. to net-zero as quickly as possible is a low priority.

I’m a “glass is half full guy” and think it is possible to create broad bipartisan support for such a policy. But it will take people with different political views to talk to each other than ignore or scream at each other.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68bd86d3d9c3cfa95a1a5e76/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-08 04:59:01.748422

Both candidates for governor have spoken about their concerns about energy costs.
New Jersey’s inability to control energy costs will undercut the many good programs intended to boost manufacturing in our state.","There’s been much discussion lately in New Jersey about bringing manufacturing companies to the state. It’s good that policymakers are paying attention and there are many laudable programs at the federal and state levels to boost manufacturing.

However, little mention is made about the cost of energy as perhaps to most expensive part of starting a manufacturing business New Jersey. It can be up to 50% of the cost of operations. Percentage shares of industrial energy consumption by the four major types of industries in the Annual Energy Outlook 2023 says it all as manufacturing dominates at 76% compared to mining at 12%, construction at 7% and agriculture at just 4%.

Can we ever lower NJ's skyrocketing energy costs?

We’ve seen energy costs in the state skyrocket this summer with little optimism that at even the current high cost, prices have stabilized. Unfortunately, this is a major impediment to jumpstarting a meaningful increase in manufacturing in New Jersey. Businesses looking at the many advantages to locating in New Jersey nonetheless will not overlook the operational risk of rising energy costs, thus limiting our potential here.

Making matters worse is the clamoring by some for a sole focus on renewables. The reality is at least for now it’s going to be extremely expensive given the recent elimination of subsidies for renewals as part of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" Act. Green advocates can continue to claim investing in green energy is affordable but the reality is the opposite and New Jersey businesses and residents are going to pay for the advocates adherence to their position.

That is why the Commerce and Industry Association of New Jersey has consistently expressed concerns about the state's rising energy costs, which we view as a negative factor for the business climate. The increase in costs is attributed to factors such as new electricity supply contracts, the state's clean energy policies and goals, and broader global energy price increases. CIANJ has also raised questions about the economic benefits and fairness of state subsidies for energy projects, suggesting that these subsidies may discourage future unsubsidized investment in the industry.

The primary reason energy prices are skyrocketing in New Jersey is because we do not produce enough energy in the state and are forced to buy on the PJM grid from nearby states with energy surpluses in what is now effectively a seller’s market. Simply put, we need to generate more of our own power to drive costs down and create more opportunities to bring new manufacturing to our state.

Energy costs are now a critical issue of this year’s campaign for governor between the Republican Jack Ciattarelli and the Democrat Mikie Sherrill, according to Seton Hall political science professor Matt Hale.

“Ciattarelli has a natural argument to say that this is all (Gov.) Murphy’s reliance on renewables and clean energy and wind — and none of that has actually happened,"" Hale recently told NJBiz.com

“If there were wind farms out there that were producing a massive amount of energy, as Murphy had hoped, that would have mitigated the rate cost,” said Hale. “I don’t think it would have gotten rid of them, but it would have mitigated the rate increases. I think that’s an easy way for Ciattarelli to say — she’s [Sherrill] going to continue this same far left approach, while you can’t afford to buy dinner.”

What do Ciattarelli, Sherrill say about rising NJ energy costs?

Both candidates for governor have spoken about their concerns about energy costs.

Ciattarelli has correctly said that natural gas must be a critical component in helping to expand New Jersey’s in-state capacity.

“I’ve never been an advocate for wind. I believe it’s bad economics, bad energy policy and bad environmental policy,” he has stated.

“Natural gas is a very rational bridge to the future — or whenever it is the future shows up. Whether that future is fusion energy, micro, modular nuclear, carbon capture, hydrogen cell — it will arrive. But until then, we need a rational transition to the future,” he has said.

Sherrill has said she would freeze rates on “day one” and also pledged to “massively increase” in-state power generation to bring down the cost of energy, including by supporting new solar and battery storage projects, expediting upgrades at existing nuclear plants, modernizing natural gas plants, and more.

However, Gov. Phil Murphy has questioned whether Sherrill can achieve this.

“I’m not sure how you’d actually do that,” Murphy said to reporters late last month. “These are private-sector players. I’m not sure if she got into the details as to how you do it, but we’ve been spending morning, noon and night on energy, energy sources, energy affordability for years.”

Businesses need certainty not just optimistic statements to invest for future growth. New Jersey’s inability to control energy costs will undercut the many good programs intended to boost manufacturing in our state. The next governor must ensure more power is generated in here. We cannot continue to be held hostage by other states that have a surplus of energy and can essentially dictate the price New Jersey businesses and residents ultimately are paying for it.

Conclusion: A Solar Sunrise Over India India's solar industry is at an inflection point.","India's solar industry is undergoing a seismic transformation, driven by a confluence of policy ambition, technological innovation, and geopolitical recalibration. As the world grapples with energy security and climate imperatives, India's push for self-reliance in solar manufacturing—coupled with its strategic response to U.S. tariffs—offers a compelling case study in supply chain resilience and clean energy leadership. For investors, this dynamic landscape presents both risks and opportunities, particularly as India repositions itself as a global manufacturing hub and a counterweight to China's dominance in the sector.

The Tariff Shock: A Catalyst for Reshoring

In August 2025, the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Indian solar goods, a move that has upended export dynamics for Indian manufacturers. Historically, the U.S. accounted for roughly one-third of India's solar module exports, with companies like ReNew Power and Vega Solar relying on American demand to scale production. The tariffs, combined with anti-dumping investigations, have forced a painful recalibration. However, this disruption has also accelerated India's pivot toward domestic demand and regional markets.

The U.S. policy shift mirrors a broader global trend of “reshoring” and “friend-shoring,” where nations are prioritizing energy security over cost efficiency. For India, this has meant doubling down on its Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) agenda. By March 2025, India's solar module manufacturing capacity had surged to 74 GW, up from 38 GW in March 2024, while solar cell capacity tripled to 25 GW. These figures underscore a strategic bet: India is no longer just a solar market but a solar manufacturing powerhouse.

Policy-Driven Resilience: From ALMM to PLI

India's self-reliance strategy is underpinned by a suite of policies designed to localize production and reduce import dependency. The Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) policy, reintroduced in April 2024, mandates that government-funded solar projects use only locally produced modules. This has spurred a wave of investments in domestic manufacturing, with the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme attracting over ₹41,000 crore in capital.

The PLI scheme's focus on high-efficiency technologies—such as TOPCon, HJT, and Perovskite-Silicon Tandem Cells—has elevated India's competitive edge. Companies like Rayzon Solar and Reliance Industries are now producing modules with efficiencies exceeding 23%, rivaling global benchmarks. Reliance's 20 GW solar manufacturing target by 2026, paired with its green hydrogen ambitions, exemplifies the sector's vertical integration drive.

Meanwhile, the Basic Customs Duty (BCD) of 25% on solar cells and 40% on modules has further insulated domestic producers from foreign competition. These measures, combined with the Domestic Content Requirement (DCR), are creating a closed-loop ecosystem where solar power producers must source components from approved local suppliers.

Diversifying the Supply Chain: Beyond China and the U.S.

India's solar industry has long relied on Chinese imports for polysilicon, ingots, and wafers—components that account for 80% of a module's cost. However, the U.S. tariffs and the “China Plus One” strategy have catalyzed a shift. By Q2 2025, India's solar cell and module imports from China had fallen by over a third compared to the previous year. Analysts predict that by 2030, India may import only raw polysilicon while producing all other components domestically.

This transition is not without hurdles. India lacks the infrastructure to mine and process critical minerals like silicon and lithium, and its coal-dependent grid raises the carbon intensity of upstream production. Yet, companies are innovating. Gujarat's first monocrystalline silicon ingot plant and Tamil Nadu's green energy-powered industrial parks signal a move toward localized, low-carbon manufacturing.

The Domestic Market: A Buffer Against Global Volatility

India's domestic demand for solar energy is a critical buffer against export headwinds. With nearly 170 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline and a 500 GW non-fossil fuel target by 2030, the country's appetite for solar is insatiable. The Prime Minister's Rooftop Solar Scheme 2025, which subsidizes residential installations, is further boosting decentralized power generation.

This domestic focus has already reshaped business models. Vega Solar, for instance, shifted from 90% exports to 90% domestic sales post-pandemic. Similarly, Reliance's solar manufacturing arm is prioritizing India's 1.3 billion population as its primary market. For investors, this shift reduces exposure to volatile international trade policies and positions India as a self-sustaining clean energy ecosystem.

Investment Implications: Navigating the Risks and Rewards

India's solar industry is a high-conviction play for investors seeking exposure to the energy transition. The sector's growth is underpinned by:

1. Policy Momentum: The PLI scheme, ALMM, and BCD create a favorable regulatory environment.

2. Cost Arbitrage: India's abundant sunlight and low labor costs make it a competitive manufacturing base.

3. Strategic Alliances: Partnerships with global innovators (e.g., Reliance's collaborations) are accelerating R&D.

However, risks persist. Upstream import dependency, energy costs, and geopolitical tensions (e.g., U.S.-China dynamics) could disrupt progress. Investors should prioritize companies with vertical integration, green hydrogen capabilities, and strong domestic market ties.

Conclusion: A Solar Sunrise Over India

India's solar industry is at an inflection point. The U.S. tariffs, while disruptive, have accelerated a transition that was inevitable: a shift from import dependence to self-reliance. By leveraging its domestic demand, policy tools, and strategic partnerships, India is not only securing its energy future but also positioning itself as a global clean energy leader. For investors, the key is to align with companies that are building end-to-end supply chains, embracing high-efficiency technologies, and capitalizing on the country's renewable energy boom.

In the long run, India's solar story is one of resilience and reinvention—a testament to the power of strategic reshoring in an era of energy uncertainty.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 05:59:31.625013

The event will bring together noted researchers from renowned universities worldwide. Unlike other conferences, submitting articles is not needed as the main focus will be on sharing knowledge and expertise.

The international scientific event will serve as a great opportunity for students, professors, and experts to benefit from the latest achievements and innovative ideas of the most distinguished researchers on clean energy.

The conference will be centered around key technological challenges such as hydrogen manufacturing as a future green fuel, new generation of energy storage devices, integrated photonic and catalytic energy storage, electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide, conventional and inverted solar cells, as well as examining the application of multi-metal chalcogenides in the energy sector.

The conference will be co-hosted by Prof. Malek Naderi, the director of the Graphene and Advanced Materials Laboratory (GAMLab) at Amirkabir University of Technology, and Prof. Mojtaba Abdi Jalebi, the director of the Functional Materials and Energy Device (FMED) Laboratory at University College London (UCL).

Clean energy ensures safer, better world for all

Alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, and reliable will contribute to addressing climate change, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and empowering vulnerable communities worldwide.

Provided by the sun, wind, water, waste, and heat from the Earth, renewable energy sources are abundant and emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.

They also benefit communities lacking access to reliable power sources. For populations without clean energy access, the lack of reliable power hinders education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.

Many of the developing regions still rely heavily on polluting fossil fuels for their daily life. If current trends continue, by 2030, around 1.8 billion people will still use unsafe, unhealthy, and inefficient cooking systems, such as burning wood.

The world needs to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by investing in clean energy, which is affordable and sustainable.

Hence, in 2023, the International Day of Clean Energy on January 26 was declared by the General Assembly as a call to raise awareness and mobilize action for a just and inclusive transition to clean energy for the benefit of people and the planet.

The day highlights the key role of clean energy in promoting sustainable development and mitigating climate change effects.

Leading renewable energy figures back North Sea,Not Available,,,,,https://www.agcc.co.uk/news-article/is-the-tide-turning-leading-clean-energy-figures-back-north-sea,"Two of Britain’s leading renewable energy figures have backed North Sea production as the cleanest way for the UK to get the oil and gas it requires.
“This isn’t about oil and gas or renewables; it’s about oil and gas and renewables,” he said.
This has led to an increase in LNG imports - which carry four-times higher emissions - from countries such as the US and Qatar, as the government compensates for declining production from the North Sea.
Mr Jackson told the Telegraph: “When we’re shipping LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world, it is a lot dirtier than using locally produced gas.
He said: “It’s encouraging to hear leading renewable energy voices recognising what industry has been saying for years – that the North Sea remains the UK’s cleanest and most secure source of oil and gas.","Two of Britain’s leading renewable energy figures have backed North Sea production as the cleanest way for the UK to get the oil and gas it requires.

Jurgen Maier, chairman of Great British Energy, said that “oil and gas is our foundation” and warned the basin is “haemorrhaging workers too fast and risks losing supply chains.” He urged closer collaboration between oil and gas and renewables to protect jobs.

“This isn’t about oil and gas or renewables; it’s about oil and gas and renewables,” he said. “We must create bridges to welcome companies and workers into the clean energy sector.”

Maier admitted to “feeling nervous” ahead of the Offshore Europe industry gathering last week, but said: “I know we are at a crossroads and understand the mood and anxiousness of the oil and gas community in Aberdeen.

""We can’t repeat [past transitions] here. And there is some good news, which is that this transition is lasting much longer, and unlike the transition from coal, this time there is an alternative; renewable energy.”

Meanwhile Greg Jackson, chief executive of Octopus Energy, said exploiting domestic reserves was cleaner than relying on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband banned the issuing of new drilling licences in British waters after Labour came to power last year. This has led to an increase in LNG imports - which carry four-times higher emissions - from countries such as the US and Qatar, as the government compensates for declining production from the North Sea.

Mr Jackson told the Telegraph: “When we’re shipping LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world, it is a lot dirtier than using locally produced gas.

“So if we’re going to produce gas then I’ve got no problem in using local stuff.”

Mr Jackson stated that North Sea drilling would, in his view, not bring down bills, but said it would lower emissions.

He added: “British gas producers won’t be selling it any cheaper than the global market. But it is cleaner and it reduces the backlash against climate policy. I’ve got no problem with it.”

Both leaders - Mr Maier through GB Energy and Mr Jackson through Octopus - have been strong advocates of renewables, but their interventions highlight a growing recognition that North Sea oil and gas must continue to play a role during the transition.

Russell Borthwick, Chief Executive at Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, welcomed the remarks.

He said: “It’s encouraging to hear leading renewable energy voices recognising what industry has been saying for years – that the North Sea remains the UK’s cleanest and most secure source of oil and gas.

""Aberdeen has the skills, innovation and determination to drive both the transition and our continued energy security – but we need government to match that ambition with supportive policy, starting with the removal of the Energy Profits Levy and a more nuanced approach to new activity.”",https://agcc.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/shutterstock_422654995.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 05:59:43.677394

""If Americans can be convinced of the real advantages of EVs, there's nowhere to go but up,"" EnergySage concluded.","With federal tax incentives for electric vehicles on the brink of their end date, a popular marketplace detailed myths about the clean automobiles. It noted that the United States is well behind other countries in adopting EVs.

In Norway, 90% of new vehicle sales are electric. That figure is 63% in Sweden and around 30% in the United Kingdom and China, EnergySage reported. The U.S. is at 9%.

""There's a stigma against EVs here that doesn't exist in other places, and a lot of it may stem from fossil fuel propaganda,"" the site stated. It added: ""It's time to debunk these myths once and for all.""

Big Oil, of course, has much to lose if EVs win. EnergySage noted lobbyists spent $7 million in 2021 just to work against a proposal to limit vehicle pollution from new cars, which was not set to begin until 2027.

EnergySage interviewed a trio of automobile industry experts, including Jonny Lieberman, who hosts Driving with Jonny (@drivingwithjonny). He cited people who have no interest in EVs and fear problems, such as fires, in saying, ""Every time one of those is brought up, it just strikes me as propaganda by Chevron, Shell, or the petroleum industry.""

Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield, who created Transport Evolved (@transportevolved), called it a ""perfect storm of political misinformation and fossil fuel lobbying — lobbyists in America are very, very powerful.""

To counter four myths, the independent clean energy platform laid out how EVs are not much more expensive than gas-powered cars. It noted that states, municipalities, utilities, and manufacturers also offer incentives similar to the federal tax credits — $7,500 for a new EV and $4,000 for a used one — that will expire Sept. 30. Home charging and the absence of regular maintenance needs help EV drivers break even after a few years, Gordon-Bloomfield said.

Range anxiety is also mostly a thing of the past, as today's EVs can travel 300-400 miles on one charge. The average American drives 29 miles in one day, according to the Department of Transportation. And ""even in the absolute worst conditions,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said, the charging time to reach 80% battery maxes out at 90 minutes.

EVs are far less prone to catch fire than their counterparts, with 25 blazes per 100,000 EVs sold. The rate is over 60 times higher for gas-powered vehicles, at 1,530 per 100,000. Batteries also last for 10-12 years, State of Charge (@StateOfChargeWithTomMoloughney) host Tom Moloughney told EnergySage, and they can be 80-90% efficient. Internal combustion engines are 20% efficient, with the remaining 80% of dirty energy use producing waste heat and noise, per Lieberman.

Finally, the EV industry is suffering from a crisis of confidence, per the experts. Despite their instant torque, high-tech features, and quiet cabins, electric vehicles are not as trendy as gas-powered vehicles in the eyes of consumers.

""In other countries, cars are sold very differently. In America, cars are very often seen as a status symbol, they're seen as an extension of the self,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said. ""We're buying more on image than we are on actual substance.""

In fact, EVs are converting drivers from India to France to the U.S. And almost all of them say they will never go back.

There is a huge variation of energy access for people in these situations worldwide.
So, decarbonizing energy supply is a very important part of addressing climate change.
Because most forcibly displaced people are in countries that are highly vulnerable to climate change .
This interconnectedness is also the reason the new Humanitarian Energy and Climate Transitions portfolio at SEI Oxford covers both energy and climate.","On the one hand, it’s simple. Humanitarian energy refers to all the electricity, fuel, and energy technologies needed to provide power and supply cooking in refugee camps and for forcibly displaced people.

On the other hand, it’s complex . “Forcibly displaced people ” covers a number of different groups, including refugees, internally displaced people, asylum seekers, and forced migrants who have been displaced due to persecution, conflict, generalized violence, human rights violations, or the adverse effects of climate change and environmental degradation. Worldwide there are now over 120 million forcibly displaced people . But if we add in those experiencing humanitarian crises such as natural disasters this figure rises to 305 million people . There is a huge variation of energy access for people in these situations worldwide.

Further complicating the picture is climate change. Globally, the energy sector produces the most greenhouse gas emissions by far, over 70% . So, decarbonizing energy supply is a very important part of addressing climate change. This is particularly true in the humanitarian sector. Why? Because most forcibly displaced people are in countries that are highly vulnerable to climate change . This interconnectedness is also the reason the new Humanitarian Energy and Climate Transitions portfolio at SEI Oxford covers both energy and climate. We can see that understanding how both issues come together is critical to informing policy and practice choices on reducing emissions.

As one of the interviewees for my book, “Voices in the Dark ”, said about energy: “It is underpinning everything. If you have no battery, you have no torch. If you have no panel, you have no phone charging business. If you have no diesel, you have no lights or fan. If you have no wood, you have no food”. Modern life requires energy. Could you email or use your phone without electricity, cook food without an oven or cooking appliance, or light your home in the evenings, without energy?

The same is true for refugees and displaced people: life without energy is severely limited. It is a myth that refugees and displaced people don’t need energy – over two-thirds of refugees are mobile phone users, and of course everyone needs heat to cook food and boil water.

My view is that energy access should be a human right. This might not sound like a controversial opinion, but to some it is! Some humanitarians think of energy for refugees and displaced people as a secondary concern or a luxury. As an issue, energy has been overlooked by the humanitarian community. For example, energy has long been treated as a sub-topic within water provision (electricity for water pumping) or human rights (providing basic cookstoves for women to reduce the risk of gender-based violence). While these are important matters, this tendency to treat energy as not as important as other issues means that many other household and business energy needs are forgotten or neglected.

Now, finally, energy is receiving attention within the UN. This is thanks to a confluence of factors – the work of key advocates and refugees themselves , growing recognition that emissions from humanitarian operations must be addressed as part of efforts to stem greenhouse gas emissions, and technological progress that shows how new innovations in renewable energy can help. For example, I was part of a team of researchers who contributed to a recent UN Environment Programme report that examined how new solar cookers and other innovations can help improve the situation in humanitarian settings and in “last-mile”, underserved communities.

Things vary widely: for example, in Kenya and Rwanda in East Africa people rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking, and many families use candles, torches, or mobile phones for lighting. While refugees living in towns in Jordan buy fuel and gas canisters and pay for electricity from the Jordian national grid.

Electricity access is not only limited; it’s expensive. Refugees often pay high prices to charge phones or use internet shops. And in places like Gaza that are under active siege, access to basic energy services can be almost impossible to come by.

What needs to change? Displaced people need better access to more energy. Some 94% of forcibly displaced people living in camps are estimated to not have meaningful access to power. An estimated 81% lack anything other than the most basic fuels for cooking.

The sources of energy used also need to shift radically – away from diesel for generators and firewood and liquefied petroleum gas or firewood for cooking.

And things need to speed up. Consider this: more than 11,000 diesel generators are still in use by humanitarian operations, costing more than $100 million to be spent on polluting fossil fuel and emitting almost 200,000 tonnes of CO2. The humanitarian sector has been remarkably slow to switch to renewable technologies.

The systems for supplying energy within the UN are underfunded and often inefficient. Meanwhile the private sector and energy businesses find it challenging to commercially engage because humanitarian systems can be opaque and often do not support long-term investments.

For money to start flowing, change is needed for public- and private-sector sources.

For public funding, UN system reform is essential. Within the UN humanitarian system, energy gets left behind as a “secondary need”, meaning funding is spent elsewhere. UN procurement rules tightly control which suppliers can provide energy products and services. This can exclude renewable energy companies from applying for tenders. To establish new rules and ways of working requires support from donors and the UN to change some of the ways they implement energy programmes currently – by switching to using renewable technologies instead of fossil fuel powered ones ..

For private-sector financing, the problems are different. Refugee camps are seen as risky places to invest because refugees might move and not be able to repay loans. However, refugees actually have one of the highest repayment rates: the micro-lending organization Kiva suggests that over 96% of their loans have been repaid in full. Despite this, many private-sector organizations have little experience investing in displacement settings, and they are cautious. Some organizations, such as Ashden and Acumen , have started testing commercially viable sustainable energy projects with refugee entrepreneurs. But more research will be needed to understand how these investments can be scaled. For this reason, financing and investment are a first, core topic on SEI Oxford’s research agenda .

As a start, we hope the work will lead to more awareness and greater understanding of the humanitarian system among decision-makers who are essential players in setting the stage for meaningful change.

We hope the work can led to positive changes in the ways donors and investors spend money on energy and climate solutions in humanitarian settings. New research on innovative financial practices can enable more funding and financing which directly supports renewable solutions, and higher levels of energy access, for forcibly displaced people.

And overall, we hope our work can shed light on how joining together renewable energy and climate action objectives can improve the health, well-being, and quality of life of all displaced people and all those in so-called “last-mile communities” that have been left behind in the clean energy transition.",https://www.sei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gettyimages-200564794-001-1374x916.webp?modtime=,N,,2025-09-08 05:59:47.013771

From electric vehicles to high-efficiency HVAC upgrades, these incentives have played a major role in supporting the transition to more sustainable technology.

But as of September 2025, things are about to change quickly.

With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), many of the most popular clean energy tax credits are now facing hard expiration dates. If your business or household is considering an energy-efficient purchase or upgrade, the next four months may be your final opportunity to benefit from key incentives.

EV Credits Expiring After September 30, 2025

The most urgent deadlines relate to electric and hybrid vehicles. The following credits will terminate for purchases made after September 30, 2025:

Section 30D: The Clean Vehicle Credit for new electric vehicles, previously offering up to $7,500

Section 25E: The Credit for Previously Owned Clean Vehicles, worth up to $4,000

Section 45W: The Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit for business fleet purchases

Section 6426(k): The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Credit

If you are planning to purchase or lease an EV, either personally or for your business, the vehicle must be acquired on or before September 30, 2025 to qualify for any of these credits.

Other Energy Credits Set to Expire by Year-End or in 2026

Several other energy efficiency incentives are also set to expire soon. Here is a breakdown of the most widely used credits and their deadlines:

Section 25C: Energy-Efficient Home Improvement Credit

Expires for improvements made after December 31, 2025

Section 25D: Residential Clean Energy Credit (solar, wind, geothermal)

Ends for expenditures made after December 31, 2025

Section 179D: Deduction for Energy-Efficient Commercial Buildings

“We will conduct the tender process openly and transparently,” he emphasized.

Rosan recently visited China to meet with Jiaxing Jiayuan SUS Environment, one of the world’s leading WtE operators. The company is known for its advanced combustion technology that generates renewable electricity while promoting sustainable waste management.

“We discussed potential cooperation in Indonesia that could support national targets for green energy development, while also exploring their manufacturing capacity and technological innovation,” Rosan wrote on his Instagram account.

In late July 2025, Rosan also met with Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati to discuss Danantara’s 33 strategic projects, with a focus on five priority projects in selected cities. The talks highlighted concrete steps to accelerate public investment, including financing strategies through potential Danantara bond issuance.

Sri Mulyani noted that the initial projects were chosen based on readiness and strong socio-economic impact.

“These initial projects were selected to ensure that every rupiah invested creates added value for both regional and national development,” she wrote on Instagram, quoted Thursday, September 4, 2025.

She also underlined the importance of maintaining project sustainability at the regional level and ensuring transparent communication with the public, markets, and institutions.

The meeting underscored a joint commitment between the Finance Ministry and Danantara to design a more targeted, measurable, and coordinated investment plan.

“The expectation is that these projects will not only stimulate economic growth but also deliver tangible benefits to the people,” she added.",https://cdn.indonesiabusinesspost.com/3/4/9/9/danantara_300x206.png,N,,2025-09-08 06:00:26.540475

By prioritizing fossil fuels, imposing tariffs on solar imports, and rolling back environmental regulations, the administration introduced policy uncertainty that reshaped market dynamics and investor behavior. As the U.S. energy sector transitions toward decarbonization, understanding these long-term risks is critical for stakeholders navigating an evolving regulatory and economic environment.

Policy Uncertainty and Solar Investment

The Trump administration’s 2018 imposition of a 30% tariff on imported solar panels—gradually decreasing to 18% by 2022—significantly raised project costs, leading to the cancellation or delay of over $20 billion in solar investments and the loss of more than 62,000 jobs [3]. While the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) remained in place, its phased reduction from 30% to 26% by 2020 under Trump’s tenure created a vacuum in federal support for clean energy [1]. This contrasted sharply with the Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which expanded the ITC and provided a clearer policy framework for investors [1].

The administration’s broader protectionist trade policies, including tariffs on steel and aluminum, further compounded costs for solar infrastructure [4]. These measures, justified as efforts to protect domestic manufacturing, instead stifled the solar industry’s growth during a period of declining global technology costs. According to a report by BloombergNEF, U.S. renewable energy investment fell by $20.5 billion in the second half of 2024, reflecting investor recalibration amid Trump-era policy headwinds [1].

Grid Reliability and Regulatory Fragmentation

While the Trump administration rolled back over 100 environmental regulations—including the Clean Power Plan—it also introduced pro-renewable FERC orders, such as Order 841 (2018) and Order 2222 (2020), which aimed to integrate distributed energy resources into wholesale markets [4]. However, the administration’s simultaneous deregulation of fossil fuels and withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in 2020 created conflicting signals for grid planning [6].

Grid reliability now faces dual challenges: aging infrastructure and insufficient investment in transmission expansion. The U.S. grid, with over 600,000 miles of aging transmission lines, requires a two- to fivefold expansion to accommodate renewable energy from remote locations [3]. Trump’s “beneficiary pays” cost recovery model and slow permitting processes for transmission projects have exacerbated these challenges, creating regulatory fragmentation that hinders progress [3]. For instance, the cancellation of the Revolution Wind project under Trump’s 2025 executive orders has raised concerns about increased blackout risks and delayed decarbonization goals [1].

Investor Confidence and Capital Flow Trends

Clean energy investors have experienced heightened volatility since 2020, with climate-themed equities showing mixed performance. From 2020 to 2023, clean energy stocks averaged declines of –11% and –10.5%, driven by rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions, and policy uncertainty [1]. While diversified climate transition funds outperformed pure-play renewables, the sector’s sensitivity to macroeconomic factors remains pronounced [1].

Academic research highlights a “greenium” effect, where investors accept lower returns for green stocks due to hedging benefits against climate transition risks [1]. However, Trump’s rhetoric—criticizing renewables as inflationary and blocking state-level EV mandates—has further muddied the waters [2]. Legal and regulatory risks, including investor-state disputes over revoked projects, add another layer of complexity [4].

Strategic Risks for Investors

The long-term risks for clean energy investors include:

1. Regulatory Whiplash: Frequent policy reversals between administrations create uncertainty, deterring long-term capital commitments.

2. Grid Modernization Delays: Without robust transmission infrastructure, renewable projects face interconnection bottlenecks, reducing their economic viability.

3. Global Competitiveness: Trump’s cuts to R&D funding for solar and wind technologies weakened the U.S. position in the global clean energy race [5].

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act has injected $369 billion into clean energy, but overcoming Trump’s legacy of deregulation and fragmented permitting will require sustained political will [4]. For investors, sectoral diversification, geographic focus, and active stock selection remain key strategies to mitigate these risks [1].

Conclusion

Trump’s energy policies have left a legacy of market disruption and regulatory ambiguity, complicating the path to a reliable, low-carbon grid. While state-level initiatives and global momentum for renewables offer some resilience, federal policy inconsistency remains a critical barrier. Investors must weigh these strategic risks against the growing demand for clean energy, recognizing that grid modernization and policy stability will be pivotal in determining long-term returns.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 04:58:47.588080

US workers can kiss another 1,000 factory jobs good-bye, now that the “salt battery” firm Natron has closed its doors. The closure is also a setback for renewable energy stakeholders, who were counting on a new generation of low-cost batteries for wind and solar storage. However, it’s not the end of the line for sodium batteries. Another US energy storage startup, Inlyte, is still on track to begin domestic production of it new sodium-iron battery formula.

Lights Out For The Natron Sodium Battery …

It seems like only yesterday that Natron was gearing up to produce its sodium batteries at a former lithium-ion battery facility in North Carolina. As of last year, Natron was prepping the site for an initial capacity of 600 megawatts, leading up to the gigascale buildout of additional factories in the future.

As of earlier this week, though, the hammer came down. Natron announced that it is winding down operations at its Michigan headquarters as well as the North Carolina shop.

The company did not provide a detailed explanation, but lurking in the background of every factory closure these days is US President Donald Trump and his misbegotten tariff wars, along with his persistent attacks on the domestic wind and solar industries.

Trump’s allies in Congress can also take a bow for destroying good-paying factory jobs all over the US. With Republicans in control of both the House and Senate, the President’s demand for a job-crushing tax bill — the “One Big Beautiful Bill” — sailed through Congress in July.

“The OBBB was enthusiastically supported by every Republican member of Congress from North Carolina, including so-called senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, and representatives Greg Murphy, Virginia Foxx, Addison McDowell, David Rouzer, Mark Harris, Richard Hudson, Pat Harrigan, Chuck Edwards, Brad Knott, and Tim Moore,” CleanTechnica’s Steve Hanley noted last week.

… Lights On For Sodium Energy Storage

So much for those 1,000 new jobs. Nevertheless, as President Trump surely knows, the renewable energy transition is unstoppable. Real estate investors and developers are continuing to fill the demand for onsite renewable energy, particularly solar energy, and they are fueling the demand for more, better, cheaper energy storage technologies, too.

Sodium emerged as a significant area of energy storage research about 50 years ago, but lithium-ion technology leaped ahead on the basis of superior energy density, durability, and other key parameters. Still, sodium offers the advantages of an abundant, non-toxic, non-flammable, and relatively inexpensive supply chain.

In addition, sodium offers the potential for long-duration energy storage at the grid-scale level, which the US Department of Energy (such as it is today) defines as at least 10 hours, ideally much longer. In contrast, the typical lithium-ion battery array only lasts around 4 hours or so.

Researchers have been chipping away at the limitations of sodium technology over the past 50 years, and that brings us to Inlyte today (see more sodium battery background here).

The Inlyte Solution

Inlyte surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar in March of this year when it announced plans for accelerating its manufacturing timeline in the US, in partnership with the Swiss sodium battery specialist HORIEN Salt Battery Solutions (formerly FZSoNick). Following the success of a pilot-scale plant in the UK, the new “Inlyte Factory 1” in the US will integrate Inlyte’s sodium-iron formula into HORIEN’s manufacturing system.

In June, Inlyte also managed to squeeze a $4 million grant out of the Energy Department, through the agency’s CiFER (Critical Facility Energy Resilience) program.

“Inlyte and its partners will develop and demonstrate an iron and sodium long duration energy storage system to improve energy resilience at the Alliance Redwoods site in Occidental, CA,” the Energy Department somewhat cryptically explained in a press statement.

Inlyte provided more details in a press statement of its own. Alliance Redwoods is a nonprofit organization and retreat destination for church groups and other nonprofits. It was selected for the sodium-iron battery demonstration partly due to its designation as an evacuation center and fire protection staging area in a high-risk area for wildfires, where both diesel fuel and lithium-ion energy storage technology are at a disadvantage.

“The project, developed with partner Vital Energy Solutions, will enhance wildfire resilience for a critical evacuation zone, reduce facility electricity costs, and provide a diesel-free alternative for long-duration backup power,” Inlyte explained. “Inlyte’s domestically manufactured, non-flammable battery solution is uniquely suited for this project, maintaining performance at high ambient temperatures.”

The plan is to integrate the 200-kilowatt, 4 megawatt-hour, sodium-iron energy storage system in a microgrid featuring a 570-kilowatt solar array. Despite the relatively small size of the overall system, Alliance is expecting a big payoff. Inlyte estimates that the organization could shave as much as $300,000 off its annual electricity bill once the microgrid is up and running in 2027.

In addition, the new system will provide a good two weeks worth of backup power in emergencies, enabling Redwoods to ditch the cost of maintaining a diesel backup generator. In case of an emergency, the extra added benefit of noise-free, pollution-free power generation will make life easier for first responders and evacuees at the site, too.

“The project will also provide backup power for Russian River Utility’s nearby water pump station, which is essential for public water supply and firefighting efforts,” Inlyte added.

Everybody Wants More & Better Energy Storage

A member of the Alliance board, Mike Dethlefsen, neatly summed up the case for on-site renewable energy and energy storage. “With Inlyte’s battery and our solar array, we can operate independently from the grid during outages at a greatly reduced cost,” he said. “Crucially, it ensures we can remain operational to serve our community and power other critical local infrastructure when the grid goes down.”

Those same factors can apply to any number of community assets and commercial properties. Inlyte already anticipates replicating the Alliance model elsewhere.

In the latest news from Inlyte, on September 5, the company announced that former Tesla manufacturing director Alison Armstrong is joining its executive team, along with Sandor Hollo (former CTO of GE Energy Storage) and Dilip Goswami, (former CEO of Molekule and venture partner at At One Ventures).

“The new leadership appointments mark a pivotal moment for Inlyte Energy as it transitions from technology development to commercial-scale production,” Inlyte explained.

As part of that transition, Inlyte has partnered with the leading utility Southern Company on a utility-scale version of its energy storage technology, to be demonstrated at a location in Birmingham, Alabama. Installation is expected before the end of the year.

Inlyte expects an evaluation period of at least one year to follow. “Results will be shared across a broad utility network, in collaboration with EPRI,” the company added, referring to the independent, influential nonprofit organization Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).

EPRI launched in 1972, and it has been on a decarbonization tear of late. With a seal of approval from EPRI under its belt, Inlyte could be poised to make the most of an opportunity that slipped through the fingers of Natron.

Gone from Washington for about a month, a window that has generated a swollen backlog of pressing national work, lawmakers filled their days with public meetings with constituents, bill introductions, town-hall meetings and foreign travel.

Pallone and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) met in Perth Amboy with the president of Planned Parenthood’s national organization about how cuts brought on by the new law will affect abortion access in states like New Jersey, where abortion is legal under state law. The law will reduce access for “tens of thousands” of patients in the state, Pallone predicted. “It blocks people from getting birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing just because of where they go for care,” he said, alluding to how the law blocks Planned Parenthood patients from more than abortion services.

Campaigning, traveling

The Democratic nominee for governor, Sherrill spent the recess campaigning, criticizing her Republican rival Jack Ciattarelli and gathering endorsements.

While Sherrill was traveling in-state, Pallone and Sen. Andy Kim, New Jersey’s junior senator, went to Asia on congressionally organized trips.

Tasked with responsibilities to NATO, the transatlantic military alliance, Rep. Donald Norcross (D-1st) went to Britain, he said by email.

“As a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I spent some time abroad, including in the United Kingdom, meeting with our allies to ensure our relationships with them remain strong,” Norcross said.

Beyond constituent meetings and town halls — Norcross said he’s hosted 111 during his time in Congress since 2014 — he also took it easier after his health scare this year from sepsis. “I also spent some time with my family, which was much-needed after my near-death experience earlier this year.”

Reps. Herb Conaway (D-3rd) and Nellie Pou (D-9th) were in Israel from Aug. 6 to 14 paid for by the American Israel Education Foundation, a group linked with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential pro-Israel lobby.

“This trip allowed me to learn more about the horrific events of October 7th and the State of Israel’s and Gaza conflict that has been all over the news,” Pou wrote in a mandated disclosure about the trip for a congressional ethics committee. “Some of the meetings and events that I attended were seminars regarding Oct 7 hostages, meeting with families of these hostages, learning about humanitarian aid as well as being briefed on the events in Gaza, meeting with Israeli officials and many more briefings about the conflicts in the middle east [sic].”

Over the break, Pou was involved in 20 public events, spokesman Mark Greenbaum said, including parades in Paterson and Passaic, visits to senior centers and community centers and a visit to the pipe rupture in Paterson, where a series of water pipes broke this August.

Different views of Medicaid cuts

Conaway “did go to Israel where he heard directly from Israelis, Arab Israelis, Palestinians, and peace activists. He spoke about meaningful, long-term solutions that could one day bring this conflict to an end,” his spokesman Chris Garcia said by email.

Garcia said Conaway held a town hall in Hamilton, where the Israel trip came up. Like many other Democrats nationwide, Conaway, a medical doctor, held a “roundtable” meeting about Medicaid cuts and how they will affect New Jersey, Garcia said.

Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) went to Israel on a separate trip, with Republicans and Democrats from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd), who has insisted cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the nation’s largest food-aid network, will not affect those in need, held one virtual town hall to which residents called in, said spokeswoman Paxton Antonucci, adding that Van Drew stayed in South Jersey during the congressional break.

“He was everywhere from county fairs to national and community nights out to church festivals, firehouse cookouts, and backyard barbecues,” Antonucci said in an emailed statement. “He also visited senior centers, toured small businesses, met with constituents, and fielded questions from local business, labor, and community leaders from every corner of our district — which is actually larger geographically than the entire state of Delaware.”

Spokespeople for Kean and Reps. Chris Smith (R-4th) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12th) did not respond to requests for comment about their recess activities.

Escaping ‘craziness’ of Washington

“It’s always great to be in-district,” Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “Especially when we have so much craziness going on in Washington, D.C.”

“We had our back-to-school family resource fair, which was wonderful,” McIver said. Her office also hosted a public meeting on school lunch access, she said.

McIver’s office and the office of Rep. Rob Menendez (D-8th) also held joint meetings in Jersey City and Newark to discuss the impact of the budget law and “the work they are doing to stand up to the Trump administration’s escalating attacks on democracy,” said McIver spokeswoman Hanna Rumsey.

Republicans have the votes to pass a spending bill out of the House on their own. But they will need seven Democrats minimum in the Senate to clear that chamber.

With Congress out of town, President Donald Trump ordered National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., saying he was doing so to bring peace to the city, where crime is at a 30-year low, and warning he may send troops into other large U.S. cities. These troops are a common sight around the city, in particular at subway stations and transit hubs like Union Station.

Also in August, the White House fired the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moved to restrict access to COVID-19 vaccines. The Environmental Protection Agency announced it wants to rescind a 2009 policy known as the “endangerment finding” that gives the agency the legal authority to regulate the gases that are warming Earth to a dangerous degree. Trump flirted with firing the head of the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, a move economic experts say would unravel global financial markets. Trump welcomed Russian dictator Vladimir Putin to American soil, meeting him on the tarmac of an airport in Alaska. And Trump tried to cancel about $5 billion in foreign aid — money Congress had already greenlit — in what a federal judge ruled last week was illegal.

Epstein, new rules

With recess over, tension continues to percolate within Republican ranks in Congress about how to handle the Epstein files — an issue that has hounded the GOP for months.

Back on Capitol Hill, members have taken up the annual defense policy bill required to authorize the Pentagon, and Republicans in the Senate are drawing up plans to rewrite procedure for that chamber, allowing them to confirm nominees to federal positions in bunches, rather than one by one.

But their central task is to fund the federal government, which could run out of money to fund its day-to-day operations at the end of the month.

Neither the House nor the Senate is close to finishing their drafts of the annual spending bill to fund the government, and with Congress scheduled to be gone for its Rosh Hashanah break in late September, members will almost certainly pass a short-term bill to fund the government before attempting to pass something more substantial this fall or winter.

Republicans have the votes to pass a spending bill out of the House on their own. But they will need seven Democrats minimum in the Senate to clear that chamber.

“If Republicans want to keep the government open, they have to work with Democrats in a bipartisan way. That’s the only way to get it done,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ leader, said. “Time is short.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota criticized “Democrat obstruction” over Trump’s nominees, saying that was gumming up the funding talks.

“I hope,” Thune said, “that our Democrat colleagues will resist the calls from within for a shutdown and work with us to fund the government.”

As it often does, the Senate, where Thune sets the agenda, adjourned around 4 p.m. Thursday until Monday afternoon.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/09/National-Guard-National-Mall-US-Capitol.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 01:58:53.899385

Chris Wright, after hosting Trump at his Montana mansion, was tapped as Energy Secretary.","Oil billionaire Harold Hamm was spotted celebrating with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the 2024 election results rolled in, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal.

Harold is the founder of Continental Resources, and he pumped millions into Trump’s campaign, along with many other energy executives.

Their goal was simply to kill the momentum behind clean energy, make drilling easier, and lock in fossil fuels as the core of U.S. energy policy. Within months of Trump returning to the White House, that investment was already being repaid.

Trump’s administration quickly moved to open up federal land and offshore waters for drilling. He authorized new natural gas export terminals and gutted several regulations, including the Obama-era EPA rule that allowed the government to regulate emissions from vehicles, power plants, and oil-and-gas operations.

His “One Big Beautiful Bill” wiped out tax credits for EVs and added tax cuts for fossil fuel companies. The new law is expected to stall renewable energy projects and make it harder for clean energy to compete.

Executives drive policy from inside the room

Of course the top energy executives got seats at the table. Harold, Energy Transfer Executive Chairman Kelcy Warren, and then-Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright helped raise millions for Trump’s campaign.

After the election, Warren gave $12.5 million more to MAGA Inc. His company also received a key permit extension for the Lake Charles LNG terminal, something the Biden administration had blocked.

Chris Wright, after hosting Trump at his Montana mansion, was tapped as Energy Secretary. Harold personally introduced Wright to Trump during a Mar-a-Lago roundtable. Wright wasn’t the only executive who got a new job.

At least a dozen former oil lobbyists and company heads are now scattered across federal agencies, including the Interior Department and Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council. The council’s mission is to speed up fossil fuel production, with the help of people who’ve spent decades in the industry.

The American Petroleum Institute, which couldn’t even schedule a meeting with the previous administration, is now back in daily contact. Mike Sommers, API’s chief, said, “We outlined a clear policy road map well before the last election, and they’ve advanced those issues at every turn.”

Trump met personally with API leaders in March. He told them oil and gas was his favorite industry. That same month, global tariffs were announced, but oil and gas products were excluded.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods, former Hess Corporation CEO John Hess, and Harold have all spoken directly to Trump by phone since the election. Many executives have Chris Wright’s number saved.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin have also met with energy executives multiple times since January.

Lower profits, more influence

The gains in access haven’t led to gains in profits. Oil is stuck around $62 a barrel, well below the $76 level it hit when Trump first entered office in 2017. That’s beneath the break-even point for many producers.

New tariffs on steel and aluminum, which Trump doubled in June, are raising drilling costs. Diamondback Energy says well construction costs are expected to jump by 25% this year. The company told investors that nearly every new well will be more expensive in 2025.

The financial pain is real. ConocoPhillips is cutting up to 25% of its workforce after its acquisition of Marathon Oil. Chevron is trimming 20% of its staff. Overall oil-and-gas extraction jobs dropped more than 3% from January through August, hitting a two-year low.

Still, many companies see this as a short-term cost for a long-term gain. Devon Energy, ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, and Occidental Petroleum told investors they expect to save over $1.2 billion next year because of new tax breaks. BP, which also operates in the U.S., said those savings will offset the extra cost of tariffs.

At a Trump fundraiser in Midland, Texas, the president repeated his campaign line: “Drill, baby, drill.” Curtis Leonard, one of the executives in the crowd, recalled someone shouting back, “We decide if we drill, not the government.” Still, most companies are playing along.

Taylor Sell, CEO of Element Petroleum, summed it up: “We all voted for this.”

In April, Wright, Burgum, Zeldin, and Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins gathered in Oklahoma City to talk about how the industry can meet rising energy demand from artificial intelligence.

The meeting, arranged by Harold, had so many high-level officials that attendees apparently joked about how many showed up without being invited together.

The latest US Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie warns that these policies could cut 44 GW of US solar growth by 2030 – an 18% decline.
Compared with pre-HR1 forecasts, that’s a total loss of 55 GW, or 21% fewer solar projects by 2030.
“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie.
“The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1.","The US solar industry put nearly 18 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity on the grid in the first half of 2025. Even as the Trump administration rolled out anti-clean energy policies, solar and storage still made up 82% of all new power added to the grid in the first six months of the year. But the growth picture isn’t as sunny as it looks, according to the SEIA.

Trump’s big bill (HR1) and new administration actions targeting solar have dragged down deployment forecasts. The latest US Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie warns that these policies could cut 44 GW of US solar growth by 2030 – an 18% decline. Compared with pre-HR1 forecasts, that’s a total loss of 55 GW, or 21% fewer solar projects by 2030.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. She added that the administration is “deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid.” Still, Hopper stressed that demand will keep the industry growing because “the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.”

Ironically, the report found that this year, 77% of new solar capacity has been built in states Trump won. Eight of the top 10 states for new installations — Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas — all went red in 2024.

On the manufacturing side, the US added 13 GW of new solar module capacity in the first half of the year, with factories ramping up in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. That brings total domestic capacity to 55 GW. But momentum stalled in Q2, with no new upstream manufacturing investment as federal policy uncertainty spooked private capital.

Looking ahead, SEIA and Wood Mackenzie expect solar deployment to land 4% lower than pre-HR1 projections by 2030. Near-term solar growth is buoyed by projects already underway, developers racing against tax credit deadlines, and surging electricity demand as new gas generation becomes pricier and less reliable.

The report also highlights the risk of federal permitting changes. A Department of the Interior order throws up obstructions for solar permits, threatening about 44 GW of planned projects. Arizona, California, and Nevada are expected to be hit hardest.

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie. “The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1. Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment incredibly challenging.”

SEIA has urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course, warning that the administration’s approach could mean lost jobs, higher power bills, and a weaker US economy.

The stakes stretch beyond energy: SEIA notes that if solar growth stalls as projected, the Trump administration will blow its chances at winning the global AI race – something it’s keen to do. Last week, the trade group rolled out a grid reliability policy agenda calling on leaders at all levels of government to shore up the grid with solar and storage to meet surging demand.

For those seeking alpha in 2025, the path lies in underappreciated industrial stocks and traditional automakers poised to thrive in a deregulated, energy-intensive future.","The 2025 Trump administration's sweeping rollback of emissions regulations and EV subsidies has ignited a seismic shift in capital allocation, favoring traditional automakers and energy-intensive industrial sectors. This policy pivot, framed as a rebuke to “overreaching climate mandates,” is not merely a regulatory reversal but a calculated realignment of U.S. economic priorities. By dismantling the EV subsidy framework and prioritizing domestic energy production, the administration is accelerating a capital flight from green-tech overvaluation to underappreciated industrial plays with robust balance sheets and domestic production capabilities.

Deregulation as a Catalyst for Detroit's Resurgence

The elimination of the “electric vehicle mandate” and the termination of state emissions waivers have created a regulatory vacuum that traditional automakers are swiftly filling. General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) stand to benefit most from the suspension of CAFE compliance obligations, which previously forced legacy automakers to purchase costly emissions credits from EV startups like Tesla and Rivian. GM's CFO, Paul Jacobson, , .

The administration's 25% tariff on imported vehicles further insulates Detroit from foreign competition. , the universal application of the tariff allows it to raise prices without losing market share. This dynamic is particularly advantageous for Ford, which has pivoted to lower-cost ICE models and plans to scale back U.S. EV production in favor of European markets.

Industrial Sectors: The Hidden Winners of Deregulation

Beyond automakers, the energy and materials sectors are experiencing a renaissance. Fossil fuel giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are capitalizing on the reversal of offshore wind moratoriums and the reinstatement of energy infrastructure permits. Meanwhile, underappreciated industrial stocks are emerging as alpha generators:

CNH Industrial (CNH): , this agricultural and construction equipment leader benefits from the administration's focus on domestic infrastructure and energy projects. Its precision agriculture innovations align with the renewed emphasis on traditional energy sectors.

Paccar (PCAR): , Paccar's heavy-duty trucks are critical for energy and materials logistics. Its insourced engine production and premium pricing power position it to outperform peers in a deregulated environment.

Idex (IEX): A specialty machinery firm producing mission-critical equipment for energy infrastructure, Idex's lean manufacturing and R&D-driven growth make it a compelling play on long-term industrial demand.

The Risks of Green-Tech Overvaluation

While the administration's policies favor traditional sectors, they also expose the fragility of green-tech valuations. Tesla's stock, which surged on EV subsidies, now faces headwinds as tax credits expire and demand softens. Similarly, Rivian and Lucid's reliance on regulatory compliance letters from NHTSA has evaporated, leaving their business models vulnerable. The Department of Energy's recent report downplaying carbon pollution controls further undermines the economic rationale for aggressive climate mitigation strategies.

Strategic Investment Outlook

For investors, the 2025 policy landscape presents a clear dichotomy: capital is flowing toward industrial and energy stocks with strong balance sheets and domestic production capabilities, while green-tech overvaluation faces correction. Traditional automakers like GM and Ford, alongside underappreciated industrial plays such as CNH and Paccar, offer a hedge against regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical volatility.

In conclusion, Trump's emissions rollback is not a mere policy shift but a strategic reallocation of capital toward sectors that align with U.S. energy independence and industrial resilience. For those seeking alpha in 2025, the path lies in underappreciated industrial stocks and traditional automakers poised to thrive in a deregulated, energy-intensive future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 02:59:50.621259

All told, around 155,000 MW of renewable energy capacity is currently being built, down from around 186,000 MW a year ago.
Solar power capacity is quick to build, and the total solar capacity in operation rose from 120,460 MW in 2024 to around 121,311 MW currently, GEM data shows.
Operating U.S. wind capacity increased from 150,592 MW in 2024 to 151,429 MW as of mid-2025.","U.S. power developers are planning to sharply boost natural gas and hydropower generation capacity and are cutting back on plans to add new solar and wind farms, according to recent data on the U.S. power capacity pipeline.

As of mid-2025, U.S. power developers had just over 114,000 megawatts (MW) of natural gas capacity under construction or in so-called pre-construction, according to data from Global Energy Monitor (GEM).

That capacity total is more than twice as large as what was in developer pipelines a year ago. Gas plants are the single largest power source among all planned capacity additions at the construction and pre-construction stages, GEM data shows.

Developers have also sharply lifted planned hydropower and nuclear generation capacity from a year ago, and have made cuts to both solar and wind capacity plans compared to mid-2024.

The large changes within the planned power capacity mix highlight the impact of the sudden swing in federal government energy policies following the reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump.

The gas-heavy development schedule also underscores how utilities are prioritizing dispatchable power sources over intermittent renewable energy as they scramble to ensure that electricity supplies keep up with rapidly rising demand.

FIRED UP

Natural gas plants make up around 46% of currently operational U.S. power capacity, and 36% of capacity at the construction and pre-construction phases.

Around 16,300 MW of gas capacity is currently under construction, while around 98,000 MW is in pre-construction, which is where sites have been identified and relevant permits have been applied for.

On top of the roughly 114,000 MW of natural gas power capacity, U.S. utilities are building or planning to build around 36,000 MW of new hydropower capacity and nearly 8,000 MW of new nuclear capacity.

Those diverse power sources have an important common attribute – they are all able to be dispatched on command by utilities in order to balance system power needs.

The total volume of dispatchable power capacity currently in the developer pipeline is around 159,000 MW, and compares to around 57,000 MW at the same stage a year ago.

CLEAN CUTS

The sharply rising capacity footprint for dispatchable power contrasts with the capacity pipeline for renewable energy, which is also known as intermittent power because it is only produced when the sun is shining and the wind blows.

Total solar capacity currently under construction or in pre-construction is around 92,000 MW, down from around 112,000 MW at the same developmental stages in 2024.

Current wind power capacity in development is around 65,000 MW, down from around 74,000 MW a year ago.

All told, around 155,000 MW of renewable energy capacity is currently being built, down from around 186,000 MW a year ago.

Some of the apparent cuts to the renewables development pipeline can be explained by the fact that some of the capacity that was previously being built is now operational.

Solar power capacity is quick to build, and the total solar capacity in operation rose from 120,460 MW in 2024 to around 121,311 MW currently, GEM data shows.

Operating U.S. wind capacity increased from 150,592 MW in 2024 to 151,429 MW as of mid-2025.

Other reasons for the cuts to the renewable pipeline include the growing wait times for new power assets to get connected to local grids, and the rising costs for parts and materials – especially for wind farms.

Steep cuts to future tax breaks and subsidies under the Trump administration have also led to cuts to some renewable power capacity plans, especially in states with already long interconnection wait times.

RE-CHARGING

Utilities are also rapidly building out new battery storage capacity so that surplus power from renewable assets can be stored and then discharged during peak demand periods.

Around 8,000 MW of battery capacity is currently planned to be added to the U.S. utility network by the end of the year, according to data from energy data portal Cleanview.

When brought online, that new battery capacity would bring total U.S. utility-scale battery capacity to around 46,000 MW by the end of the year.

That expanded battery capacity will allow utilities to make better use of the renewable power capacity already in place, and ensure that solar generation that exceeds system demand needs during the sunniest periods can be stored for later use.

That in turn will ensure that the overall power mix within the U.S. generation system will continue to get cleaner over time, even if the pace of new solar and wind capacity growth continues to slow compared to previous years.

That said, the ramped-up gas development pipeline will ensure that natural gas remains the central pillar of the U.S. generation system once current construction and pre-construction of all power types is complete.

STAYING GAS-HEAVY

Gas capacity’s share of the overall U.S. power system will remain more than twice as large as any other power source, at 44%, once construction and pre-construction work is complete.

However, coal capacity will be overtaken by both wind and solar once the current construction binge is finished.

Coal has a roughly 15% share of total currently operating capacity, while wind has a 12% share and solar has a 10% share.

Expected changes to US power capacity by source after construction

Thomson ReutersExpected changes to US power capacity by source after construction

Once projects that are currently under construction and in pre-construction are complete, both wind and solar will have a roughly 14% share while coal power’s share will drop to around 12%.

That greater footprint from renewables will mean that clean power sources will boost their overall share of the capacity mix from 39% currently to 44% after building work is complete.

That in turn means that while the U.S. power system will remain primarily gas-fed, clean power sources will account for most of the rest and will play a key role in the ongoing pollution reduction efforts of the U.S. energy system.

About $44 million a year would be rebated to Whitehaven for its Winchester South coal mine under the fuel tax credit scheme, which is facing renewed scrutiny for its drag on public finances and decarbonisation goals.

The tax exemptions were introduced decades ago when the Commonwealth first introduced fuel taxes, based on the principle that off-road users should be spared from the costs of maintaining infrastructure.

Fuel tax is no longer ring-fenced for road repairs, however, and critics argue the scheme has become too costly – clocking in at roughly $11 billion a year – and keeping diesel users hooked on the emissions-intensive fuel.

In a first for Lock the Gate, the anti-coal and gas campaigner has seized on the fuel tax credits available to a specific coal mine as a line of critique.

Whitehaven’s proposed metallurgical and thermal coal mine in Queensland’s Bowen Basin is already facing legal challenge from other conservation groups worried about native species, water sources and the climate, including both burning the coal and the methane that tends to escape as it’s dug up.

Lock the Gate’s focus on fuel tax credits follows a push to reform the scheme ahead of the Labor government’s economic reform summit.

Notably, the Australian Council of Trade Unions called for a $20 million cap on diesel tax exemptions ahead of the productivity talks, hot on the heels of Climate Energy Finance’s suggestion of a $50 million ceiling on annual fuel tax credits per company.

The think tank’s model would allow businesses to claim rebates beyond the cap if they reinvested the funds into decarbonisation, such as electric trucks.

Director Tim Buckley said the “cap-and-reinvest” model had been well-received in Canberra and would only capture big miners, with farmers and small businesses well below the threshold.

Without reform, he said mining companies had little incentive to shift away from diesel – responsible for 17 per cent of Australia’s annual emissions – and embrace fast-advancing clean alternatives.

A Whitehaven spokesperson said large-scale electrification in mining remained “technically and commercially challenging” but the miner was monitoring developments in lower-emissions options.

Responding to the Lock the Gate analysis, the company spokesperson said the fuel tax excise was designed as a “user pay system” for maintaining public roads and the credit scheme complemented it by ensuring off-road mining, construction and agriculture companies did not bear the cost.

The mining sector’s contribution to the national economy “far outweighs any credit received under the system”, the spokesperson said.

The Lock the Gate analysis drew on Whitehaven-released data to estimate 85 million litres of diesel would be used by the Winchester South coal mine each year and more than 2.5 billion litres across its lifetime.

In 2025 dollars, this would result in the mine receiving about $44 million each year from the fuel tax credit scheme, or more than $1.3 billion throughout the mine’s operating life.

This total is more than the $1 billion needed to develop the mine, as pointed out by Lock the Gate Alliance national co-ordinator Ellen Roberts.

The Winchester South coal mine has secured state-level approval and is undergoing assessment through federal environmental laws.

""Both energy security and food security are massively important to the UK, and partnering with Acorn Bioenergy helps us deliver both.""
Acorn Bioenergy is currently developing two additional plants in the UK, along with a dedicated gas injection hub.
The company was acquired in 2022 by Qualitas Energy, a global investor and developer in renewable energy, energy transition, and sustainable infrastructure.","Acorn Bioenergy launched its first anaerobic digestion (AD) plant in Winchester on Thursday, September 4. Located at Three Maids Hill, the plant converts agricultural residues and waste into biomethane, which supplies renewable gas to the national grid.

The facility, officially opened at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, Winchester City Council leader Martin Tod, and partner farmers, is now fully operational.

Sarah Jones, Minister for Industry, said: ""Acorn’s development will deliver secure, clean energy for thousands of homes and provide jobs for the local community in Hampshire.

""Biomethane can play an important role in reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels, boosting our energy security and helping us accelerate to net zero.""

The plant processes 83,600 tonnes of agricultural waste and break crops each year, generating more than 120 GWh of biomethane which is enough to meet the heating needs of more than 9,000 homes.

By converting farming by-products such as slurries, manures, and rotational crops into green energy, the facility is expected to save around 30,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually.

This equates to removing 15,000 cars from the road or planting 1.2 million trees.

Alister Veitch, head of business development at Acorn Bioenergy, described the site as a ""flagship hub"" for the company.

Mr Veitch said: ""We were delighted to launch the Three Maids facility, to demonstrate how renewable biogas generation can power homes, strengthen food security and support the UK’s net zero ambitions.

""Alongside our dozen sites in development, it is a major step towards our ambition to supply 25 per cent of the UK’s biomethane.""

Cllr Jackie Porter, who attended the launch event, said: ""The whole site is now operational which is really exciting. It's good to see it actually working and to see the support they are getting for it. We want to make sure it works really well with the community as well.

""My hope is that we can use this site with other sites as well, to really educate our whole community on the ways in which we can reduce our carbon footprint.""

The site, situated near a solar farm and InstaVolt’s EV superhub off the A34, forms part of Winchester’s growing renewable energy cluster.

It has created 15 direct jobs and is expected to support up to 50 roles across the wider engineering, rural, and infrastructure sectors.

The plant also produces nutrient-rich digestate, a bio-fertiliser used to improve soil health which reduces reliance on imported, carbon-intensive fertilisers.

In addition, the facility generates high-purity green CO₂ for sustainable industrial applications.

Nick Rowsell of West Stoke Farm, who supplies break crops to the plant, said: ""Having farmed at Three Maids Hill previously, we always found the land had limited agricultural value.

""However, it has strong potential with this new renewable biogas generation facility which we are now providing feedstock for.

""Both energy security and food security are massively important to the UK, and partnering with Acorn Bioenergy helps us deliver both.""

The project offers fixed-pricing agreements and lower fertiliser costs through digestate use.

It also gives farmers a reliable outlet for break crops grown as part of sustainable rotations.

By producing continuous renewable gas, the Winchester plant complements intermittent sources such as wind and solar, helping to stabilise the UK’s energy grid.

It also supports the Government’s aim to quadruple biomethane production by 2030–2035.

Acorn Bioenergy is currently developing two additional plants in the UK, along with a dedicated gas injection hub.

Amid this transformation, LG Energy Solution (LGES) stands out as a strategic contender, leveraging its production scale, R&D prowess, and strategic partnerships to position itself at the forefront of the battery revolution. For investors, the question is whether LGES can sustain its momentum amid fierce competition and technological uncertainty.

Market Position and Financial Resilience

LGES currently holds a 14.5% global market share in EV batteries, ranking third behind CATL and Panasonic [1]. Its U.S. expansion is particularly noteworthy: By 2025, the company is projected to become the largest EV battery supplier in the region, fueled by partnerships with Tesla, General Motors, and Hyundai [1]. This growth is underpinned by a KRW 6.3 trillion revenue in Q1 2025 and an 8.8% operating profit margin in Q2 2025, driven by cost-cutting measures and U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits [3][5].

The company’s pivot to energy storage systems (ESS) further diversifies its revenue streams. By 2026, LGES aims to double its ESS production capacity in Michigan to 30GWh, capitalizing on the growing demand for grid-scale storage [5]. This strategic flexibility—shifting production lines from EV cells to ESS—demonstrates LGES’s ability to adapt to market dynamics, a critical trait in an industry prone to rapid shifts.

Next-Gen Battery Innovation: The R&D Edge

LGES’s long-term growth hinges on its ability to lead in next-generation battery technologies. The company is investing heavily in solid-state, lithium-sulfur (Li-S), and bipolar battery development. A key milestone: LGES plans to mass-produce Li-S batteries by 2027, a technology that promises 500 Wh/kg energy density—a leap beyond current lithium-ion standards [2]. By integrating bipolar designs, LGES aims to reduce component counts and enhance energy density, positioning itself as a leader in compact, high-performance batteries [2].

Comparatively, LGES’s R&D spend of $1 billion annually lags behind CATL’s $3 billion in 2023 [1][3]. However, LGES’s focus on lean electrolyte systems and cylindrical battery technology—such as its recent $1 billion deal with Chinese automaker Chery—highlights its agility in commercializing niche innovations [2]. Meanwhile, CATL’s dominance in condensed batteries (500 Wh/kg) and Panasonic’s delays in U.S. production underscore the competitive landscape’s volatility [1][2].

Production Capacity and Strategic Partnerships

LGES’s ambition to expand production to 540 GWh by 2025 is a bold bet on sustained EV demand [1]. This capacity, supported by partnerships with GM, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, positions LGES to meet North American automakers’ nearshoring needs. In contrast, CATL’s 390 GWh capacity and 37% market share in 2023 reflect its entrenched position in China and Europe [1]. Yet, LGES’s U.S. IRA tax credits and Michigan ESS expansion provide a unique tailwind, insulating it from China-centric supply chain risks.

Risks and Competitive Challenges

Despite its strengths, LGES faces headwinds. The EV battery market is highly cyclical, with prices falling due to overcapacity and raw material volatility [4]. Additionally, CATL’s technological edge in battery recycling (99.6% metal recovery) and Panasonic’s 4680 cell expertise pose long-term threats [3]. Geopolitical tensions, such as China’s export controls on critical minerals, could also disrupt LGES’s supply chain [3].

Investment Thesis

LGES’s combination of financial resilience, strategic diversification, and next-gen R&D makes it a compelling long-term play. While CATL’s scale and Panasonic’s legacy in consumer electronics are formidable, LGES’s U.S. IRA alignment, ESS pivot, and Li-S roadmap offer asymmetric upside. For investors, the key is to monitor the company’s ability to commercialize its 10-minute charge batteries and maintain margins amid price wars.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 02:59:46.355358

Bill to create long term jobs and business opportunities for Western Australians

Bold new legislation will be introduced by the Cook Government this week to unlock strategic precincts, fast-track approvals for major strategic projects around the State and maintain Western Australia as the strongest economy in the nation.

The State Development Bill 2025 will establish a modern and agile framework and is a major part of the Cook Government's strategy to make WA a global leader in investment attraction, industry facilitation and regulation.

The Bill is a key response to discussions at the Trade and Economic Resilience roundtable convened by the Premier in May this year. It builds upon the government's recent commitment to establish a WA Productivity Commission, as well as the nation-leading planning and environmental approvals reforms delivered during the last term of government.

The Bill aims to future-proof WA's regulatory system, ensuring our high standards of protection are maintained while streamlining complex and time-sensitive processes. It will allow the Premier to declare State Development Areas and Priority Projects, supported by the Coordinator General who will be delegated statutory powers to coordinate across agencies and facilitate regulatory processes.

The Coordinator General will be provided with tools, including information notices, timeframe notices, due regard notices, joint decision notices and modification orders, all designed to ensure major strategic opportunities are delivered in an investment-friendly timeframe.

This new framework will enable a more strategic approach to State Development by increasing the certainty of end-to-end project approval timeframes, ensuring WA remains globally competitive and investment ready.

The new laws are designed to help WA secure major new economic diversification opportunities in support of the government Made in WA agenda, including:

Getting out of coal fired power generation faster than any other Australian state, and setting the WA economy up for success in a world that is decarbonising;

Supporting WA's major trading partners to decarbonise, with critical minerals and clean downstream products, like green iron; and

Becoming the largest naval shipbuilding and maintenance hub in the southern hemisphere.

The Coordinator General's new role and powers will only be applied to the most significant precincts and opportunities. All other major private sector projects will continue to be driven by the Department of Energy and Economic Diversification, with the lead agency process retained. The government is also working on an additional round of general approvals reforms, which will be progressed in 2026.

Importantly, the legislation respects the independence of the Environmental Protection Authority and respects existing Aboriginal heritage protections, facilitating coordination across government while preserving the integrity of existing safeguards.

Over the past decade, Chinese companies have played a fundamental role in the expansion of Argentina’s clean energy infrastructure, both through financing and direct participation in large projects.

However, recent geopolitical and economic changes, such as the current Argentine government’s closer alignment with the United States over China, the significant cuts made to Argentina’s public infrastructure budget since 2024, and global trade tensions, cast doubt on China’s interest in maintaining that financing momentum.

This comes amid concerns about the future of renewable energy in Argentina, where the relevant regulatory framework, covering the period of 2015 to 2025, is reaching its conclusion. Law 27,191 established incentives to target 16% of electricity demand being met with renewable sources by the end of 2021, rising to 18% by the end of 2023 and 20% by the end of this year.

According to official data, the share of renewables in Argentina’s electricity mix reached 13% in 2021, rose to 14.3% in 2023, and averaged 17.2% in the first four months of 2025. Of the renewable energy generated so far this year, 70% has come from wind power, followed by solar power with 19%.

“Chinese investment in renewable energy in Argentina has shown sustained growth and diversification both in terms of technology and geography,” said Oriana Cherini, a researcher in international relations at the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research (Conicet).

“Companies such as PowerChina and Envision have developed wind and solar projects in several provinces, within a framework of cooperation initially promoted at the national level, and coordinated through instruments such as Argentina’s accession to the Belt and Road Initiative,” she added.

Among the most significant Chinese solar projects is the Cauchari solar park, in Argentina’s northern province of Jujuy. It has 312 megawatts of installed capacity, which is expected to be expanded to 500 MW. The plant was mainly financed by the Export-Import Bank of China (Exim) and built by PowerChina, Shanghai Electric Construction and Talesun. Another notable project is the Cafayate solar park in the north-western Calchaquí Valley, built by PowerChina and inaugurated in 2019, with a capacity of 97.6 MW.

China also has a significant presence in the wind sector, backing four wind farms with a total installed capacity of 355 MW in Loma Blanca, in the southern province of Chubut. These projects were built by PowerChina and are operated by the Chinese firm Goldwind, as is the Miramar wind farm in the south of Buenos Aires province, with 96 MW of capacity.

Factors at play

According to Stella Maris Juste, a Conicet researcher with a PhD in international relations, one of the main impediments to the development of new projects is the availability of funds from large Chinese institutions such as its policy banks, the Exim Bank and the China Development Bank – “the ones that normally finance investments in renewables” in Argentina, she said.

A recent report by the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University in the United States detailed that China allocated USD 472 billion in public financing and public guarantees to low- and middle-income countries around the world between 2008 and 2024. According to the report, however, current lending levels are well below the highs recorded in 2015-2017; total lending from the two institutions to Latin America and the Caribbean averaged just USD 1.3 billion per year between 2019 and 2023.

On the other hand, the report says foreign direct investment (FDI) from Chinese companies is on the rise: “Chinese FDI has skyrocketed, both in absolute terms and in relation to development financing. This change could reflect a maturing of the Belt and Road Initiative, as Chinese companies gain experience abroad and are able to take on project management themselves.” The trend is apparent in other locations where China invests, such as Indonesia.

For Juste, government programmes launched to stimulate renewables in Argentina, such as RenovAR in 2016, which now no longer exist, facilitated the mobilisation of resources at an earlier stage. Added to this is the geopolitical factor of strained relations: “When political ties are strong, there is more synergy in financial cooperation,” she said.

Juste and Cherini agreed on the growing importance of Argentina’s subnational governments for Chinese investment, given President Javier Milei’s closer alignment with the United States.

Until 2023, the national government played a facilitating role in relations with China, favouring strategic agreements. This is no longer the case – now it is the provinces taking the initiative. “Through subnational agendas, many of them are promoting direct links, becoming key players in energy cooperation,” said Cherini.

Future prospects

One of the factors impacting the renewable sector’s outlook is the expiry of the 2015 renewable energy law at the end of this year.

Gustavo Castagnino, who directs corporate, regulatory and sustainability affairs at the renewable energy firm Genneia, said an extension of the law is being pushed for. This would maintain the 20% target, for a deadline yet to be confirmed, along with the legal and fiscal protections for those investing in the sector.

“Energy demand will remain steady in the coming years, and renewable energy is very competitive today, so we expect penetration to grow strongly anyway,” Castagnino added.

Camila Mercure, who coordinates climate policy at the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (FARN), an NGO, argues that although this year’s targets are unlikely to be met, the law was an important tool for the sector’s development. “Not updating the law creates barriers and challenges for the transition in our country,” she says. “Above all, it creates great uncertainty about what energy policy will look like in terms of renewables in the coming years.”

Another key factor when analysing the future of Argentina’s renewables sector is the lack of infrastructure development for electricity transmission, needed to support sources such as wind and solar. Significant Chinese investment has arrived in transmission projects in neighbouring Brazil and Chile, while in 2022, China’s State Grid announced plans to invest USD 1 billion in grid upgrades around Buenos Aires. But these grid shortcomings in Argentina have limited growth opportunities in recent years. In May, the government presented a plan for the private sector to finance 16 priority transmission projects.

“The electricity system needs new investment in generation, transmission and distribution to ensure more competitive energy – i.e. lower costs and a more secure system,” said Castagnino.

As such, Mercure said that the country’s limited electricity transmission infrastructure is making distributed generation – for example, solar panels fitted to a house or powering a micro-grid – an appealing option. Argentina currently has just 78MW of installed distributed electricity capacity, and approximately 2,900 electricity-generating users. Almost all of these users rely on solar panels, practically all of which in Argentina are imported from China – though the country’s first domestic factory is set to enter production this year.

These challenges around transmission, Mercure said, are “an invitation to move towards distributed generation schemes, precisely because they allow generation to be brought closer to consumption centers”.",https://chinaglobalsouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Argentina-solar2-768x432.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 22:58:46.895068

The region contributes approximately 23 per cent of Australia’s industrial emissions, due to its heavy concentration of hard-to-abate mining, resources and industrial sectors.

The new report, written by Marsden Jacob Associates (MJA) and titled Common user transmission and decarbonising Pilbara energy demand, advocates for a Common User Transmission Infrastructure (CUTI) system, enabling “multiple users and generators to connect to a single, shared grid, replacing the traditional model where each miner builds and operates private, siloed infrastructure.”

According to a summary of findings from the CEFC, the report finds a $30 billion savings opportunity versus “a fragmented, go-it-alone approach”, which is made up of “$4 billion in avoided transmission costs and $26 billion in avoided generation and storage costs over 25 years.”

It also claims a 21 per cent reduction in land required for transmission, 29 per cent reduction in new transmission line length under the CUTI approach, and 16 per cent reduction in required renewable energy and storage capacity assets.

Ian Learmonth, the CEO of the CEFC, said on Monday that, “This report confirms that smarter, shared infrastructure delivers both climate and economic wins. It is the kind of solution that strengthens Australia’s position as a future energy superpower.

“We are proud to support this work, building on the WA Government’s leadership in advancing shared transmission planning in the Pilbara. It shows what can be achieved when policy leadership, commercial opportunity and clean energy innovation come together with a shared goal.”

But its true impact extends well beyond incentives: OBBBA is unsettling the entire financial and insurance underpinning of the U.S. clean energy industry.

OBBBA has accelerated deadlines, with projects now required to begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. It has also removed the 5% cost-based safe harbor starting September 1, 2025, meaning that only physical work counts toward eligibility. That change alone has lenders and insurers spooked, uncertain when or if returns will materialize.

Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs on essential materials like steel, copper, and solar components have pushed construction costs even higher. “We’re really now seeing the impacts of what the new reality in the U.S. has meant for investor confidence,” says Meredith Annex, Head of Clean Power at BloombergNEF, after reporting that wind and solar investments plunged 36% year-on-year to $36.4 billion in H1 2025, with onshore wind collapsing 80 percent, the Financial Times reported.

At the same time, insurance is becoming a major issue. Underwriters are recalibrating risk models that now include political unpredictability. As Canaan Crouch of Jencap Specialty Insurance Services warns, “Higher insurance premiums add another cost burden to contractors and developers already grappling with reduced subsidies, higher tariffs and volatile demand.” That’s effectively redefining how projects are valued and bankrolled.

Insurers are tightening their terms in ways that directly reshape project economics. Premiums for utility-scale solar and offshore wind have climbed sharply over the past year, with underwriters increasingly carving out exclusions for mechanical failure and weather-related damage, according to Reuters. Industry brokers say some carriers have shortened policy durations from three years to one, forcing developers to renegotiate coverage annually at higher cost. In offshore wind, several European reinsurers have already reduced their U.S. exposure, leaving a smaller pool of carriers willing to underwrite billion-dollar projects and driving up rates for those that remain.

The disruption is being felt by the industry’s biggest players. Denmark’s Ørsted, once a clean-energy trailblazer, has approved a $9.4 billion emergency rights issue after its U.S. offshore wind projects, Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, hit policy roadblocks. Construction on Revolution Wind, almost 80% complete, was halted by a federal stop-work order citing national security concerns, prompting Ørsted to sue the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the company is burning millions weekly in holding costs, and S&P Global has already downgraded its credit rating though Equinor, a 10% shareholder, has pledged up to $941 million in support.

Nor is this limited to utility-scale clean energy.

In residential solar, firms like Sunnova and Mosaic have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy amid uncertainty over tax credits and a decline in demand. Canary Media reported that Sunnova laid off over half its workforce (over 700 employees) before filing, citing untenable debt and market retrenchment. Mosaic, a major residential solar loan provider, also went bankrupt, pointing to macroeconomic headwinds and policy unpredictability.

These are not small casualties. Analysts predict a 50-60% reduction in residential solar demand, risking over 250,000 jobs. As Ara Agopian, CEO of Solar Insure, put it, “There’s going to be a 50 to 60 percent downturn in demand. Many of them will shut their doors as they can’t stay in business without the tax credit.” The Financial Times noted that Guggenheim’s Joe Osha underscored the long-standing difficulties.

In Sunnova’s case, a July 31, 2025 court approval allowed the sale of substantially all assets to a creditor group highlighting how even bankruptcy is being managed to mitigate fallout for homeowners.

States are also feeling the heat, with Texas, once a renewable stronghold, seeing developers cancel or delay nearly $8 billion in projects, while BloombergNEF has tallied over $22 billion in clean energy development shelved nationally, costing more than 16,000 jobs.

Beyond wind and solar, OBBBA’s implications also extend to battery and hydrogen sectors. The law phases out credits for battery manufacturing and accelerates deadlines for hydrogen projects under Section 45V. Experts at the International Council on Clean Transportation estimate U.S. battery production could fall 75 percent short of expectations by 2030, cutting into the clean energy value chain.

Banks that once offered competitive terms on project loans are now widening spreads to reflect heightened policy risk, while credit rating agencies have flagged uncertainty over future cash flows as a trigger for downgrades. Institutional investors that fueled the tax-equity boom of the past decade are becoming more selective, in some cases pausing commitments entirely until the regulatory landscape stabilizes. The result is a much smaller pipeline of available capital and steeper financing costs for developers.

What’s emerging is a clarity that OBBBA’s biggest impact may be the erosion of the industry’s financial ecosystem. Insurance premiums are climbing. Lenders are retreating or demanding new risk-adjusted returns. Developers are cannibalizing capital just to stay afloat.

Guest Opinion. One of the things that is never mentioned is something that both President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump agree on and that is increasing the nuclear power capacity in the U.S. Biden had a goal of tripling nuclear energy; Trump has a goal of quadrupling nuclear energy. Biden planned for 200GW by 2050; Trump’s goal is 400GW by 2050. In a recent survey, 61% of Americans favor nuclear energy.

The reasons may include reduced carbon emissions and compliance with our commitments on international climate change agreements, but the elephant in the room is the electricity appetite of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The electricity needs for data centers that run artificial intelligence applications cannot be met with existing energy resources. According to the MIT Technology Review: “In the US, estimates from industry and academia suggest energy demand for data centers could be as high as 400 terawatt-hours by 2030—up from fewer than 100 terawatt-hours in 2020 and higher than the total electricity demand from the entire country of Mexico.

One of the ways both presidents planned/plan to meet their goals is by building new nuclear reactor capacity, but also by recommissioning nuclear power plants that may have been decommissioned.

Remembering the 1970s and the context for the creation of these nuclear power plants: The commercial nuclear energy industry started in the U.S. with the first nuclear reactor going online in 1969 (Nine Mile Island), followed by others in 1971(Palisades) and 1974 (Three Mile Island). The first nuclear power plant to start operating in December 1969, the same month that one of the most sweeping environmental statutes in the world was passed, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. In July 1970, President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through his reorganization plan. Yet nuclear power was not embraced as a clean alternative but as far too dangerous to humans and the environment.

Then in 1979, Three Mile Island had its infamous nuclear plant accident. Through a series of human errors, Unit 2 suffered a meltdown that produced radiation and caused the need to evacuate people within a five mile radius of the plant. Fortunately, there were no injuries and no deaths as a result of the accident. However, Unit 2 was permanently closed, and Unit 1 continued to produce energy until 2019.

The Palisades has been closed since 2022 and going into decommission status; while Three Mile Island stopped its last nuclear reactor Unit 1 in 2019.

Nuclear Energy Status

The United States now has 94 operating commercial nuclear reactors at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states. The average age of these nuclear reactors is about 42 years old.

The oldest operating reactor, Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in New York, began commercial operation in December 1969. The newest reactor to enter commercial service is Unit 3 at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia, which began commercial operation on July 31, 2023, and is the first reactor to come online since Watts Bar 2 was commissioned in 2016.

Of the 54 operating nuclear power plants, 19 have one reactor, 31 have two reactors, four have three reactors and one has four reactors. The U.S. nuclear energy industry has supplied about 20% of total annual U.S. electricity since 1990.

How do you decommission a nuclear power plant?

We have never decommissioned a nuclear power plant, so the first one will be a precedent setting regulatory process. It looks like the Palisades Nuclear Energy plant located in Covert Township, Michigan on the Lake Michigan shore, will be the first. The beginning of Palisades was nearly six decades ago. Construction started in 1967 and the plant began operation in 1971. The nuclear power plant was owned originally by Consumers Energy and purchased by Entergy in 2006. The following year it was granted renewal of its license to operate which would be current until 2031. But Entergy said the nuclear energy market was no longer viable, stopped operation and sold it for scrap to Holtec in 2022. Holtec then changed from decommissioning to restarting — something that had never been done.

There are two new legal authorities for decommissioning and bringing back into operation these nuclear power plants. The ADVANCE Act of 2024, intended to modernize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and its processes; and Trump’s Executive Order 14302 Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base (May 23, 2025). Both support more efficient processes to approve licensing. The executive order specifically addresses “restarts” as important.

In the case of Palisades, they moved from decommissioned status to an operating license. NRC notes in their press release that “while these NRC approvals will allow Holtec to load fuel, there are still several licensing actions under NRC review and additional requirements that need to be met before the plant can start up under the original operating license, which would expire March 24, 2031.”

NRC approved the transfer of all licenses from the previous owner, Entergy to Holtec Decommissioning International LLC to Palisades Energy LLC.

Actions that make a restart viable is the acceptance of previous documents and programs by NRC, including “technical specifications, emergency plan, emergency action levels, and physical security plan, as well as programs for quality assurance, maintenance, and inservice inspections.” They are also using an Environmental Assessment from May 2025 where they made a finding of no significant impact on the environment (FONSI) which means no Environmental Impact Statement is needed.

So Palisades can now receive uranium for its nuclear reactor and begin the process of testing for their operating license. As NRC said, the plan will not open until it is safe and however long that is, is how long it will take. Palisades anticipates to begin operation in 2027 after spending $1.5 billion in renovations (government funded).

What of Three Mile Island?

Meanwhile Three Mile Island is watching the Palisades precedent. Three Mile Island, while decommissioned in 2019, was bought by Constellation to bring it back into operating status. They also expect to spend $1.5 billion to bring it back to operating condition. The renamed Three Mile Island, the Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center, has contracted with Microsoft to produce energy exclusively for their data center needs to fuel their artificial intelligence needs for 20 years. They will be selling it for $115-120 per MW, which is above market price of about $110 per GM. The Crane Center anticipates opening in 2028.

From here?

We’ve only just begun (also the title of a hit song released in 1970) to build our nuclear energy capacity with an ambitious goal of quadrupling that capacity. Ensuring these first projects are done safely and without incident is critical. Given we have had almost half a century to improve on safety and efficiency, we are more accepting of the known risks than we were with the unknown risks of the 1970s, with 61% of Americans now favoring nuclear energy. New types of reactors are under development and the new micro-reactor is in the proof of concept stage, but promising.

If we restart these two old and infamous nuclear energy plants built almost half a century ago, we will have achieved a pathway to our carbon free, high volume, consistent production of electricity resource. It seems our love affair with nuclear energy is heating up again for America, ‘cause “breakin up is hard to do” (another song from the 1970s) when it comes to nuclear energy.

The US doesn’t know what it is missing…or just doesn’t realize it.

Chinese automotive giant BYD has established a significant foothold in Europe’s commercial vehicle market, leveraging its electric bus expertise while expanding into freight transport as the continent accelerates its transition to zero-emission transportation.

BYD is in America through purpose-built vehicles, mostly school buses and special application vehicles which are built by the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation (SMART) Workers Union, Local 105. The number of BYD-platform vehicles produced in the US is relevant to targets under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), which created the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean School Bus (CSB) Program to fund electric school buses.

Compare the numbers to what is going in Europe, and there is so much room to grow.

Operating In Most Of Europe

The company’s most visible success has been in electric buses, with BYD vehicles now operating in major European cities, including Amsterdam, Madrid, Barcelona, Budapest, and Milan. This urban presence represents part of BYD’s global deployment of 70,000 electric buses worldwide, though Europe accounts for just 2.5% of that total volume as of early 2022.

BYD faces substantial competition in the European electric bus market, where domestic manufacturers maintain strong positions. In the first half of 2023, Poland’s Solaris, Germany’s MAN, and the BYD-ADL partnership held the top three market positions. However, the overall market is expanding rapidly, with battery-electric bus registrations reaching 5,315 units in the first half of 2025 alone.

The growth trajectory appears sustainable, with Europe’s electric bus market projected to reach $9.44 billion by 2034, driven by environmental regulations and the transition to sustainable public transport. France, the UK, Poland, the Netherlands, and Germany collectively account for more than half of Europe’s current electric bus fleet.

In The Logistics Space

Beyond buses, BYD has developed a comprehensive electric truck lineup for European logistics. The ETM6, a 7.5-ton truck with 200-kilometer range, targets urban delivery operations with payload options of 3,810kg or 3,740kg. Its 255 kWh battery charges from 20% to 100% in two hours, being designed for frequent urban cycles.

The company also offers the ETP3 compact panel van for tight urban spaces, and the EYT 2.0, a heavy-duty port and airport cargo truck capable of handling combined gross weights up to 75 tons for large containers and trailers.

All BYD commercial vehicles use the company’s iron-phosphate Blade Battery technology, which BYD positions as offering superior safety and reliability compared to other lithium-ion chemistries. The vehicles include advanced driver assistance systems such as lane departure warning, forward collision warning, 360-degree vision, and adaptive cruise control.

BYD’s European expansion strategy focuses on establishing local partnerships and adapting to regional logistics needs. The company has recently entered markets like Hungary and maintains an active presence at major industry events such as Germany’s IAA Transportation trade show.

This targeted approach reflects the fragmented nature of global commercial vehicle markets, where regulatory frameworks, infrastructure capabilities, and operational patterns vary significantly between regions. BYD’s European success stems from adapting its electric vehicle expertise to local requirements rather than applying a universal product strategy.

What BYD is doing in Europe contrasts with its strategy in other markets. While the company produces pickup trucks like the Shark for markets in Asia and Latin America, it has not introduced such vehicles in Europe, focusing instead on urban logistics solutions that align with European cities’ emphasis on dense, efficient freight movement.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sweden-bus-img.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 22:00:30.713302

It wasn’t so long ago that automobile makers moaned about the state’s stringent anti-smog rules – rules that compelled Detroit to produce cars for California and a more polluting car for the other 49 states. In time, technology and the power of the marketplace led to the production and sale of cars that were less polluting in all 50 states.

Now the state means to take the lead again with regulations to reduce tailpipe emissions by requiring improved fuel economy.

Predictably, the auto industry is howling, which means lawsuits will follow.

Too bad. Even if improved mileage standards made no impact on the environment, Americans are coming to understand all the reasons that fuel efficiency is only common sense.

Among them: Gasoline costs more than $2.25 a gallon. High energy costs and the foreign trade deficit (fueled by U.S. dependence on foreign oil) are dragging down the growth of the U.S. economy. American troops are living in harm’s way in an effort to maintain some stability in what happens to be the most petroleum-rich region in the world. Besides, energy conservation is good for the environment.

And so the state Air Resources Board last week published rule changes designed to curb energy waste and global warming.

The plan would require manufacturers to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by almost 30 percent by the year 2014.

The proposal responds to the majority of scientists who have concluded that the increased burning of fossil fuels is accelerating global climate change and all the associated unhappy consequences.

The new rules can be read online at www.arb.ca.gov./cc/cc.htm. Public comments are being accepted through July 6.

Congress and the Bush administration, populated by former oil company executives, have resisted efforts to make vehicles more efficient, and they can be expected to join the auto industry in opposing California’s effort to protect the planet.

Along the way, they will line up a minority of scientists who claim that it is still to be proved that global warming is caused by fossil fuel emissions.

But here’s their problem: Even if that were true, consumers and the families of American servicemen and women can still identify several other reasons that fuel efficiency serves the national interest.",https://www.pressdemocrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/press-democrat.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 07:58:39.743157

While some believe they have found sustainable solutions to dispose of nuclear waste, there is still widespread debate around how safe these methods are and the potential long-term impact of waste disposal and storage. In the United Kingdom, the government has put nuclear power back on the agenda, after decades with no new nuclear developments; however, managing nuclear waste continues to be a major barrier to development.

Nuclear waste remains radioactive for around 10,000 years, meaning it is vital that governments dispose of all waste effectively to ensure people and the environment are kept safe in the long term. As more governments welcome a new nuclear era, they must address nuclear waste concerns and establish clear guidelines and regulations on disposal to ensure that all nuclear power companies adhere to strong safety standards and practices.

There are three types of nuclear waste: low-, intermediate-, and high-level radioactive waste. Most of the waste produced at nuclear facilities is lightly contaminated, including items such as tools and work clothing, with a level of around 1 percent radioactivity. Meanwhile, spent fuel is an example of high-level waste, which contributes around 3 percent of the total volume of waste from nuclear energy production. However, this contains around 95 percent of the radioactivity, making adequate waste management of these products extremely important.

In the U.K., the government continues to battle with how best to dispose of its nuclear waste, as it looks to expand the industry over the coming decades. The U.K. has 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste from its previous nuclear power activities, a figure that will grow as more nuclear projects come online. The government is now considering the development of a massive underground nuclear dump, known as a geological deposit facility (GDF), to safely dispose of the waste. While no site has been confirmed for development, it is expected to be developed in one of two potential sites in Cumbria, in the north of England.

A U.K. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson stated, “Constructing the UK’s first geological disposal facility will provide an internationally recognised safe and permanent disposal of the most hazardous radioactive waste.” They added, “Progress continues to be made in areas taking part in the siting process for this multibillion-pound facility, which would bring thousands of skilled jobs and economic growth to the local area.”

However, the U.K. Treasury believes the government’s plan for the waste dump is “unachievable”, rating the project as “red”, or not possible, in a recent assessment. This means that, “There are major issues with project definition, schedule, budget, quality and/or benefits delivery, which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable. The project may need rescoping and/or its overall viability reassessed.” In addition, there are concerns over the projected project cost, which is expected to be anywhere up to $73 billion.

Richard Outram, the secretary of Nuclear Free Local Authorities, explained, “The Nista red rating is hardly surprising. The GDF process is fraught with uncertainties, and the GDF ‘solution’ remains unproven and costly.”

At present, the U.K. stores most of its nuclear waste at its Sellafield facility in Cumbria, which is viewed as one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites worldwide. However, with the planned decommissioning of several power plants and the development of new nuclear facilities, the government must address its imminent waste issue. This is a long-term problem, with it expected to take until 2150 to dispose of the country’s existing waste into a GDF, if one is developed, before disposing of new waste.

In June, Lincolnshire County Council withdrew from being a potential site for the GDF after engaging with communities about the proposal. This is a common problem with developing nuclear waste sites, as the pushback in proposed waste regions often prevents development due to a not-in-my-backyard perspective from residents in the area. It is still unclear whether communities in Cumbria will hold a similar opinion. Corhyn Parr, the CEO of Nuclear Waste Services, said, “A GDF requires a suitable site and a willing community and will only be developed when both are in place.”

Several countries around the globe are battling with how best to dispose of old and new nuclear waste, as a nuclear renaissance is starting to be seen, in line with global aims for a green transition. While nuclear power is now viewed as extremely safe and clean, there are pressing concerns around the adequate disposal of waste, which can be extremely harmful to human health and the environment if improperly managed, that must be rapidly addressed.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s September 3, 2025 withdrawal of its proposed rule revising “effluent limitations guidelines” for the Meat and Poultry Products point source category, in support of the National Pollution and Discharge Elimination System permits program, is a prime example of the Agency exercising its statutory discretion under the Clean Water Act in a way that supports both environmental law and urgent national policy priorities.

Legal Authority and Discretion under the Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act empowers EPA to establish technology based effluent limitations that reflect the “best available” pollution control technologies for industries that discharge into waters of the U.S. However, the statute also provides the Administrator with discretion to determine whether such revisions are “appropriate,” a critical word in CWA § 304(b). The law expressly requires EPA to consider not only technological feasibility and cost, but also “such other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.”

Here, EPA reviewed over 5,000 public comments,4,369 mailed submissions and 810 posted electronically, including comments we assisted poultry industry clients in preparing, before determining that revisions to existing regulatory effluent limitations guidelines were not warranted. The decision reflects both statutory compliance and sound administrative judgment. Courts have consistently affirmed that when Congress uses discretionary terms like “appropriate,” agencies have leeway to weigh competing policy concerns, including economic stability, food security, making Americans’ diet healthy again, and unintended environmental tradeoffs.

Why the Withdrawal Matters

The agricultural and farm sector, and in particular the poultry sector on the Delmarva Peninsula, plays an indispensable role in the nation’s food supply. From a legal and policy perspective, EPA’s withdrawal is significant for several reasons:

Protecting the Food Supply: The poultry and meat industries are essential to national food security. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing avian flu outbreaks, and supply chain disruptions, EPA recognized that layering new effluent regulations onto this already stressed sector could destabilize production at a time when MAHA has federal agencies working with farmers to ensure the U.S. food supply is healthy, abundant, and affordable, while addressing concerns about pesticides and farming practices.

Inflation and Consumer Prices: Between 2020 and 2024, the nation endured sustained inflation, with food prices among the most sensitive indicators. EPA’s decision explicitly acknowledges that additional regulatory costs would translate into higher prices for consumers at a time when federal policy is prioritizing affordability. This alignment of environmental discretion with economic policy is both lawful and pragmatic.

Avoiding Negative Environmental Tradeoffs: EPA’s analysis revealed that several of the proposed regulatory options would actually worsen environmental and public health outcomes. Tighter water discharge standards would have forced facilities to switch to alternative waste management techniques, such as increased landfilling (e.g., the spread of PFAS through the spreading of sewerage sludge [biosolids] as fertilizer) or incineration, leading to higher air emissions (e.g., where the buildup of nutrients on land releases ammonia into the air) and solid waste burdens. By choosing the “no rule” option, EPA avoided these unintended consequences, a reminder that environmental protection is not always achieved through additional regulation.

Efficient Use of Resources: Agencies must continually prioritize limited resources. Here, EPA made a judgment that its time, staff, and funding should be directed toward initiatives with clearer environmental and human health benefits as well as to Make America Healthy Again. This decision underscores the principle of regulatory triage: focusing on areas where rules will have the greatest positive impact.

Implications for the Delmarva Poultry Industry

For the Delmarva region, home to one of the largest concentrations of poultry production in the country, this withdrawal is a major development. The industry not only supplies Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia, but much of the East Coast with affordable protein but also supports tens of thousands of jobs across farming, processing, transportation, and retail. Had EPA finalized stricter effluent limits, facilities would have faced significant compliance costs at a time when margins are already under pressure from avian flu losses, rising input prices, and labor shortages.

The Agency’s recognition that new standards could compromise the sector’s viability reflects a sophisticated understanding of the interplay between environmental regulation and regional economic health. In effect, EPA is acknowledging that environmental stewardship must coexist with food security, Make America Healthy Again, and rural economic stability.

A Responsible Exercise of Discretion

Critics may argue that this withdrawal represents a step back from water quality protection. But that view ignores two crucial facts:

First, existing effluent limits for the industry remain in place, meaning facilities must continue to comply with established wastewater discharge limits. This is not deregulation; it is a decision not to impose additional Biden era new requirements that the Agency deemed inappropriate at this time.

Second, EPA’s analysis demonstrated that the proposed revisions risked creating greater net harm through secondary pollution impacts. By choosing not to finalize the rule, EPA prevented these negative tradeoffs, a result fully consistent with its statutory mandate to protect human health and the environment.

Conclusion

The EPA’s withdrawal of the proposed Meat and Poultry Products Effluent Limit Revisions is a textbook example of an agency exercising its discretion under the Clean Water Act responsibly and with due consideration of the national interest. The decision reflects a nuanced balancing of environmental protection, food security, making Americans’ diet healthy again, inflationary pressures, and the potential for unintended harms.

For stakeholders, including those in the Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia poultry industry, this action provides much needed regulatory certainty and relief at a time of profound external pressures. More broadly, it demonstrates that environmental law is not static or one dimensional; it must be applied with judgment, humility, and an eye toward the interconnected challenges of our time.

By choosing the “no rule” option here, EPA has honored both the letter and spirit of the Clean Water Act. The Agency’s action is not a retreat from environmental protection; it is a recognition that the best way to safeguard both people and the planet is through careful, evidence based prioritization.

He expects the Gravity to dominate Lucid sales the rest of the year outpacing those of its Air sedan and the company is on track to achieve another record quarter.
On August 14 the company announced the Lucid Gravity Advantage Credit program.
In addition, Lucid launched a new ad campaign last week featuring popular actor Timothee’ Chalamet titled “Driven” to promote the Gravity.
Under the deal, robotaxis will be built by Lucid on the Gravity architecture and operate on Uber’s ride-hailing platform.","As luxury electric vehicle company Lucid Motors prepares to launch its Gravity SUV in Europe, interim CEO Marc Winterhoff is bracing for a fast-approaching deadline in the United States and laying out his strategy for dealing with its after-effects.

That deadline is September 30, when $7,500 federal tax credits on the purchase of qualified EVs disappear.

“We definitely will see an impact, but we have already started to mitigate that,” Winterhoff told reporters during an online briefing last Thursday in advance of this week’s IAA Mobility in Munich, Germany.

The impending evaporation of the tax credit created a rush to showrooms sending EV sales into heady territory, moving just over 130,000 units in July—a 19.7% spike over July, 2024 and 26.4% over June, according to Cox Automotive’s July 2025 EV Market Monitor.

Shoppers grabbed used EVs in big numbers as well, snapping up 36,670 pre-owned vehicles in July, a 40% year-over-year increase.

But the party is likely to be over once the tax incentives go away and dealers are already feeling pessimistic, according to Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke who noted, “The outlook for future EV sales really comes as no surprise: Dealers have calendars too; they see the end of government-backed incentives fast approaching and are expecting a slowdown as the market adjusts to a new reality in Q4.”

For Lucid’s deep-pocketed luxury customers $7,500 might not represent a compelling reason to make a quick purchase, but sales for its Gravity SUV have been so strong the company is boosting production through what Winterhoff described as a “steep ramp up” that will continue to the end of the year.

“Our demand is very strong for the Gravity, and is actually outpacing right now, what we can produce,” Winterhoff explained. The top of the line Dream Edition is actually sold out, he revealed.

He expects the Gravity to dominate Lucid sales the rest of the year outpacing those of its Air sedan and the company is on track to achieve another record quarter.

Even with the increase Gravity output, Lucid reduced its 2025 production outlook from 20,000 to 18,000 units, the company said in its second quarter financial report.

That report revealed increasing financial strain on Lucid, showing a Q2 net loss of $855.3 million compared with a $790 million loss during the same three-month period a year ago.

Lucid is planning to create three new “tophats” or variations built on its midsize vehicle platform starting the end of next year, Winterhoff revealed while withholding any details.

He did admit, however, financing the line will eventually need bolstering, reporting, “our funding is enough to get us into the second half of next year. We plan to do the SOP (start of production) of the midsize platform end of next year and then we're ramping up from there. So that tells you that, and everybody actually would know that, that there will be additional funds needed in order to get there. But right now we are until the second half of 2026, well funded.”

On the job about six months after serving as chief operating officer for a year, Winterhoff already installed an aggressive strategy to both cool stress among customers who may feel pressure to buy before September 30 and defend against an expected slowdown in EV sales after that date.

On August 14 the company announced the Lucid Gravity Advantage Credit program. Under the program qualifying lessees who place an order for a Gravity by September 30 and lease between October 1 and December 31 will be eligible to receive a $7,500 Lucid Advantage Credit. Existing qualifying customers are covered as well.

“On top of that, we think that we are well positioned in Q4 and going forward we will obviously provide some incentives in Q4 to make it also for customers a little bit less harsh-- the difference between the with and without the credit,” said Winterhoff.

In addition, Lucid launched a new ad campaign last week featuring popular actor Timothee’ Chalamet titled “Driven” to promote the Gravity.

Looking ahead at the competitive landscape in the U.S. among EV companies, Winterhoff expressed confidence Lucid would maintain its strong position in the luxury segment, saying “right now with the Air, you know, we are in a pretty good spot. I mean, obviously we are planning to stay there. We are planning to do exactly the same with the Gravity as well. We think that we are very competitive with our products.”

Now Lucid is making its biggest move in Europe, announcing at IAA Munich it’s ready to take orders on the Gravity on the Continent.

“We will add additional markets, more than double in the next year, where we go into other European markets,” said Winterhoff. “We're not only going there with the current direct to consumer model that we have. Selected markets we will enter with importers and even in other markets we will add, let's say, dealerships that work as agents for us.”

Beyond retail, Lucid is covering its bets, having just closed a $300 million investment deal with ride hailing giant Uber Technologies Inc. Under the deal, robotaxis will be built by Lucid on the Gravity architecture and operate on Uber’s ride-hailing platform.

The first of those robotaxis is scheduled to go into service late in 2026 in a “major U.S. city,” according to the companies in a September 4 announcement.

Winterhoff is all too aware there are plenty of skeptics about the expected conversion from internal combustion engine vehicles to all- electric, admitting while sales are increasing, it’s at a slower pace than the industry had hoped.

But as he views moves by other automakers such as Ford Motor Co. that just announced it will produce lower cost EVs and upstart Slate, which promises a zero-frills EV in order to boost EV adoption, Winterhoff says Lucid will, in turn, adjust pricing down from its original $100,000-plus price point, but never go down market from its luxury perch.

“Now we are starting at 70, with the mid-size,” he explained. “The plan is to start at around 50 or slightly, slightly below. So that's the area where we where we want to play in but still in the in the premium sector. We’re fully aware that there is strong competition. There always will be but we think that we have a fantastic product and that we are able to compete in that area.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68bdd3625fa3a8c6d1814db0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-07 19:01:11.237964

Geothermal plants tap into Earth's natural heat to create electricity without burning anything. Hot water and steam from underground reservoirs spin turbines that produce power around the clock, regardless of weather conditions.

This technology offers stable electricity prices because it doesn't rely on imported fuels. Cities and businesses can budget more effectively when their power comes from consistent sources rather than fluctuating dirty fuel markets.

The Tanawon plant joins a growing network of renewable facilities helping the Philippines reach its goal of getting 35% of electricity from clean sources by 2030. Currently, renewables provide 22% of the nation's power. Coal still supplies most electricity needs.

Every megawatt of clean energy that replaces coal-fired power means fewer harmful particles in the air. Research has demonstrated that slashing air pollution leads to fewer respiratory problems, heart conditions, and other health issues in surrounding areas.

The new facility strengthens the country's energy independence while creating local jobs. EDC worked with First Balfour Inc. in the Philippines and Japan's Toshiba during construction, bringing technical expertise to the region.

Four additional renewable projects are scheduled to become operational this year, including three battery storage systems and another geothermal plant in Leyte.

These facilities will add more clean capacity to the grid while providing backup power during peak demand.

Jerome Cainglet, EDC's president and chief operating officer, called the plant's launch ""a win for the country's energy security and climate resilience journey,"" per Inquirer.net.

The company plans to complete an additional 5.6-megawatt binary geothermal facility located in Negros Occidental by 2026.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gLrmxAp_eqXzQMSdY3TU3A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/2b97a5bd091720ec69df7975c6800e5f,N,,2025-09-07 20:58:30.302416

In New York, according to data from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, it already employs 180,000 people, with buildings and transportation adding the most recent jobs.
More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy.
While federal policies may do their best to place stumbling blocks in the way, this is New York’s energy future.
Such a bill was passed by the New York State Legislature this year and Gov.","New York’s ambitious climate goals are facing a blizzard of political headwinds. Federal tax credits and funding for green energy projects are disappearing. Fossil fuel companies have spent millions on lobbying efforts to slow down legislation that would forward the state’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act’s electrification policy. Those efforts seem to be bearing fruit.

This opposition should not deter New York from striving to meet its goals – whether a few years late or not. In the grand scheme of things, the pushback against clean energy is a sadly misinformed blip.

In a recent editorial, the Buffalo News urged the state’s leadership to redouble its efforts in addressing climate change, fully implementing …

Despite a seeming powerhouse of opposition, much of it coming directly from the White House, the clean energy business continues to make strides. Why? It’s simple. The industry makes strong economic sense. In New York, according to data from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, it already employs 180,000 people, with buildings and transportation adding the most recent jobs.

The Buffalo News editorial board recently accused New York of “lagging” in its climate goals, urging state leaders not to “lose their will.” B…

NYSERDA further states that large-scale renewable projects now in the pipeline will add thousands more jobs, as well as spur more than $4.7 billion in private investment. Utility-scale solar and wind are cheaper than fossil fuels, with other technologies quickly becoming more cost competitive. More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy.

While federal policies may do their best to place stumbling blocks in the way, this is New York’s energy future. State leaders must do their best to mitigate funding losses, fight fear-mongering misinformation and continue to steer the ship. Other states – including Colorado, California and Massachusetts – are facing the same headwinds and are still making progress.

In a recent Editorial Board meeting with NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen Harris and staff members, Harris made it clear that her organization was mission-driven toward that clean energy future.

In an Aug. 17 op-ed for The News, Harris – with Rory Christian, chair of the New York State Public Service Commission – wrote, “New York remains a national leader in renewable energy. The state is home to the country’s only operational utility-scale offshore wind farm, with two more projects moving forward. We reached our 2025 distributed solar goal a full year ahead of schedule, and for two years running we’ve led the nation in community solar deployment.”

These are encouraging words. But it is not encouraging, as stated in New York’s 2025 draft energy plan, that redeploying fossil fuel systems is part of a revised strategy.

Weaning the state off fossil fuels, not adding them back, was the original idea and it still makes sense. New York’s extensive natural gas system releases methane – a potent greenhouse gas – and other harmful chemicals through leaks, especially within low-income neighborhoods, disproportionately affecting Black, Indigenous and people of color. This is especially true in cities like Buffalo, which, like all of New York’s urban centers, is dominated by older housing stock.

Organizations like PUSH Buffalo are working toward state policies that will bring clean energy into the neighborhoods that suffer the most from pollution – both indoors and out. One such policy, eliminating the “100 foot rule” that requires ratepayers to subsidize new gas hookups would help eliminate a financial burden as well as ease the way to a clean energy transition. Such a bill was passed by the New York State Legislature this year and Gov. Kathy Hochul should sign it.

The state should also continue on a path of neighborhood-focused action, like the installation of thermal energy networks and making older buildings more energy-efficient. This work, which helps ordinary people take advantage of healthier energy technology, is just as important as building wind farms and adding more gigawatts to New York’s solar arsenal.

Finally, though preliminary work has advanced the possible implementation of a Cap-and-Invest program that would allow emitters to purchase allowances, this timeline needs to be speeded up. It’s an essential part of funding New York’s transition.

The Vice President recently spent time in Scotland, reportedly using part of his holiday to hold behind closed doors meetings with senior executives from some of the US' largest nuclear energy firms, including Westinghouse, GE Hitachi, X-energy, Holtec International, and TerraPower, the Bill Gates-backed startup.

Though the discussions were officially described as exploratory, sources close to the matter say they lasted nearly twice as long as planned and centered on real-world opportunities for US firms to help meet Britain’s growing energy needs, particularly those driven by the boom in artificial intelligence and data centre expansion. With Trump soon expected to land in the UK for his second state visit taking place from 17 to 19 September, the White House is said to be pushing hard to secure UK government backing for major nuclear infrastructure projects.

Among the headline proposals are a large-scale plant on the island of Anglesey in North Wales, led by Westinghouse, and a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) planned by X-energy, which aims to deploy them in industrial areas across the UK, The Telegraph reported.

Days before Trump's visit to the UK, Lord Mandelson, Britain’s ambassador to the US, called for a ""generational evolution"" of the transatlantic alliance, underpinned by new partnerships in energy, AI, and defence.

Speaking at the Ditchley Annual Lecture on September 6, he said: ""President Trump’s second state visit will showcase the best of British traditions and ceremony, but at its core will be new agreements that write the next chapter of transatlantic success; to create jobs, drive innovation, and ensure that British and American ingenuity continues to lead the world.""

He added: ""The Atlantic alliance has prevailed in every great contest of the modern era. Today’s technological competition will be no different, but we must act with the urgency and unity this moment demands.""

Typically, US presidents serving a second term are not invited for full state visits, but this visit comes following a personal invitation from King Charles III, delivered by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer during trade discussions at the White House earlier this year.

Trump, who previously visited in 2019 at the invitation of the late Queen Elizabeth II, described the renewed invitation as a ""great, great honour.""

He will be joined by First Lady Melania Trump and hosted at Windsor Castle, as Buckingham Palace remains under renovation.

The UK government itself has begun streamlining nuclear development. In early 2025, reforms were announced to allow small modular reactors more widely across England and Wales by reducing red tape.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said back in February: ""This country hasn’t built a nuclear power station in decades. We’ve been let down, and left behind. Our energy security has been hostage to Putin for too long, with British prices skyrocketing at his whims.

GM, for instance, has cut its electric-vehicle production plans at two factories and is overhauling a third plant to make gas-fueled pickups instead of battery-powered trucks. Similarly, Ford is moving funds from a canceled three-row electric SUV to future internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids. Stellantis NV is reviving the thirsty Hemi V-8 engine [2].

The shift in policy is expected to save Ford billions in regulatory credits, which it plans to reallocate to gas-powered models and hybrids. Ford's Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley recently told analysts that the policy change has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years [2].

GM has spent $3.5 billion since 2022 purchasing regulatory credits to meet fuel economy and tailpipe emissions requirements. With the rollback, these credits may become less needed, saving GM money. GM's Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson expects the company to save money in 2026 and beyond due to the elimination of fines faced by automakers that fell short of fuel-economy mandates [2].

The US Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rescinding of stringent tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions rules further supports this shift. The EPA's decision and the president's signature on legislation terminating similar regulations set by California are expected to benefit Detroit's automakers significantly [2].

However, the rollback is not without criticism. Environmental advocates argue that the policy change is detrimental to efforts to curb pollution from automobiles, one of the largest contributors to planet-warming emissions. Under President Biden, the EPA's rules were expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 7 billion metric tons over the life of the program and save drivers about $6,000 in fuel and maintenance costs [2].

Despite the criticism, automakers like GM believe they can capture a bigger slice of the EV market as rivals pull out, but they are happy to do so at a slower rate. GM is operating on just one shift of workers at some factories to build electric vehicles, reflecting the slower demand for EVs [2].

The deregulatory push also includes an aggressive tariff policy that penalizes imported vehicles and parts, imposing steep costs on carmakers. Ford's $1.5 billion savings on credits so far this year nearly offsets the $2 billion net hit to profits it expects to take from tariffs for all of 2025. GM expects about $3 billion in annual costs from tariffs, far more than the roughly $730 million average it has spent on compliance each year since 2022 [2].

In contrast, EV makers like Rivian Automotive Inc. and Tesla Inc. stand to lose significant revenue from the policy changes. Tesla has raked more than $10 billion by selling credits to other automakers since 2020, including more than $1 billion so far this year. Rivian CFO Claire McDonough expects zero revenue from credit sales for the rest of the year as a result of the policy changes [2].

Although not yet finalized, the deregulatory push is clearing the way for Detroit’s legacy automakers and their traditional rivals to reallocate billions of dollars earmarked for EVs and other costs linked to pollution rules. GM has spent $3.5 billion since 2022 purchasing so-called regulatory credits to help the company meet fuel economy and tailpipe emissions requirements – a less-needed currency if Trump’s policies stick.

Ford has similarly cut its own credit-purchase commitments by nearly $1.5 billion this year alone, money it now plans to reallocate to gas-powered models and hybrids.

The shift in policy “has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years,” Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley recently told analysts.

Trump’s $3.4 trillion fiscal package sunsets the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers on Sept. 30. It also zeroed out fines faced by automakers that fell short of fuel-economy mandates, negating the need to buy credits under those rules. Stellantis paid $190 million in penalties in each of the last two years.

Eliminating the fines “will save us money in 2026 and beyond for sure,” GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told investors last month.

Separately, the US Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rescinding stringent rules limiting tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions from cars and the president signed legislation effectively terminating similar regulations set by California.

Conclusion The Trump-era emissions rollback provided Detroit’s legacy automakers with a strategic reprieve, enabling them to prioritize ICE profitability and reallocate capital away from costly electrification initiatives.","The Trump administration’s sweeping emissions rollback (2017–2021) reshaped the U.S. auto industry’s strategic calculus, enabling Detroit’s legacy automakers to prioritize internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles over costly electrification initiatives. By freezing fuel economy standards at 2020 levels through model year 2026 and weakening greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations, the administration created a regulatory environment that directly incentivized capital reallocation toward ICE production. This shift, while controversial, has yielded measurable financial gains for General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, offering critical insights for investors navigating the sector’s evolving landscape.

Regulatory Reprieve and Strategic Reorientation

The Trump-era policy framework, epitomized by the 2018 “Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule,” effectively suspended the Obama-era mandate for annual improvements in fuel efficiency. By pegging standards to 2020 levels, the administration reduced compliance costs for automakers, particularly for large SUVs and trucks—vehicles that historically generate the highest profit margins. According to a report by the Harvard Environmental Law Program, this move “freed automakers from the need to invest in costly technologies to meet stricter targets,” allowing them to redirect capital toward ICE platforms [1].

For Detroit’s Big Three, this regulatory flexibility translated into a strategic reorientation. General Motors, for instance, scaled back its EV R&D budget in 2019, shifting focus to mid-size trucks and SUVs, which accounted for over 60% of its U.S. sales by 2020 [2]. Similarly, Ford’s decision to discontinue the low-selling Fusion sedan in 2021—replacing it with a new Bronco SUV—was framed as a response to “consumer demand and regulatory clarity” under the Trump rules [3]. Stellantis, then Fiat-Chrysler, similarly prioritized ICE models, with CEO Jim Ackerman noting in 2020 that the company’s “profitability hinges on large, fuel-efficient ICE vehicles in a less regulated environment” [4].

ICE Profitability Metrics and Capital Reallocation

The financial impact of this shift is evident in the automakers’ earnings reports. Ford’s F-150 pickup, a gas-powered model, generated a 20% operating margin in 2020—nearly double the industry average for EVs [5]. GM’s Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, both ICE-based, contributed $3.2 billion in pre-tax profits in 2019, a 15% increase from 2017 [6]. These figures underscore the profitability of ICE vehicles under relaxed regulations, even as automakers publicly committed to electrification goals.

Capital reallocation further amplified these gains. Between 2017 and 2021, Detroit’s Big Three reduced combined EV R&D spending by 18%, reallocating $4.3 billion to ICE production lines and plant upgrades [7]. For example, Ford’s $7.2 billion investment in its Blue Oval City plant in Tennessee (announced in 2021) was initially earmarked for EVs but was partially redirected to expand F-150 production capacity [8]. Stellantis similarly repurposed a $1.5 billion facility in Michigan to focus on Ram trucks, citing “regulatory certainty and consumer preference for ICE vehicles” as key drivers [9].

Risks and Long-Term Considerations

While the Trump-era policies bolstered short-term ICE profitability, they also delayed critical investments in electrification. A 2021 analysis by BloombergNEF noted that Detroit’s Big Three lagged behind Tesla and European rivals in EV battery production capacity, a gap that widened during the Trump years [10]. Additionally, the administration’s 2025 auto tariffs—imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act—introduced new headwinds, with the Detroit Three facing an estimated $108 billion in combined costs by 2025 [11]. These tariffs, coupled with the Biden administration’s subsequent reversal of Trump-era emissions rules, have created regulatory volatility that complicates long-term planning.

Strategic Implications for Investors

For investors, the interplay between regulatory shifts and capital allocation highlights the importance of hedging against policy uncertainty. Detroit’s legacy automakers have demonstrated resilience by leveraging ICE profitability to fund future electrification efforts, but their reliance on a deregulated environment remains a double-edged sword. As the Biden administration tightens emissions standards and states like California enforce zero-emission vehicle mandates, the window for ICE dominance may narrow.

Conclusion

The Trump-era emissions rollback provided Detroit’s legacy automakers with a strategic reprieve, enabling them to prioritize ICE profitability and reallocate capital away from costly electrification initiatives. While this approach delivered short-term gains, it also exposed the industry to regulatory and market risks. For investors, the key takeaway is clear: the auto sector’s future hinges on balancing ICE resilience with agile adaptation to evolving policy landscapes.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 19:02:01.004918

Advantages of Electric Cars

Electric vehicles offer significant benefits for drivers beyond just lower prices. The advantages range from saving money over time to helping reduce pollution in our communities.

Cost Efficiency

Electric cars tend to be more budget-friendly for day-to-day driving compared to gas vehicles. This is primarily due to their superior efficiency and lower energy costs.

While the purchase price of EVs is typically higher than similar conventional vehicles, this gap is narrowing. Many manufacturers have been cutting EV prices in recent years, making them more accessible.

The long-term savings are substantial. EVs have:

Lower fuel costs (electricity vs. gasoline)

Reduced maintenance expenses (fewer moving parts)

No oil changes required

Less brake wear due to regenerative braking

In most cases, an EV will cost less over its lifetime despite the higher upfront cost. Federal tax incentives and rebates further improve the financial equation for many buyers.

Environmental Benefits

Electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, which helps improve local air quality. This direct reduction in pollution is especially important in urban areas where traffic congestion contributes to smog and health issues.

The overall environmental impact depends on how electricity is generated in a region. Areas with cleaner power grids (more renewables, less coal) see greater benefits from EV adoption.

EVs are becoming increasingly cleaner as:

Power grids add more renewable energy sources

Battery production becomes more efficient

Battery recycling improves

The reduced noise pollution is another advantage. Electric motors operate much more quietly than internal combustion engines, creating less noise in neighborhoods and cities.

Even when considering manufacturing impacts and electricity sources, most EVs have a lower lifetime carbon footprint than comparable gas vehicles.

Key Features to Consider

When shopping for a budget-friendly electric vehicle, certain features can make a big difference in your ownership experience. Understanding what matters most will help you find an EV that fits your needs without breaking the bank.

Battery Life and Range

Range anxiety remains one of the top concerns for potential EV buyers. Most affordable electric cars now offer between 100-250 miles of range per charge, which is sufficient for daily commuting and occasional longer trips.

The Niro EV offers decent range while maintaining a relatively lower price point compared to premium models. When evaluating battery performance, look beyond just the maximum range number.

Consider these important battery factors:

Degradation rate – how quickly the battery loses capacity over time

Temperature performance – how extreme cold or heat affects range

Warranty coverage – most manufacturers offer 8-10 year battery warranties

Battery chemistry – newer LFP batteries often last longer than older technologies

Real-world range often differs from EPA estimates. Cold weather, highway speeds, and using climate control can reduce range by 20-40%.

Safety Features

Even budget EVs should include essential safety systems. Many affordable electric vehicles come with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that were once found only in luxury models.

Basic features like A/C and GPS are expected, but safety should be prioritized when selecting budget-friendly electric cars. Look for these key safety elements:

Automatic emergency braking

Lane keeping assistance

Blind spot monitoring

Multiple airbags

High crash test ratings

Many EVs have inherent safety advantages due to their design. The low center of gravity from floor-mounted batteries improves stability, while the absence of a traditional engine creates larger crumple zones.

Charging Infrastructure

Access to convenient charging is crucial for daily EV use. Before purchasing, evaluate your charging options at home and on regular travel routes.

Home charging provides significant cost benefits, allowing you to power up overnight when electricity rates are often lower. Consider these charging considerations:

Home charging options:

Level 1 (120V): 3-5 miles of range per hour

Level 2 (240V): 15-35 miles of range per hour

Public charging access:

DC Fast Chargers: 80% charge in 30-60 minutes

Network compatibility with your vehicle

Charging speeds your vehicle supports

Most affordable EVs now offer fast-charging capability, but charging speeds vary significantly between models. Check if your vehicle includes a heat pump, which improves efficiency in cold weather.

Why Is An EV Road User Charge Being Pursued?
An option that seems to have significant support, even among some EV advocacy organisations, is a universal road user charge based on vehicle mass1 × distance travelled.
For example, the Australian Electric Vehicle Association (AEVA) is supportive of a road user charge.
AEVA National President Dr Chris Jones said that even under a universal road user charge, Australia’s fuel excise2 should remain in place.","Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers met with his state/territory counterparts on Friday to discuss (among other things) a potential road user charge (RUC) for electric vehicles.

What Was The Outcome Of The Meeting?

An options paper was put together for the meeting, a goal of which was for state and territory treasurers to “agree or to discuss some principles behind this policy design”.

What was in that paper isn’t clear. But the treasurers were in general agreement about the need for reforms to road user charging arrangements for electric vehicles, and that those reforms should be designed not to impede EV uptake.

“The reforms to the treatment of electric vehicles will ensure more equitable treatment across vehicle types and provide certainty to support investment,” says a (brief) joint statement from the meeting. “The design of reforms should be as simple as possible and minimise administration and compliance burden. We will ensure any changes are phased to enable the productivity, climate and consumer benefits of increasing electric vehicle uptake over the coming years.”

In a separate summary of the meeting, which also identified the need for reduction or removal of regulations that disadvantage electric heavy vehicles, Treasurer Chalmers said:

“The Commonwealth will progress work with the states and territories and take the time to get the policy development right.”

So, it appears this will still be a ‘Pantene’ process – it won’t happen overnight, but it will happen.

Why Is An EV Road User Charge Being Pursued?

EV owners avoid paying fuel excise and plug-in hybrid owners only pay it when they top-up at the pump. Fuel excise helps pay for road projects and maintenance — sort of. Collected by the federal government, fuel excise goes into general/consolidated revenue; where it can be spent on just about anything.

“Universal” RUC Missing In Action

The seismic shift that will be brought about by electric vehicles also means a seismic shift is needed in how we fund roads. An option that seems to have significant support, even among some EV advocacy organisations, is a universal road user charge based on vehicle mass1 × distance travelled.

For example, the Australian Electric Vehicle Association (AEVA) is supportive of a road user charge.

“… but only if it’s part of a wider reform of road-related revenue collection which applies to all vehicles regardless of their fuel source. This is particularly relevant as conventional hybrids are primarily responsible for the decline in fuel excise collected form [sic] petrol sales, yet such vehicles would not be captured under an EV-specific RUC.”

However, based on the Friday meeting statement, it doesn’t appear a universal RUC approach is being considered (yet).

What About The Fuel Excise’s Future?

AEVA National President Dr Chris Jones said that even under a universal road user charge, Australia’s fuel excise2 should remain in place.

“An EV and a diesel vehicle of identical weight and annual mileage should pay the same sum for use of the roads,” he said. “But the diesel vehicle should pay something extra for the noise, harmful pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Fortunately, fuel excise captures that perfectly already.”

And the AEVA says while the RUC should be set by the federal government, state and territory transport departments should administer the scheme and retain all revenue for road maintenance.

The Federal Treasurer reportedly isn’t keen on a universal road user charge *and* fuel excise existing side-by-side as he considers this a double-tap tax for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle owners. But that’s the point: a “polluter pays” approach would make ICE ownership less desirable; although there are significant social and other implications to consider.",https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/chalmers-ev-ruc.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 17:00:33.381209

""I will study the plan and decide accordingly in this week,"" he said. Currently, PMPML operates a fleet of 490 electric buses. However, concerns are rising — not just over silent operations, but also mechanical reliability. ""The buses are risky,"" said commuter Ashwin Lande. ""They just zoom past without warning. Many new EV models include some form of audible alert now. PMPML should consider something similar."" Another commuter, Pankaj Khot of Kondhwa, echoed the concerns. ""These buses often speed in heavy traffic and even break signals at night. If there's a system to alert people, it should be implemented immediately,"" he said. PMPML spokesperson Kishore Chauhan said drivers have been instructed to honk frequently, especially while overtaking. ""The buses are operated by private contractors. We'll investigate the complaints,"" he added. (With inputs from Shashank Didmishe)

Audi moves forward by looking back

The Audi Concept C previews what a future electric sports car from the automaker could look like, but its design is firmly rooted in the past. Audi claims inspiration from throughout its history, ranging from the 1936 Auto Union Type C race car that served as a Nazi propaganda tool, to the third-generation 2004 Audi A6 sedan that has served as the brand’s styling template for the past 20 years.

The Concept C’s long hood and hunchback rear give it a similar silhouette to the Type C. The 1930s race car had its engine behind the driver, but it’s unclear what this all-electric concept car is hiding under that vented rear cowl. The Millennial influence is also apparent in the minimalist, unadorned surfaces. Like a mid-2000s Apple product, the Concept C looks like it was hewn from a solid chunk of metal. The minimalist theme continues inside, where a 10.4-inch display screen folds away when not in use so as not to ruin the clean lines of the dashboard. Physical controls are well integrated and made from anodized aluminum for a quality feel, while indirect ambient lighting “enhances the interior design’s evident solidity,” according to Audi.

This concept’s main purpose is to show off the next evolution of Audi design, so technical details weren’t disclosed. Audi did say that the Concept C previews a future production model, which could be paired with the expected EV replacements for the Porsche 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman sports cars.

BMW goes back to school

BMW unveiled the first of its next-generation “Neue Klasse” EVs at its hometown show, and SUV called the iX3 that’s close in size to the automaker’s current bestseller — the gasoline X3. Named after a family of models that helped save the company in the 1960s and 1970s, the Neue Klasse (German for “new class”) is a complete EV rethink for BMW.

In iX3 50 xDrive launch guise, this electric SUV will have a pair of motors generating 463 horsepower and 476 pound-feet of torque, getting it from zero to 60 mph in a BMW-estimated 4.7 seconds. For this dual-motor powertrain, BMW opted for a front asynchronous motor and rear electrically exited synchronous motor for what the automaker claims is improved efficiency. The battery pack is made up of cylindrical cells assembled without modules (known as cell-to-pack), while the pack itself is more closely integrated with the vehicle structure.

The new cells improve energy density by 20%, crucial for hitting BMW’s targeted 400 miles of range. BMW also claims a 30% improvement in charging speed compared to its current-generation EVs, allowing the iX3 to recover 230 miles of range in 10 minutes when DC fast charging at its full 400-kilowatt capacity. The iX3 marks BMW’s switch to the North American Charging Standard (NACS), but a free Combined Charging Standard (CCS) adapter will be provided.

The Neue Klasse models also have a streamlined electrical architecture based around four “superbrain” computers, which reduces the weight of these components by 30% and eliminates 2,000 feet of wiring, BMW claims. One of the four computers, called the “Heart of Joy” will integrate powertrain and chassis functions for better driving dynamics, while another will handle driver aids, including a “symbiotic” mode that blends manual and automated control inputs.

The iX3 itself features fresh styling, with a thin vertical grille that harkens back to this EV’s Neue Klasse namesakes from the 1960s. Inside, a dashboard-spanning display, next-generation head-up display, and voice assistant are included. The iX3 is scheduled to reach the United States in summer 2026, with prices starting around $60,000.

Mercedes’ star shines even brighter

In contrast to BMW, Mercedes-Benz is moving away from dedicated EVs and focusing on electric versions of combustion models. That strategy has already rolled out with the electric G-Class SUV and CLA-Class compact, and continues with an electric version of the GLC-Class SUV that could be one of the BMW iX3’s closest rivals.

Officially the GLC with EQ Technology, the EV looks a lot like a gasoline GLC, but with bigger, illuminated grille and the Mercedes-star headlights from the CLA. However, the electric version also has a 3.3-inch longer wheelbase that increases headroom and legroom in both rows of seats, plus a 4.5-cubic-foot frunk.

Full specs will be released closer to the electric GLC’s arrival in the U.S. late next year, but Mercedes estimates up to 483 hp and 443 miles of range from a 94-kilowatt-hour battery pack using new cell chemistry. An 800-volt electrical architecture allows for even faster DC fast charging, with the ability to recover up to 188 miles of range in 10 minutes, according to Mercedes. A “One-Box” braking system integrates the friction and regenerative braking for better feel, while available rear-axle steering and air suspension should improve agility and comfort, respectively.

Inside, you’ll find a panoramic glass roof with switchable electrochromic glass to block out excessive rays, and a 39.1-inch dashboard display comprised of a 10.25-inch instrument cluster, 14-inch central touchscreen, and 14-inch front-passenger touchscreen. It runs the new Mercedes-Benz Operating System (MB.OS) and Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment software that debuted in the CLA, with a cacophony of voice assistants. ChatGPT4o with Bing search and Google Cloud’s Automotive AI Agent are both onboard, along with Mercedes’ own virtual assistant.

Porsche lets you charge a car like a smartphone

Porsche’s biggest announcement was a new generation of 911 Turbo that adds a hybrid powertrain to the legendary sports car. But Porsche also had some news for those who disdain cars without plugs, announcing that the upcoming Cayenne Electric will be available with wireless charging — a much-discussed EV feature that’s failed to gain traction with automakers until now.

Instead of having to drag cables around, drivers will be able to simply park the Cayenne Electric over a wireless charging pad, which will transmit electricity to a receiver mounted on the underside of the vehicle between the front wheels. Porsche claims this system will be able to transmit power at 11 kW — about the same as many conventional onboard AC chargers — over a gap of four to six inches. Charging will start automatically once the car is in position, and a special camera view will help drivers to do that. Porsche also promises similar features to conventional charging, including cabin preconditioning, departure scheduling, and integration with the My Porsche app.

Several aftermarket companies offer wireless-charging hardware that can be retrofitted to EVs, but that doesn’t offer the seamless integration of a system available from the factory. But aside from some Chinese-market vehicles and South Korean-market versions of the Genesis GV60, such integration isn’t available. Porsche could be the first automaker to offer wireless charging at scale, across multiple markets. It plans to launch the system in Europe in 2026, followed by “other markets around the world.”",https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pre-media_25c0192_101.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1,N,,2025-09-07 18:00:54.721590

You need something equally as wild as the AMG GT XX to flow a whole ass megawatt of power into a car.","Mercedes-Benz is on a mission to change the electric vehicle world with its AMG GT XX concept. It already has 25 different world records under its belt, but the feat it just achieved might be the most impressive so far: The GT XX can accomplish 1 megawatt charging with just a single cable. At a prototype charging station, the concept vehicle achieved over 1,000 kilowatts (that equals 1 megawatt) of charging power thanks to its axial flux motors and direct-cooled battery. These two pieces of tech aren't just some far-off idea, either — they're expected to reach series production with the production version of the GT XX that will debut next year riding on the AMG.EA high-performance EV architecture.

The car was able to achieve a maximum charging speed of 1,041 kW during megawatt charging. Mercedes says the power was available just 0.5 seconds after charging started, and it was able to maintain at least 1,000 kW for about two and a half minutes. Up to 1,176 amps of current was able to flow through a specially designed CCS charging cable, transmitting 17.3 kWh of juice in just one minute. That's the equivalent of 78 miles of range in the WLTP cycle. In EPA terms, that's at least 55 to 60 miles, which is pretty incredible.

Mercedes says a lot of what makes these sorts of ludicrous charging speeds possible is the design of the 3,000 battery cells inside the AMG GT XX that were developed in-house in Affalterbach and inspired by Formula 1 tech. They make use of cylindrical NCMA cells that have a tall, slim design that allows for efficient cooling and high energy density. Their laser-welded aluminum cell housing also improves conductivity when it comes to both current and heat, meaning they can charge faster for longer.

The company put a lot of thought into the AMG GT XX's cooling system and its ability to dissipate heat quickly enough to support these sorts of nutty charging speeds (let alone support the kind of power the car produces). Intelligent thermal management is pinpoint accurate when it comes to controlling the pack's temperature to make sure everything is performing at tip-top shape — even during intensive use.

Of course, you can't pop over to your run-of-the-mill Tesla Supercharger or Electrify America hub and get these sorts of numbers. You need something equally as wild as the AMG GT XX to flow a whole ass megawatt of power into a car. That's why Mercedes teamed up with European charging company Alpitronic to come up with something more extreme. The station used for this test was apparently originally designed for commercial trucks, but it was converted into a system that worked with smaller CCS cables.

Don't worry, that isn't some one-off experiment, either. Mercedes and Alpitronic say their findings will relate directly to the development of new high-performance chargers in both Europe and North America. Folks, we're getting dangerously close to the moment when EVs can fill up just as fast as gas-powered cars. What will electric vehicle doomers say then? In any case, what a cool world we're living in, isn't it?",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/mercedes-amg-gt-xx-concept-charges-at-1-megawatt-basically-as-fast-as-filling-up-a-gas-powered-car/l-intro-1757255065.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:53.176062

The good news is that the $7,500 federal credit isn't the only available incentive.","You've probably read by now that the $7,500 tax credits for buying an EV are going away at the end of September. To be clear, this isn't a restructuring of the EV credits, they're not just changing which cars are eligible for the full amount. President Trump is simply taking the federal EV credits off the table entirely.

We were able to get some insight on the matter from John Vincent, Senior Editor/Vehicle Testing for U.S. News & World Report, who had the following to say: “Automakers are steadily building their lineups of EVs and will still have electric cars to sell after September 30. I’d look for them to substantially drop prices or offer incentives, though they might not make up for the entire loss of the federal tax credit. I think the best bet if you’re a shopper: Buy now to ensure your access to the savings. So there you have it, if you were waiting for an excuse to buy an EV, this is one of the best you're ever going to get, and here's why we think the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is the right choice.

Why The Hyundai Ioniq 5?

In our latest roundup of new 2025 EVs, we put the Hyundai Ioniq 5 right at the top of the list, above some stellar vehicles like the BMW iX, the Audi Q8 e-Tron, and even the Porsche Taycan.

To take a quick look at the specs...

These numbers are all over the place, because Hyundai really does have an Ioniq 5 for every price range. The Ioniq 5 SE Standard Range is a 168-horse rear-wheel drive model that will start you out at $42,600, or just $35,100 if you qualify for the full $7,500 EV credit. Move your way up the ladder, and you've got the 225-hp $49,600 SEL, with 318 miles of all-electric range in the rear-wheel drive model, and the $54,300 320-hp all-wheel drive Limited, with an electric range of 269 miles.

A Surprisingly Potent Family SUV

Whatever you're after, there's an Ioniq 5 to suit your needs at a price you can live with. But, we wouldn't be recommending it if we didn't actually like it. The all-wheel drive models are capable of 0-60 times in the five-second range, and the athletic powertrain and responsive handling make for a family car that's actually fun to drive.

If you were to ask us to nitpick the Ioniq 5: the steering feedback is definitely a bit numb, and the suspension is cushy to the point of being almost floaty. It's not the most driver-oriented car, but that's not really what you're after in a mid-range family SUV.

The EV Credits Don't Just Apply To Leased Models

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 has been on and off the list of cars eligible for the EV credit. Right now, Hyundai lists the following Ioniq models as qualifying for the full $7,500.

2025 Ioniq 5 SE Standard Range with model code 1402REZ

2025 Ioniq 5 SE All-Wheel Drive with model code 51412AEZ

2025 Ioniq 5 Limited Rear-Wheel Drive with model code 51462REZ

2025 Ioniq 5 XRT with model code 51452AEZ

2025 Ioniq 5 XRT All-Wheel Drive with tow hitch with model code 514C2AEZ

2026 Ioniq 9 (all trims, powertrains and model codes)

At present, Hyundai lists these models as being eligible for the full $7,500 EV credit for purchase. To quote the website directly...

Eligible customers who purchase a new 2026 IONIQ 9 or a select new 2025 IONIQ 5 vehicle from a participating, IRS-registered dealer may qualify for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500. The tax credit may be applied at point of sale or applied against customer’s annual income tax liability.

The 2026 Ioniq 9 is currently the only 2026 model eligible for the EV credit, and the list doesn't include a single 2024 model. So if you want an Ioniq 5, you're looking for a 2025 model in particular. The good news is that almost every configuration is covered, so you should be able to claim the credit no matter what you're after.

Supplies Are Limited

You'll want to move fast, not just because the credits are disappearing, but because EVs are flying off the lots right now. Checking in with U.S. News & World Report's John Vincent once more, the Senior Editor told us:

“Demand for new cars has been artificially boosted for the last several months, first with shoppers trying to beat the Trump import taxes, and now by the expiring federal EV tax credit. Unless automakers juice the market with generous incentives, the fourth quarter could see significant weakness.”

Time Is Literally Running Out

Let's say you're waiting for that Christmas bonus from work before you decide to take the plunge on an EV, or you'd rather drive a 2026 model. Whatever the case, you're not buying until October, at the earliest, which means that you're going to miss out on the $7,500 credit... What then?

State-Level Incentives Remain, But Are Unlikely To Match The Federal EV Credit Dollar-For-Dollar

The bad news is that this is it for the full $7,500 federal EV credit. If it's ever coming back, it's unlikely to be anytime in the next three and a half years. The good news is that the $7,500 federal credit isn't the only available incentive. In fact, California has promised to match the $7,500 amount at a state-level to make up the difference. Drivers in other states, though, might have to settle for what they can get. According to John Vincent...

Many states already have incentive programs for EV buyers, but $7,500 per vehicle is a lot for a state to offer. The high-tax economic powerhouse of California may be able to fund such a program, but I doubt many other states can. Oregon, for example, a state politically similar to California, offers up to a $5,000 rebate toward the purchase of an EV. However, Oregon’s EV rebate funding consistently runs out early in the year, and even it can’t muster the political will to extend the program.”

There are simply too many obstacles in the way of state-level EV credits matching the outgoing federal credit. States that have the political support might not have the money for such incentives, and states that have the money might not have the political support.

Between state-level EV incentives and dealer mark-downs to make up for sales lost to the expiring EV credits, it's not impossible to think that you might wind up cobbling together a total discount roughly equal to the $7,500 federal credit. But you can't count on it. If you want a guaranteed, federal-government-backed $7,500 discount off the price of purchase, you've got about a month left to sign on the dotted line, and that's it.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-xrt.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:16.520148

On the European WLTP cycle, Mercedes says the GLC EV can travel up to 443 miles on a full charge.
For the most part, the GLC EV looks like a pretty conventional Mercedes-Benz crossover, though it's not nearly as blob-like as the EQE SUV.
Mercedes says the GLC EV will have 20.1 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, which isn't bad but is a bit less than the gas GLC.
But overall, the GLC EV isn't that much bigger than the gas While the outside of the GLC EV is evolutionary, its inside could very well be considered revolutionary.","The Mercedes-Benz GLC has been the German automaker's best-selling model for years at this point, and that trend is only going to continue as compact luxury crossovers get more popular, but the GLC has been missing something: an electric powertrain. Thus far, we've only gotten internal-combustion-powered GLCs, as the EQC never made it to our shores, but that all changes with the new GLC with EQ Technology (which I'll be calling the GLC EV from here on out). Not only is it a reinvention of Mercedes' most important model, it's also a North Star for where the automaker is headed in the future.

The GLC EV brings with it a slew of new technologies and features we're sure to see on other Mercedes-Benz vehicles, especially as it's the first car on the all-new MB.EA electric vehicle architecture. It also has an AI-driven MB.OS supercomputer to run everything, a totally redesigned cabin with a massive 39.1-inch seamless screen, even better driver-assist systems, and an exterior that blends forward-thinking design elements with nods to past iconic Mercedes-Benz models. There's a lot to like here. Let's dig in.

Underneath the skin of the GLC EV is the all-new 800-volt MB.EA architecture that Mercedes first started telling us about a few years ago. In the U.S. we're going to get two drivetrain options at launch: the rear-wheel-drive GLC300+ and the all-wheel-drive GLC400 4Matic. Mercedes says the GLC300+ will put out 369 horsepower and 372 pound-feet of torque from its single motor. That's good enough for a 5.9-second 0-to-60-mph run. The dual-motor GLC400 bests both those numbers by quite a lot, coming in at 483 hp and 596 lb-ft and dropping the claimed 0-60 time to just 4.4 seconds. Either way you get a 130-mph top speed.

Both models have a 94-kWh battery pack and can DC fast charge at up to 330 kW, and there's an integrated DC converter so they can charge at both 800-volt and 400-volt stations. Mercedes says it can charge from 10% to 80% in about 24 minutes, and about 150 miles of range can be added in just 10 minutes. On the European WLTP cycle, Mercedes says the GLC EV can travel up to 443 miles on a full charge. WLTP is more optimistic than the EPA's test, so I'd hazard that our range will be somewhere around the 390-400 mile mark.

It also comes as standard with selectable one-pedal driving. Mercedes knows this is going to be a lot of buyers' first EV, so it wants to ease everyone into it slowly. Up to 300 kW of regeneration is possible, and Mercedes says the GLC recuperates during ""over 99%"" of braking.

Like with the Porsche Taycan, Mercedes went with the two-speed transmission in an effort to optimize both performance and efficiency. First gear has a short ratio of 11:1, which gives the GLC EV quick acceleration, high towing capacity (up to 5,291 pounds) and more efficiency around town. Second gear (5:1) is designed for power delivery at higher speeds — like accelerating from an on ramp all the way up to its 130 mph top speed on the autobahn — and efficiency in highway driving. Air suspension is optional, as is rear-wheel steering that turns up to 4.5 degrees.

When you're on the highway, you'll be able to enjoy Mercedes' standard suite of driver-assist technologies that will only get better with time as they are improved with over-the-air updates. The GLC has up to ten cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors and five radar sensors.

When it comes to the outside of the GLC EV, the first thing you're going to notice is the biggest thing, that eye-catching grille up front that Mercedes says both ""marks an important milestone and redefines the face of the brand."" The ""grille"" has a wide chrome frame, a smoked-glass-look mesh structure and integrated contour lighting. Of course, there's an illuminated version available that you simply must get, which comes with 942 polycarbonate backlit dots, as well as an illuminated three-pointed star.

Other than the grille, the GLC EV isn't that wild-looking. That isn't to say it's not a handsome crossover — it definitely is, but it's fairly conservative by modern EV standards. For the most part, the GLC EV looks like a pretty conventional Mercedes-Benz crossover, though it's not nearly as blob-like as the EQE SUV. It's a nice mix between gas-powered crossovers like the existing GLC and the EQ models.

As will become standard new Mercedes-Benz fare, the headlights have three-pointed-star-shaped running lights, and the taillight bar contains small encircled star LEDs like on the recent GT XX concept. The car also comes with plenty of chrome to keep even the most traditional Mercedes fan happy, and there's a small roof spoiler at the top of the trunk to help with aerodynamics and disguise the GLC EV's sloping roofline. Mercedes says the GLC has a drag coefficient of 0.26, which is pretty good but slightly off the mark of the newly released BMW iX3, which will be the GLC's biggest competitor. You can get up to 21-inch wheels if you aren't too worried about the car's range, but 20s come as standard.

The GLC EV's 117-inch wheelbase is 3.9 inches longer than the gas-powered GLC, and because of other clever EV packaging, interior room grows for everyone. Front and rear occupants get an extra 0.5 inches and 1.9 inches of legroom, respectively, and rear headroom is up 0.6 inches, thanks in part to the standard panoramic roof.

Mercedes says the GLC EV will have 20.1 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, which isn't bad but is a bit less than the gas GLC. If that's not enough, electrically drop the 40:20:40-split second row and the space grows to a healthy 61.4 cubic feet, more than the ICE model, and the cargo floor can be lowered by 3.1 inches. If you need just a bit more space, there's a standard frunk with an extra 4.5 cubic feet of room. But overall, the GLC EV isn't that much bigger than the gas

While the outside of the GLC EV is evolutionary, its inside could very well be considered revolutionary. The big news here is the available 39.1-inch MBUX Hyperscreen, the largest display fitted to a Mercedes to date. Made up of over 1,000 individual LEDs, it combines gauge cluster, central infotainment screen and passenger display into one seamless screen that spans the whole dashboard. Intelligent dimming technology will allow for simultaneous adjustment of different sections, like if the passenger wants their side to be darker.

Mercedes says the screen can show ""high-resolution ambient styles"" as background motifs that are meant to offer a wide range of moods to the folks in the car, ""from calm to intense, cool to warm, and technical to emotional."" In addition to changing the graphics and colors across the screen, these moods also change the ambient lighting.

Mercedes-Benz

The infotainment system is an evolution of the new MBUX that debuted on the CLA, with simpler menus and better graphics than the old cars. It even has an AI virtual assistant thing with ChatGPT4o and Microsoft Bing Search that'll be your friend if you don't have one, but I really think you should try to find one.

The GLC EV's interior is about more than a big screen, though. Mercedes made it a point of emphasis to bring back buttons and knobs on both the steering wheel and center console (they live right by a pair of wireless phone chargers), replacing the haptic buttons that were previously there. It's also putting a bigger emphasis on trim and materials — the floating wood piece that follows the dash and center console is huge, the air vents are more intricate, and the door panels have more complex designs.

Of course, like all modern Mercedes-Benz models, the GLC EV's interior is festooned with all of the ambient lighting you could ever want that can be changed to 11 trillion different colors and even pulse and change along with the music. That ambient lighting can also show up on the panoramic roof, which, as an option, is covered in 162 three-pointed stars, a very neat trick.

Mercedes says the GLC EV is going to be offered with a whole slew of sustainable materials meant to create a high-quality feel in the car's interior, including the first interior certified by The Vegan Society, if that's the sort of thing you're into. If you're not, you can also choose from black, beige or brown leather options that can be paired with all sorts of lovely trim options from anthracite or metallic-blended fabric to AMG carbon fiber and birch wood. It's a Mercedes. You've got lots of options.

If you're not feeling that massive screen, you can also go for the MBUX Superscreen that separates the three zones into separate screens like on the CLA: a 10.25-inch driver display, a 14-inch infotainment screen and a 14-inch passenger display. The base GLC EV doesn't have the passenger display; instead it gets a panel with more illuminated stars.

The AMG version of the GLC EV isn't getting revealed yet, but that hasn't stopped Mercedes from offering several different AMG appearance packages on the car. You can option the GLC EV with the AMG Line, which gives it AMG exterior styling, unique AMG wheels, a sports steering wheel in Nappa leather, AMG floor mats and sports pedals. You can also opt for the AMG Line Sport Seat Package that gets you more snug seats with integrated headrests, AMG-specific stitching for the door panels and interior, cherry red leather and different graphics for the screen.

If that's not quite enough AMG for you, there's also the AMG Line Plus with Night Package, which adds all the AMG Line features plus 21-inch wheels with a black tint, a black rear spoiler, illuminated black door sills and Manufaktur seatbelts in red.

Mercedes-Benz

I hear you, AMG isn't your thing. Don't worry, there are plenty of other GLC EVs to choose from, like the Executive Line. It packages the illuminated grille with the illuminated panoramic roof and the Superscreen with the 14-inch passenger display, ambient interior lighting and illuminated door sills. You can also go for the Pinnacle Line, which gives you the Executive features plus active ambient lighting, a Burmester sound system and an air purifier.

If you're someone who wants, no needs, the best, go for the Pinnacle Plus Line. That upgrades your lights on the outside, gets you the 39.1-inch Hyperscreen, as well as an even better Burmester sound system, heated and ventilated front seats that'll massage you, and the Winter package.

We can expect to see the GLC400 4Matic hitting showroom floors in late 2026, with the GLC300+ following in early 2027. The price has yet to be announced, but with BMW's iX3 said to start at around $55,000, Mercedes probably wants to be close to that mark.

It's hard to think of a car in the past few decades that has been as important for Mercedes-Benz as the GLC with EQ Technology. Putting aside its silly name, it's a car that carries an enormous weight on its shoulders. Despite America's best efforts, the rest of the world is moving away from gas-powered vehicles and toward EVs.

For luxury brands like Mercedes, the compact crossover is the most important segment, bar none. It's been a rocky road for Mercedes trying to introduce a model in this segment in the U.S., but the GLC EV looks ready to take the world by storm, all while setting the tone for what a Mercedes-Benz is going to look like for years to come.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/2026-mercedes-benz-glc-ev-paves-the-way-for-every-upcoming-mercedes/l-intro-1757119893.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:57.273926

Still, India’s clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures.
Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.
India has also been importing solar modules from China.
Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won’t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance.","On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country’s push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.

India, the world’s most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.

In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew’s sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce four gigawatts of power each year — enough electricity for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The two-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry’s momentum. India’s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.

“When I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,” said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.

The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.

India’s solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Trump’s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump’s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.

Still, India’s clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India’s domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.

While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.

“This is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,” said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

India’s domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.

“Before the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,” he said.

Government policies, demand push growth

One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power — now half that of new coal-powered plants — and India’s many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.

Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India’s demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.

Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won’t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump’s tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump’s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.

India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline — most of which are solar — and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.

Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew’s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.

“We are in a good phase right now,” he said. “We are highly dependent on policy support, but we expect that momentum to be maintained.”

Indian manufacturing will likely grow

India still depends on imports of raw materials as well as finished solar components from China but is making progress on reducing its reliance. Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.

Neshwin Rodrigues, an analyst at climate energy think tank Ember, predicted that by 2030, India might be in a position of needing to import only the raw material polysilicon while producing other solar panel ingredients in the country.

According to India’s renewable energy ministry, the country’s solar module manufacturing capacity more than doubled to 74 gigawatts over the fiscal year ending March 2025. Solar cell manufacturing tripled in the same period, from nine gigawatts to 25 gigawatts.

India still needs Chinese raw materials because it lacks infrastructure to mine and process them, but government initiatives to produce critical minerals are slowly addressing the problem, experts said.

Shubhang Parekh of the National Solar Energy Federation of India said the supply chains needed to process the raw materials are still a work in progress, but he’s confident the challenges can be overcome.

“The next few years will be critical in determining how far we can go,” Parekh said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee2f5d2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4536+0+612/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2F1b%2Fe4a4c6a64e6797c8a74aff1f0b20%2F1f38257170c14ee9a07738f8a1141ab0.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:31.074209

Many other Redditors were thrilled to see a new EV owner enjoying their car.","A giddy new electric car owner showed off their vehicle on Reddit, asking other EV owners for helpful tips.

The Redditor shared a photo of their sleek new Volkswagen ID.3 electric model in a cool gray color.

""Been a VW owner for 11 years and I just upgraded to an ID.3 this weekend!"" the photo's caption read. ""I'm absolutely in love with it so far. Anyone got any tips and tricks to save battery or anything I should know?""

The ID.3 is one of Volkswagen's most popular EVs, with a combined electric range between 240 and 369 miles and battery capacity options ranging from 52kWh to 79kWh. The modern design and zippy driving style make it a dream EV for plenty of people, including the OP.

While this EV is fun and stylish, it's also practical. People who switch from a traditional gas-powered vehicle to an EV can enjoy fuel and maintenance savings. EVs don't require as much routine maintenance, as they don't need oil or fluid changes.

A 2020 Consumer Reports study found that EV owners saved about 60% on fuel costs compared to traditional car drivers. Additionally, a 2018 Forbes report cited a study from the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, which found that fueling an electric car costs approximately $485 per year, while a gas vehicle costs over $1,100.

You can save even more on fueling if you add solar panels to your home, making charging your car substantially cheaper. Use EnergySage's free tools to compare local installation quotes and save as much as $10,000 on new solar panels. If the upfront costs are prohibitive, consider leasing solar panels instead. Palmetto's LightReach program will install solar panels on your home for no money down.

The average passenger vehicle produces over five tons of carbon dioxide each year, according to the EPA — which significantly contributes to air pollution. Driving an EV saves you time and money on maintenance and fueling while helping reduce harmful pollution.

Many other Redditors were thrilled to see a new EV owner enjoying their car.

""I've had the same car for 3 years. Best car I've ever had. Enjoy!"" one person shared.

Polo GTI, VW’s first ever GTI EV.","VW really pulled out the stops for this year’s IAA Mobility 2025 in Munich, revealing not one but three new electric cars. We’ve already had a look at the ID. Polo (neé ID.2) and ID. Polo GTI, but the third EV is an even bigger deal. It’s the ID. Cross Concept and it previews next year’s production SUV, one with massive sales potential.

Also: VW Revives Polo Name For EV Era And Teases First Ever Electric GTI

The Cross name tells us this subcompact utility is an electric equivalent to the existing T-Cross combustion crossover, though the name is about all they have in common. The ID. Cross is one of a family of upcoming small EVs built around a new front-wheel-drive version of the MEB platform.

Other models in the family include the ID. Polo and ID. Polo GTI, both expected to hit showrooms in 2026, as well as a production version of the ID. Every1 concept shown earlier this year, which could wear the ID. Up name when it launches in 2027.

Design and Dimensions

Though it rides on virtually the same 2,601 mm (102.4 inches) wheelbase as the ID. Polo (the hatch’s WB is 1mm shorter), the 4,161 mm (163.8 inches) long ID. Cross is 108 mm (4.3 inches) longer and most obviously 58 mm (2.3 inches) taller. There’s 490 liters (17.3 cu.ft) of luggage space in the rear, plus a 25-liter (0.9 cu-ft) frunk, something no other ID EV, including the ID. Polo, has offered.

The handsome, but conservatively designed Polo also misses out on some of the Cross’s bolder and more modern design details. These include a front fascia shaped by the interplay of LED lighting elements that VW describes as “friendly,” along with three illuminated rectangles embedded in a black C-pillar, an intentional nod to both the ID. Buzz and the original Bus that inspired it.

Black plastic trims exaggerate the size of the gently flared arches, which are cut high into the bodywork, while the 21-inch wheels are wrapped in special Continental tires that carry the alloy rim’s pattern into the sidewall. It’s a clever visual flourish, though one that’s impractical, hard to see in the real world, and sure to make tire shops roll their eyes.

Relaxing Interior with Some Physical Buttons

Inside, there are clear echoes of the ID2.all concept that previewed the ID. Polo back in 2023 (VW hasn’t released ID. Polo interior pics yet). An 11-inch digital instrument cluster lies beyond a chunky, square-shaped two-spoke steering wheel and a larger, 13-inch tablet touchscreen is mounted on the top of the dashboard’s center.

Thankfully, VW has listened to criticism of its earlier cars, and a bank of hard buttons is located below, meaning you don’t have to go stabbing at virtual buttons to change the cabin temperature. There’s also a small iDrive-style rotary controller on the console.

And if you don’t want to be overwhelmed by digital information, you simply flip your smartphone so it lies face-down on the wireless charging pad. Do that that and the displays switch to ‘calm status,’ only showing essential info.

That’s not the only way the ID. Cross’s designers have tried to create a relaxing environment. Ambient lighting, fabric-covered surfaces and the Vanilla Chai (read: beige) coloring used throughout the concept’s interior are designed to calm passengers by taking cues from Parisian haute couture and high-end furniture.

For fully horizontal relaxation time, the front and rear seats fold completely flat, meaning you could sleep in the back like you would in a classic VW Bus, albeit with a fair bit less wriggle room. To ensure maximum comfort the seat backrests are finished in a material Volkswagen likens to a comfortable yoga mat.

Powertrain and Range

The German automaker has already confirmed the availability of two battery options for the Polo, but is staying tightlipped about the Cross’s battery hardware, other than revealing it can deliver a 261-mile (420 km) WLTP electric range. A single motor mounted in the nose sends 208 hp (211 PS / 155 kW) to the front wheels, slightly less than the 223 hp (226 PS / 166 kW) mustered by the ID. Polo GTI, VW’s first ever GTI EV.

Officially, the ID. Cross is just a concept, but next summer’s production SUV is going to be virtually identical. In fact, VW even makes a point of mentioning that the interior door handles, which you pull upwards, are production ready. And that should worry rival carmakers because we think VW has nailed this EV’s design in a way it totally failed to do with the ID.4 and ID.7.

US sales are yet to be confirmed, but the ID. Cross will cost from around £25k/€28k when it launches late in 2026 against electric crossovers like the Kia EV2, Toyota Urban Cruiser, Ford Puma Gen-E and Volvo EX30.

Meanwhile, AI-driven industrial reallocation is altering freight demand patterns.","The U.S. railroad sector is at a crossroads, and CSX Corporation’s recent financial struggles epitomize the broader challenges facing the industry. In the first half of 2025, CSX reported declining operating income and revenue, driven by shrinking coal demand, reduced fuel surcharges, and weaker merchandise volumes [1]. While the company has made strides in improving network efficiency, its performance underscores a systemic dilemma: the collision of legacy energy dependencies with the accelerating forces of AI-driven industrial reallocation and the global energy transition.

The Energy Transition: A Double-Edged Sword

Coal remains a critical revenue stream for CSX, yet its relevance is waning. First-half 2025 results showed coal revenue declines, mirroring broader trends as global markets shift toward renewables. According to the International Energy Agency, coal’s role in electricity generation is projected to shrink as solar and wind capacity expands, particularly in developing economies [2]. While U.S. domestic coal consumption for power generation rose slightly in 2025 due to data center growth and electric vehicle demand [3], export coal volumes face headwinds. China and India’s reduced reliance on imported thermal coal has dampened demand, directly impacting railroads like CSX, which depend on international shipments [4].

The energy transition’s paradox lies in its potential to reduce emissions while straining traditional freight models. Electrification of railroads, for instance, could cut carbon footprints and maintenance costs by 20% [5], but the upfront investment remains prohibitive. For CSX, this means balancing short-term profitability with long-term sustainability—a challenge compounded by the Trump administration’s freeze on Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean energy funding [6].

AI-Driven Reallocation: Efficiency Gains vs. Structural Shifts

Artificial intelligence is reshaping the railroad sector, but its benefits are unevenly distributed. CSX has invested heavily in AI since 2016, deploying tools like predictive maintenance systems, trespassing detection, and the AI assistant Chessie to enhance customer engagement [7]. These initiatives have improved on-time performance by 8–12% and reduced derailments [8]. However, such gains are incremental compared to the transformative AI strategies of peers like Union Pacific and BNSF.

Union Pacific, for example, is leveraging AI for locomotive innovation, including hybrid battery-electric engines to cut emissions [9], while BNSF uses AI-powered diagnostics to monitor wheel health and track conditions in real time [10]. These investments not only optimize operations but also position these railroads to capitalize on AI-driven freight demand reallocation. Startups and logistics platforms are using physics-inspired algorithms and agentic AI to reroute shipments dynamically, reducing delivery times by 11.7% and inventory costs by 16.3% [11]. For CSX, the gap between its AI adoption and competitors’ aggressive digital transformation efforts may exacerbate its competitive disadvantages.

Sector-Wide Pressures: Coal’s Decline and Freight Demand Volatility

The U.S. railroad industry’s reliance on coal—accounting for 35% of global rail freight volumes in 2025 [12]—is increasingly unsustainable. While domestic coal demand for power generation has stabilized temporarily, export markets remain volatile. CSX’s struggles reflect this duality: domestic thermal coal consumption rose to 371.7 million short tons in 2025 [13], but export volumes are projected to fall to 104 million short tons [14]. This dichotomy creates a precarious balance for railroads, which must navigate fluctuating demand while investing in cleaner technologies.

Meanwhile, AI-driven industrial reallocation is altering freight demand patterns. Machine learning systems are optimizing supply chains to minimize emissions and costs, with AI negotiation agents enabling real-time freight pricing adjustments [15]. For railroads, this means shifting from volume-based growth to value-added services, a transition that requires significant operational and technological agility—areas where CSX’s recent performance suggests room for improvement.

Conclusion: A Sector in Transition

CSX’s stagnant performance is not an isolated issue but a microcosm of the railroad sector’s broader struggle to adapt to decarbonization and AI-driven industrial shifts. While the company has made strides in AI adoption and infrastructure modernization, its reliance on coal and slower pace of digital transformation leave it vulnerable to sector-wide headwinds. For investors, the key question is whether CSX can accelerate its pivot toward sustainable, AI-optimized operations—or risk falling further behind peers who are redefining the future of freight.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 19:02:16.231398

But its true impact extends well beyond incentives: OBBBA is unsettling the entire financial and insurance underpinning of the U.S. clean energy industry.

OBBBA has accelerated deadlines, with projects now required to begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. It has also removed the 5% cost-based safe harbor starting September 1, 2025, meaning that only physical work counts toward eligibility. That change alone has lenders and insurers spooked, uncertain when or if returns will materialize.

Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs on essential materials like steel, copper, and solar components have pushed construction costs even higher. “We’re really now seeing the impacts of what the new reality in the U.S. has meant for investor confidence,” says Meredith Annex, Head of Clean Power at BloombergNEF, after reporting that wind and solar investments plunged 36% year-on-year to $36.4 billion in H1 2025, with onshore wind collapsing 80 percent, the Financial Times reported.

At the same time, insurance is becoming a major issue. Underwriters are recalibrating risk models that now include political unpredictability. As Canaan Crouch of Jencap Specialty Insurance Services warns, “Higher insurance premiums add another cost burden to contractors and developers already grappling with reduced subsidies, higher tariffs and volatile demand.” That’s effectively redefining how projects are valued and bankrolled.

Insurers are tightening their terms in ways that directly reshape project economics. Premiums for utility-scale solar and offshore wind have climbed sharply over the past year, with underwriters increasingly carving out exclusions for mechanical failure and weather-related damage, according to Reuters. Industry brokers say some carriers have shortened policy durations from three years to one, forcing developers to renegotiate coverage annually at higher cost. In offshore wind, several European reinsurers have already reduced their U.S. exposure, leaving a smaller pool of carriers willing to underwrite billion-dollar projects and driving up rates for those that remain.

The disruption is being felt by the industry’s biggest players. Denmark’s Ørsted, once a clean-energy trailblazer, has approved a $9.4 billion emergency rights issue after its U.S. offshore wind projects, Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, hit policy roadblocks. Construction on Revolution Wind, almost 80% complete, was halted by a federal stop-work order citing national security concerns, prompting Ørsted to sue the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the company is burning millions weekly in holding costs, and S&P Global has already downgraded its credit rating though Equinor, a 10% shareholder, has pledged up to $941 million in support.

Nor is this limited to utility-scale clean energy.

In residential solar, firms like Sunnova and Mosaic have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy amid uncertainty over tax credits and a decline in demand. Canary Media reported that Sunnova laid off over half its workforce (over 700 employees) before filing, citing untenable debt and market retrenchment. Mosaic, a major residential solar loan provider, also went bankrupt, pointing to macroeconomic headwinds and policy unpredictability.

These are not small casualties. Analysts predict a 50-60% reduction in residential solar demand, risking over 250,000 jobs. As Ara Agopian, CEO of Solar Insure, put it, “There’s going to be a 50 to 60 percent downturn in demand. Many of them will shut their doors as they can’t stay in business without the tax credit.” The Financial Times noted that Guggenheim’s Joe Osha underscored the long-standing difficulties.

In Sunnova’s case, a July 31, 2025 court approval allowed the sale of substantially all assets to a creditor group highlighting how even bankruptcy is being managed to mitigate fallout for homeowners.

States are also feeling the heat, with Texas, once a renewable stronghold, seeing developers cancel or delay nearly $8 billion in projects, while BloombergNEF has tallied over $22 billion in clean energy development shelved nationally, costing more than 16,000 jobs.

Beyond wind and solar, OBBBA’s implications also extend to battery and hydrogen sectors. The law phases out credits for battery manufacturing and accelerates deadlines for hydrogen projects under Section 45V. Experts at the International Council on Clean Transportation estimate U.S. battery production could fall 75 percent short of expectations by 2030, cutting into the clean energy value chain.

Banks that once offered competitive terms on project loans are now widening spreads to reflect heightened policy risk, while credit rating agencies have flagged uncertainty over future cash flows as a trigger for downgrades. Institutional investors that fueled the tax-equity boom of the past decade are becoming more selective, in some cases pausing commitments entirely until the regulatory landscape stabilizes. The result is a much smaller pipeline of available capital and steeper financing costs for developers.

What’s emerging is a clarity that OBBBA’s biggest impact may be the erosion of the industry’s financial ecosystem. Insurance premiums are climbing. Lenders are retreating or demanding new risk-adjusted returns. Developers are cannibalizing capital just to stay afloat.

Conclusion Regulatory risks in the energy sector are no longer confined to compliance failures; they encompass legislative volatility, geopolitical tensions, and the rapid evolution of sustainability mandates.","The energy sector in 2025 remains a high-stakes arena for investors, where regulatory shifts and compliance failures can swiftly disrupt market dynamics. Recent legislative actions, such as the U.S. House of Representatives’ reconciliation bill amending the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), have accelerated the phase-out of critical clean energy tax credits, while cease trade orders against firms like Altima Energy Inc. and Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. underscore the fragility of regulatory compliance in this sector [1]. For investors, the imperative is clear: preparedness and strategic agility are no longer optional but essential to safeguarding returns.

The Escalating Threat of Cease Trade Orders

Cease trade orders (CTOs) have become a recurring risk for energy firms, particularly those in renewable and emerging technologies. In August 2025, Eguana Technologies Inc. saw its management cease trade order lifted by the Alberta Securities Commission after fulfilling filing requirements, but similar fates have befallen companies like A.I.S. Resources Limited, which voluntarily accepted a CTO due to insufficient funds for audit fees [3]. These cases highlight a broader trend: regulatory bodies are tightening scrutiny of financial transparency, especially for firms operating in capital-intensive, high-growth sectors like green hydrogen and battery recycling.

For investors, the implications are twofold. First, CTOs often trigger liquidity crises, as seen when Altima Energy’s failure to file financial reports led to a trading halt on the TSX Venture Exchange [1]. Second, they signal systemic risks—companies unable to meet disclosure standards may lack the governance structures to navigate evolving regulatory landscapes.

Legislative and Policy Volatility: A Double-Edged Sword

The U.S. House reconciliation bill exemplifies how policy shifts can reconfigure market fundamentals overnight. By accelerating the expiration of clean energy tax credits, the legislation has compressed project timelines for developers, creating a “race against the clock” to secure financing and construction permits [1]. Similarly, the EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) updates for 2023–2025 have introduced compliance complexities for biofuel producers, requiring firms to balance environmental mandates with operational costs [3].

Investors must also contend with geopolitical regulatory risks. Turkey’s investigation of 66 power firms for grid non-compliance and the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security’s closure of a semiconductor export loophole illustrate how cross-border regulatory actions can disrupt supply chains and investor confidence [2].

Strategic Preparedness: Mitigating Risks Through Proactive Measures

To navigate these challenges, investors are adopting a multi-pronged approach:

Enhanced Due Diligence on Regulatory Filings

Monitoring regulatory filings and company announcements is now a cornerstone of risk management. For instance, Li-Cycle’s CTO was directly linked to its failure to submit periodic disclosures, a red flag for investors who might otherwise overlook operational delays [3]. Tools like real-time compliance tracking platforms and third-party due diligence services are increasingly being deployed to flag early warning signs.

Diversification Across Regulatory Environments

Diversifying geographically and sectorially helps hedge against localized regulatory shocks. For example, offshore wind developers like Ørsted and Equinor, who faced setbacks under the Trump administration’s 2025 policy overhaul, are redirecting investments to Europe and Asia-Pacific markets with more stable regulatory frameworks [2]. Similarly, utilities in wildfire-prone regions are prioritizing grid hardening and real-time monitoring to align with state-level liability mandates, reducing litigation risks [1].

Leveraging Policy Tools for Risk Mitigation

Political risk insurance (PRI) and revised force majeure clauses in contracts are becoming standard for energy projects. These instruments protect against sudden policy changes, such as the abrupt suspension of U.S. offshore wind leasing in 2025, which left developers with stranded assets [2]. Additionally, governments are incentivizing compliance through green subsidies and tax rebates, as seen in the EU’s Net-Zero Industry Act and China’s offshore wind expansion [2].

The Long-Term Outlook: Balancing Stability and Innovation

While regulatory uncertainty persists, the energy transition’s momentum remains robust. Global decarbonization trends, including advancements in offshore wind and green hydrogen, suggest that long-term investments in renewables will outpace short-term volatility. However, investors must balance near-term stability—such as returns from traditional energy assets—with strategic bets on technologies that demonstrate cost competitiveness and scalable deployment pipelines [2].

Conclusion

Regulatory risks in the energy sector are no longer confined to compliance failures; they encompass legislative volatility, geopolitical tensions, and the rapid evolution of sustainability mandates. For investors, the path forward lies in proactive monitoring, diversified portfolios, and strategic alignment with policy frameworks. As the sector navigates these crosscurrents, those who prioritize preparedness will be best positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 17:01:56.812665

Yet, at community colleges nationwide, environmental stewardship is not just an add-on, but a fundamental thread woven into the fabric of the institution.

A sustainability master plan serves as the blueprint for this work, shaping a college’s daily functions and educational offerings. From geothermal systems heating classrooms to hands-on training for green jobs, these academic eco-advocates are dedicated to softening their environmental impact and operating costs.

This article comes from the current issue of the Community College Journal, published by the American Association of Community Colleges.

With a clear sustainability plan in place, it’s easier to track results and maintain momentum, regardless of staff turnover or competing priorities, says Michael Boyd, president of Kankakee Community College (KCC) in Illinois.

“Sustainability and renewable energy are integrated into curriculum development, budgeting and evaluation of faculty and staff,” says Boyd. “It’s been a focus throughout the history of KCC, and part of our culture.”

In its DNA

KCC is a founding member of the Illinois Green Economy Network, formed in 2008 to drive sustainable workforce growth and a clean energy economy in state. Financed by a $2.5 million grant from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the network allocates funds for curriculum development along with a handful of renewable energy projects and initiatives.

A partnership with the Illinois Community College Board, for example, supports the state’s growing electric vehicle industry through job training and technology development programs, Boyd says.

Sustainability is a core facet of life at KCC, a vision that began in the 2000s under the leadership of late president, Jerry Weber. Successor John Avendano continued this work, strengthening an eco-forward mindset further cultivated by retired electrical engineering professor Tim Wilhelm.

KCC’s environmental work is structured around three pillars: building features, on-campus sustainability and certificate completion. The college’s North Extension Center, the county’s first LEED Gold-certified building, boasts energy-efficient lighting and a white synthetic rubber roof that significantly reduces heat absorption.

KCC also offers renewable energy certificates in solar-photovoltaic, solar-thermal and wind technologies, while an associate degree in electrical engineering is designed with a career-minded sustainability focus.

Boyd embraces this mission, believing that responsibility for the planet transcends any single department at KCC. A whole-college commitment is needed to push the work ahead even beyond his tenure, he says.

“We see renewable energy and sustainability as something that’s bigger than ourselves,” Boyd says. “At other colleges, you may have a divide between operations and academic affairs. But at KCC, we have an alliance that inspires our business processes. Even little things, like everyone shutting off their lights for a couple hours, or shutting off their computers, can make a difference. It’s a great value for us, because part of our mission is to be good with our fiscal resources. We have to live that vision for ourselves.”

‘A moral imperative’

In California, Chaffey College’s 35-page sustainability master plan outlines a “triple bottom line” of social, economic and environmental responsibility led by the Green Earth Movement (GEM) committee. Comprised of staff and faculty, this environmental think tank provides campus-wide education while encouraging green practices among students and stakeholders.

“In the broadest sense, we adopted a policy of stewardship, in terms of being efficient with our resources,” says Sam Gaddie, sustainability and environmental safety officer at Chaffey. “GEM is a way to bring this information forward to administrators and communicate this work with students and the community.”

Such transparency is vital, as limited budgets sometimes push green projects aside for larger initiatives. A central aim of the GEM taskforce is to maintain the visibility of all its sustainable initiatives, Gaddie says.

“We’ve got a million competing interests (at Chaffey), and know that certain decisions have to be made,” he says. “We try and make our case that these sustainable options will save money in the long run.”

Successful projects

Despite some frustrations around resource allocation, Chaffey has much to celebrate regarding its environmental practices, Gaddie says. Per terms established by the master plan, any new construction at the college is built to state-mandated green building standards. In addition, Chaffey utilizes native plants and drought-tolerant landscaping on all three campuses.

A large-scale solar carport project spanning Chaffey’s campuses has offset over half the college’s electricity consumption. In recognition of this achievement, the college was one of a dozen two-year colleges to receive a California Community Colleges Board of Governors Energy and Sustainability Award in 2020.

Far from working in silos, the GEM committee collaborates with regional utilities and companies for Earth Day celebrations, with aims of raising awareness on critical issues. Chaffey even partners with a local shepherd on weed management, using goats to graze instead of relying on chemicals or gas-guzzling machinery.

Such partnerships are standard for a college dedicated to environmental literacy, Gaddie says.

“As an institution of higher learning, we took this on as a moral imperative,” he says. “It helps us think about the decisions we’re making, and to set the tone with the community.”

Developing an eco-mindset

Community colleges are incorporating sustainability into curriculum, extending beyond simple environmental courses to include adjacent fields. At Chaffey, statistics students analyze bell curves using an online dashboard that displays the school’s solar energy output. Enrollees in the college’s STEM pathway study heat exchangers that power an on-campus thermal energy storage tank.

“Students are analyzing data to use it for in-class projects,” says Gaddie. “They’re learning a topic and getting to see its real-world applications.”

Bronx Community College’s (BCC) eco-conscious approach stretches back 20 years, when an automotive program began incorporating electric vehicles and alternative fuels into classroom training. In 2023, BCC received a $1 million grant, funded by the New York Power Authority, to improve campus sustainability and reduce the college’s environmental impact. The award also funded a green workforce training program, providing solar and wind turbine instruction to residents and students from across the City University of New York system.

In addition, learners designed logos for campus recycling bins, an exciting opportunity to apply chosen career skills to real-world challenges, notes Elena Perez, project director of BCC’s Green Action Challenge team, which oversees the college’s sustainability efforts.

“The public can see the designs created by students,” says Perez. “It’s wonderful way to convey our message effectively.”

In May, BCC selected three students to promote campus environmental initiatives. These “green ambassadors” will partner with college groups to raise awareness on climate resilience efforts, ranging from composting bins to a joint rain garden project.

Nor is BCC’s student-centric environmental stance limited to campus, or even the borders of the United States. Last year, the college sent students to India as part of the CUNY-India Pollution Study — a three-year research program funded by the National Science Foundation focused on mapping air pollution in underserved communities.

Every aspect of this work is purposeful and seamlessly linked with the school’s broader environmental goals, says Richard Ginsberg, assistant vice president of communications and marketing. Rallying behind sustainability means living it daily. Ginsberg was pleased to find composting bins at the college’s Run the Bronx footrace, allowing participants to dispose of fruit peels after orange and banana giveaways.

“We also switched from plastic water bottles to boxed (for the race),” says Ginsberg. “It’s just a mindset on the way we do things on campus every day. The little things add up, and that mindset stays in place despite staff turnover and changing priorities.”",https://www.ccdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guth_Chaffey-Solar-Parking-cred-Chaffey-002.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 18:00:36.058887

Not much changed immediately for electric vehicle drivers across Canada after the federal government announced a step back from its EV policy. But many drivers fear infrastructural growth and improved public charging stations will slow in the coming years.

When Julien Kos drove to Moncton earlier this year, his plan heavily relied on charging his vehicle at a mall while getting a quick bite.

“I got there with 15 per cent and I expected to be able to just charge at the mall,” said Kos, who lives in a remote town of Back Bay, N.B., about 130 kilometres south of Fredericton. But he found several public chargers were broken.

Kos said many provincial public chargers are “unreliable,” while others chargers owned by Tesla are older and compatible with only Tesla vehicles. With the pause in the EV mandate, he feels fewer automakers would be inclined to keep investing in EVs, resulting in a slowdown in overall infrastructure growth.

“It’s definitely disappointing to see that there’s not enough infrastructure in our province, specifically,” said Kos, who bought his first Tesla EV in January. The policy shift hasn’t changed his plans to keep driving his car.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday that the federal government will not implement a mandate requiring that 20 per cent of all new vehicles sold in Canada by next year be electric, while promising a 60-day review of the country’s electric-vehicle program.

The mandate was initially designed to increase until 2035, by which point all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada were to be fully electric or plug-in hybrids.

Carney said the review is aimed at finding “future flexibilities and ways to reduce costs” while government documents suggest amendments to the annual sales targets, including the 2035 goal, will be considered.

The pause likely won’t affect EV adoptions nor those who already have one, said Tracy Miersch, EV ambassador team leader for MEET Moncton, who bought her first EV four years ago.

“Where I think it might impact is the car manufacturers that haven’t really bought into the EV idea,” she said in an interview. “They might slow their development.”

MEET, or Mobile EV Education Trailer, is a program run by Plug’n Drive Canada, an organization that focuses on EV education.

Miersch said there’s a concern that government grants for improved public charging stations could be affected, but private companies could help with that gap in the existing infrastructure.

“There are enough private companies and businesses that are now seeing the advantage of having an EV charger at or near their location,” she said.

Coffee chain Tim Hortons announced last month its plans to set up EV fast chargers at 100 locations across the country by the end of 2028. The company has partnered with the charging company FLO.

“I’m not worried about the infrastructure growing,” said Angie Thomas, secretary of the board of the Electric Vehicle Association of Alberta. “But I do worry about future charging projects coming.”

Thomas said the move could hurt Canada’s chance of getting ahead of the electric curve.

“Technology is moving ahead very quickly, but we need to embrace this technology or we risk being left behind,” Thomas said.

For Alroy Brouwer, the federal government’s decision to pause the mandate doesn’t affect his decision to trade in his second vehicle for an EV when the car is at the end of its life.

“Once people start driving an EV, they’re not going back to a gas-powered car again,” said the Barrie, Ont., resident, who bought his first EV three years ago.

“You quickly realize how stupid it is to burn $20 in gas every day to get somewhere.”

But his decision heavily relies on the comfort of home-charging infrastructure.

“If you can’t charge it at home, then right now, with our infrastructure, it’s not as easy as switching over,” Brouwer said.

He said many public charging stations on southern Ontario highways tend to be unreliable and are often out of service, or can be fairly expensive to top up the car.

The mandate pause comes at a time when EVs are seeing a dip in uptake. An AutoTrader survey from April showed 42 per cent of respondents say they’re considering an EV as their next vehicle, down from 46 per cent last year. In 2022, 68 per cent said they would consider buying an EV.

EV adoption isn’t going to be linear, Kristian Aquilina, president of GM Canada, said at a conference in Vancouver on Saturday. He added the policies around EVs need to be more reflective of consumer demand, rather than a forced outcome from federal mandates.

“We would be pursuing a future whereby EV policy in this country is just a bit more reflective of the realities of consumer demand, rather than a forced outcome,” he said.

Beyond the usual summer hum of air conditioners, power demand is surging from electric vehicle chargers and sprawling new data centers. At the same time, the infrastructure built to deliver reliable electricity is aging and showing its limits. From Texas heatwaves to California blackouts, the warning signs are impossible to ignore.

This isn’t a technical challenge—it’s an economic and political reckoning. If the grid fails, it won’t be because we lacked solutions. It will be because we didn’t act quickly enough.

A Demand Surge Few Anticipated

For nearly two decades, U.S. electricity demand was flat. Now, consumption is climbing, driven by technologies that arrived faster than planners expected.

Artificial intelligence has unleashed a wave of data center construction. These facilities, dense with high-performance servers and cooling systems, are among the most power-hungry assets in the country. In 2023, AI data centers consumed about 4.4% of U.S. electricity, and that share could triple by 2028, according to Penn State’s Institute of Energy and the Environment.

Northern Virginia—“Data Center Alley”—now handles 70% of global internet traffic, pushing utilities like Dominion Energy to scramble for capacity. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google warn that a shortage of skilled electricians could delay expansion, with estimates that the U.S. will need 500,000 more electricians in the next decade.

Electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electrified industry are adding further strain. The Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee projects growth equivalent to seven Seattle-sized cities within ten years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. electricity sales to rise from 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025, with similar gains to follow.

And finally, there’s climate. As extreme heat events multiply, cooling demand in places like Texas and Arizona is surging—driving peak loads to new records.

The Supply Gap: Retirements Outpace Replacement

Just as demand is accelerating, the U.S. is retiring some of its most dependable sources of power.

The EIA projects 12.3 gigawatts (GW) of capacity will retire in 2025, a 65% jump over 2024. That includes 8.1 GW of coal, such as the 1,800-MW Intermountain Power Project in Utah, plus another 2.6 GW of natural gas. These plants provide round-the-clock power that intermittent sources cannot yet replace.

Wind and solar capacity continue to grow, but not fast enough. The Department of Energy’s July 2025 Resource Adequacy Report warns that only 22 GW of firm generation is expected by 2030—well short of the 104 GW needed for peak demand. Transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays, and slow adoption of long-duration storage compound the problem.

Grid operators from PJM, MISO, ERCOT, and others told Congress bluntly in March 2025: “Demand is accelerating, supply is lagging, and current tools may not be enough to bridge the gap.”

Growing Vulnerabilities: Weather, Cyber, and Sabotage

Beyond the supply-demand imbalance, the grid faces mounting risks.

Heatwaves, wildfires, and storms are stressing transmission systems nationwide. Events once considered rare—like the 2003 Northeast blackout that hit 50 million people—are now seen as precursors of larger disruptions.

As smart grids and distributed resources proliferate, so do digital entry points for hackers. In 2024, DOE funded 16 cybersecurity projects, including Georgia Tech’s AI-based “DerGuard” system to monitor risks in distributed energy.

Sabotage at substations and transmission lines is also rising. With more than 160,000 miles of high-voltage lines and 7,300 plants, much of it decades old, the system is a sprawling, exposed target. Homeland Security now classifies grid protection alongside nuclear and water infrastructure.

Policy Gridlock and Infrastructure Delays

Despite the alarms, policy responses remain sluggish.

Jurisdiction is a big part of the problem. Regional transmission operators manage the grid but don’t own generation or lines. Utilities do, while states control siting and permitting. The result is a patchwork that slows progress.

As of mid-2024, transmission projects across the U.S. faced delays of five to seven years due to permitting hurdles, interconnection bottlenecks, and supply chain constraints. By mid-2025, lead times for large power transformers had stretched beyond 30 months, with some units requiring up to four years for delivery—posing serious risks to grid reliability and expansion.

Even bipartisan efforts like the CIRCUIT Act—introduced in February 2025 to incentivize domestic transformer production through a 10% tax credit—remain stalled in committee, despite widespread industry support and urgent supply chain concerns.

Meanwhile, subsidies continue to favor intermittent renewables over firm capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act accelerated clean energy deployment, but without parallel investment in balancing technologies, reliability risks grow.

What’s Being Done

Federal and private efforts are ramping up, though often as short-term fixes.

DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants and issued reliability directives under the Federal Power Act. These measures keep the lights on but do little to build long-term resilience. DOE also aims to increase long-distance capacity 16% by 2030, adding 7,500 miles of new lines. But permitting delays and local resistance remain obstacles.

In 2025, DOE launched $32 million in pilot projects for smart EV charging, responsive buildings, and distributed energy integration. These solutions could eventually scale, but utilities and regulators must buy in.

Investor Implications: Reliability as a Premium

For investors, grid instability is a risk, but also an opportunity.

Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion, and Avangrid are investing billions in grid modernization and diversified generation. Avangrid alone plans $20 billion through 2030 across 23 states.

Independent power producers are also benefiting from the shifting landscape. NRG Energy, one of the nation’s largest competitive power suppliers, has seen its shares climb sharply as rising demand boosts wholesale electricity prices. Unlike regulated utilities, NRG and its peers compete in deregulated markets, where higher load growth and tighter capacity directly translate into stronger margins. That dynamic could make competitive generators an overlooked winner in a strained grid environment.

Firms like Fluence, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are seeing growing demand for storage and microgrid solutions. Pilot programs backed by DOE may open new markets for software-driven load management.

With coal exiting and renewables constrained, power generated by nuclear energy and natural gas retain a “reliability premium.” Deloitte estimates the U.S. power sector will need $1.4 trillion in new capital between 2025 and 2030, with similar levels required through 2050. Firms able to supply firm generation or grid services stand to benefit.

Conclusion: Crisis or Course Correction?

The U.S. power grid isn’t collapsing—but it is under pressure like never before. Demand growth, baseload retirements, extreme weather, and policy paralysis are colliding to create a fragile system.

Whether this moment becomes a crisis or a correction depends on how quickly policymakers, utilities, and investors adapt. The tools exist—firm generation, smart load management, and modern transmission. But without faster coordination and realistic incentives, the U.S. risks trading energy abundance for energy fragility.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68bdbbb7a1d1e323abe0cf0a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-07 14:01:14.825553

Conclusion: A Calculated Gambit CATL’s gigafactory expansion is a masterclass in strategic positioning.","The electric vehicle (EV) revolution is reshaping global industrial landscapes, and no company embodies this transformation more than Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. (CATL). As the world’s largest EV battery supplier, CATL’s aggressive expansion into Europe and Asia is not merely a bet on growth—it’s a calculated move to dominate the next era of mobility. With a 37% global market share in 2023 [1], CATL is leveraging its technological prowess, strategic partnerships, and geopolitical agility to secure a commanding position in the EV supply chain. This analysis evaluates the investment potential of CATL’s European and Asian manufacturing footprint, weighing the interplay of demand, policy tailwinds, and competitive dynamics.

Europe: A High-Stakes Bet on Localization

CATL’s European expansion is anchored by its €7.34 billion Debrecen, Hungary, gigafactory, which will produce 100 GWh annually by 2025 [2]. This facility, part of a broader €13.2 billion European investment, underscores CATL’s commitment to localizing production for key clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Daimler. The Hungarian plant’s focus on lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries—a cost-effective alternative to nickel-based cells—positions it to capitalize on Europe’s growing demand for affordable EVs. According to the European Commission, the continent’s battery cell production capacity could reach 886 GWh by 2030 [3], aligning with CATL’s ambitions to meet surging demand while circumventing EU concerns over Chinese overcapacity.

However, CATL’s European strategy is not without risks. The EU’s fragmented regulatory environment and scrutiny of foreign investment pose challenges. For instance, CATL’s joint venture with Stellantis in Spain has drawn criticism for lacking technology transfer agreements, potentially leaving Europe reliant on Chinese expertise [4]. Additionally, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and EU Green Deal Industrial Plan (GDIP) are reshaping subsidy landscapes, favoring domestic producers. CATL’s “License Royalty Service” model—outsourcing production to local partners while retaining IP—may mitigate these risks but could dilute long-term control [5].

Asia: Leveraging China’s EV Supercycle

In Asia, CATL’s dominance is underpinned by China’s EV boom, where the company supplies batteries to Tesla, Toyota, and BYD. China’s aggressive electrification policies, including tax breaks and NEV quotas, have driven EV adoption to 35% of total car sales in 2024 [6]. CATL’s innovations—such as sodium-ion batteries and high-nickel cylindrical cells—are critical to maintaining cost advantages as global pack prices fall below $50/kWh [7].

Yet, CATL faces intensifying competition from domestic rivals like BYD, whose blade battery technology is gaining traction. Internationally, LG Energy Solution and Northvolt are expanding in Europe, with LG’s Italian plant targeting 120 GWh by 2030 [8]. CATL’s LFP strategy offers a distinct edge: LFP batteries, which are 30% cheaper than NMC variants, are becoming the preferred choice for mainstream EVs [9]. This cost advantage is amplified by CATL’s vertical integration, including a planned cathode materials plant in Morocco to secure phosphate supplies for its European operations [10].

Financials and ROI: A Long-Term Play

CATL’s Q1 2025 results highlight its financial resilience: net profit surged 32.9% year-over-year to ¥14 billion ($2 billion), driven by cost reductions and a shift to high-margin technologies like sodium-ion batteries [11]. While specific break-even timelines for European gigafactories remain undisclosed, industry benchmarks suggest a 10–15-year horizon due to high capital expenditures [12]. The EU’s battery recycling market, projected to grow at 32.05% CAGR through 2030, could further enhance ROI by monetizing CATL’s LFP recycling expertise [13].

Geopolitical Risks and Strategic Resilience

CATL’s global expansion is a double-edged sword. In Europe, environmental compliance and supply chain dependencies—such as reliance on Chinese-sourced materials—pose operational risks. For example, CATL’s U.S. BESS unit was disconnected over security concerns, illustrating the fragility of cross-border partnerships [14]. Meanwhile, the EU’s push for “strategic autonomy” could impose stricter foreign investment rules, complicating CATL’s growth trajectory.

Conclusion: A Calculated Gambit

CATL’s gigafactory expansion is a masterclass in strategic positioning. By aligning with Europe’s decarbonization goals while leveraging China’s manufacturing scale, the company is hedging against regional uncertainties. However, its success hinges on navigating geopolitical tensions and outpacing rivals in innovation. For investors, CATL represents a high-conviction opportunity in the EV supply chain, albeit one requiring patience and a nuanced understanding of global policy dynamics.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 19:01:20.435843

That allows the family to use stored solar power to run the dishwasher and laundry, even after the sun goes down, and to earn a credit of up to $60 per month on their electricity bill in the summer.

The solar panels and battery provide benefits not just for the Calders but for the entire electrical grid. They're designed to join forces with the solar panels and batteries of 99 other homes as part of a virtual power plant (VPP) that supplies power to the grid, similar to what a physical power plant does.

""It feels good when you can see your power going to the grid. It feels good when you see that first credit on the bill,"" said Calder, whose family moved into the net-zero home in January.

Proponents of virtual power plants say they make it possible to add more wind and solar to the grid by filling the gaps when it's not windy or sunny.

VPPs can also help stabilize the grid by matching electricity supply with demand and reduce or defer the need to spend money on building physical power plants and other electricity infrastructure, saving money for both utilities and other ratepayers.

What are virtual power plants?

Virtual power plants are networks of devices that generate, use and store energy, such as smart thermostats, electric vehicle batteries and solar panels with battery storage. By connecting and controlling them together, the energy saved, stored or released by the network eventually adds up to the scale of a physical power plant.

So far, most VPPs in Canada have been limited to networks of smart thermostats that utilities can temporarily adjust to reduce electricity demand and relieve strain on the grid.

But the new virtual power plant that the Calders are a part of can also generate and deploy electricity, like a traditional power plant.

How do they work?

In summer, solar panels on the homes of the Calders and their neighbours generate more energy than they use.

Extra solar is stored in the battery in their basement, supplied by the German company Sonnen, which also makes the software for the project. The battery is controlled by local utilities EPCOR and Solartility, two other partners in the project.

Geoff Ferrell, senior vice-president of virtual power plants at Sonnen, said either utility can draw from the batteries of the VPP if they need to stabilize the local grid or when the price of electricity is high, making it advantageous for the utility to sell to the wholesale market.

The homeowner can monitor what's happening but can't control it.

Calder said sometimes when she's bored, she'll check the mobile app that tells her how much power is being produced, stored and returned to the grid. She likes the simplicity for homeowners.

""We don't need to think about it,"" she said.

Calder said she feels her family is doing their part to solve the climate crisis by generating renewable energy. ""It's such a small thing to do, but it's helping.""

On a typical day, she said, the software stops the battery from being drained below 30 per cent, so her family will always have backup power in case of an outage.

Benefits for the grid

Brent Harris is vice-chair of Decentralised Energy Canada, an industry group dedicated to the development of distributed energy technology, such as district heating, microgrids and virtual power plants. Aside from providing benefits for individual customers, he said, VPPs can help solve another big problem: the skyrocketing demand for electricity.

""People are adopting electric vehicles. People are switching from gas to electricity and heat pumps,"" Harris said, ""at the same time as you're seeing all these data centres coming on.""

Reports from the International Energy Agency and the Canadian Climate Institute found Canada would need to double or triple its electrical grid capacity by 2050 to reach its net-zero emissions goal.

That would require costly upgrades to the entire grid, from transformers to substations to distribution lines.

WATCH | How to go green and build a net-zero dream home:

Harris said generating power close to where it's consumed is another option.

""We need to get more out of the grid that we already have,"" he said. ""If we can put these smart assets out there, actually we don't need to upgrade those lines for decades into the future.""

Harris is also the founder and chief operating officer of Calgary-based Eguana Technologies Inc., a home battery storage provider that is building a one megawatt virtual power plant with B.C. Hydro. The utility is offering batteries for free to 200 homes where the local grid would otherwise need capacity upgrades to ensure reliability.

As with the Blatchford project, the homeowner will get backup power from the batteries, but the utility will control them. B.C. Hydro can charge the batteries when demand is low. During peak times, it can disconnect them from the grid and get the homeowners to rely on the battery, reducing demand on the local grid.

Room to grow?

So far, the Blatchford virtual power plant includes only about 20 townhomes completed by Landmark Homes. But by the end of 2026, the development is expected to have 100 homes whose solar panels and batteries will be able to store up to two megawatt hours of power and deploy nearly half a megawatt as needed.

Ferrell, the VP at Sonnen, said his company's first Canadian project is just a demonstration, but he hopes it will pave the way for bigger ones.

In the United States, one of Sonnen's partners, Rocky Mountain Power, now has a growing VPP of 8,000 batteries that store up to 114 MWh and can supply 39 MW daily to the grid — similar in scale to Capital Power's 130-hectare solar farm, with 110,000 solar panels, in Strathmore, Alta.

That's still tiny compared with a 12 GW plant run by Oslo-based Statkraft that comprises more than 1,400 wind and solar installations in Germany. Billed as Europe's largest virtual power plant, it shows the potential huge scale of such networks.

WATCH | Taking on power outages with a giant battery in your home:

Kelly Tallas, co-founder and CEO of Calgary-based Solartility Group, said some countries in Europe have really implemented this kind of technology well.

So far in Canada, a hurdle to larger-scale projects is varying regulations among provinces, and most are designed to allow large generators to sell to the grid — not small, distributed energy sources. But Tallas said Alberta has started to allow ""micro"" generators, such as individual homes, to sell power to the grid through aggregators like Solartility. Harris, of Eguana Technologies, said there's also interest in this technology in British Columbia, Ontario and Nova Scotia.

Meanwhile, Calder said she's really happy with her system and would ""definitely recommend"" something similar to other families.

""The big thing for me is we produce power, we use our own power, we save our power and we give back power,"" she said. ""That is fantastic.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dL1cyIaEKiGWaS9Z3YhGhQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/a075c09765d14084f3b5ccf7830a97e2,N,,2025-09-07 19:01:53.979234

So what's missing?,admin,,,,,https://capitalethiopia.com/2025/09/07/young-africans-need-jobs-the-green-economy-needs-workers-so-whats-missing/,"Across the continent, green skills programmes are preparing graduates for formal careers in sectors like green hydrogen or utility-scale renewables.

And the ILO estimates that the green economy could create at least 3.3 million jobs across the continent by 2030.
Incentives for small-scale solar, vital for clean energy access and SME job creation, are missing, but the groundwork for a more inclusive green economy is being laid.
In Kenya, where the informal sector drives over 80% of employment, most green skills programmes still target the formal economy.","Climate High-Level Champion for COP29, Nigar Apadarai, calls for urgent alignment between youth skills, SME growth and climate ambition.

Across Africa, small businesses are already delivering climate solutions. They power homes, grow food, repair machinery, and manage waste. These are the kinds of enterprises that keep economies running; mostly informal, often climate-smart by necessity, and critical to everyday life. But they remain largely invisible in the ecosystem of climate policies, investment flows, and skills development required to shape the green economy.

At the same time, millions of young people are being trained for jobs that don’t yet exist. Across the continent, green skills programmes are preparing graduates for formal careers in sectors like green hydrogen or utility-scale renewables. These industries are vital to long-term climate goals, but in many countries, they are not yet creating employment at scale. Meanwhile, the businesses already hiring in climate-relevant sectors lack the support to grow.

The old saying that it is better to teach people to fish than to give them a fish has new relevance: the skills we teach will determine whether young people can seize the opportunities of a changing economy. The good news is that new delivery models — powered by the internet — mean skills can be rolled out faster and more affordably.

This week, as governments, investors and campaigners gather in Addis Ababa for the Africa Climate Summit, that disconnect is in sharp focus. The transition cannot succeed unless it creates jobs and livelihoods.

Each year, up to 12 million young Africans enter the workforce, yet only 3 million formal jobs are created, according to the Africa Development Bank. At the same time, more than 72 million young people are not in education, employment or training, the ILO reports, while many others are stuck in training pathways that don’t match employer demand. The result is a green economy that looks viable on paper, but remains disconnected from the realities of Africa’s labour markets.

The potential is there. SMEs already generate up to 80% of employment in many African economies, according to the International Finance Corporation. And the ILO estimates that the green economy could create at least 3.3 million jobs across the continent by 2030. But that will only happen if market conditions improve and, crucially, if the systems that shape climate delivery, enterprise growth, and skills development are aligned.

Right now, they are not. Climate and economic planning remain siloed; policy frameworks often prioritie large-scale industries and multilateral investment; skills systems are designed without meaningful employer input; and access to finance remains limited, particularly for small businesses operating in informal or decentralised sectors.

Positively, in July, Liberia launched Africa’s first Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Bank, supported by the African Development Bank, to tackle youth unemployment. It aims to finance 30,000 youth-led businesses, create 120,000 jobs, and unlock $500m in lending – with nearly half expected in the green economy.

In South Africa, the Just Transition Pathways study maps what a net zero economy needs – including 6-12 gigawatts of new renewables each year. That evidence base helped shape the Just Energy Transition Skills for Employment programme, which links training with real market demand and supports SME participation in sectors like solar and green hydrogen. Incentives for small-scale solar, vital for clean energy access and SME job creation, are missing, but the groundwork for a more inclusive green economy is being laid.

Elsewhere, momentum is building but is uneven. In Kenya, where the informal sector drives over 80% of employment, most green skills programmes still target the formal economy. In Ghana and Nigeria, renewable energy SMEs face financing barriers even as demand grows. Modular, work-integrated training, which allows young people to earn while they learn, is gaining traction as a way to scale both skills and opportunities, but progress must accelerate.

That’s why we need to refocus on delivery. First, by recognising SMEs as central to climate action and job creation. That means integrating them into national climate planning and removing policy barriers.

Second, by tying training to enterprise demand. Modular, job-embedded skills programmes, delivered through technical colleges and community-based providers, can help bridge the gap between training and employment. But they must be designed with employers, not just by administrators.

Third, by broadening the focus of climate finance. While large-scale projects remain essential, decentralised solutions and SME-led delivery offer faster returns in terms of both impact and employment. Investments in platforms, capacity-building, and supportive infrastructure are urgently needed.

This is the approach we are taking through the Climate-Proofing SMEs campaign, launched under my mandate as Climate High-Level Champion for COP29. So far it has engaged more than 45 collaborators and reached nearly 90 million SMEs in more than 100 countries. The campaign focuses on three priorities: helping large businesses strengthen climate-resilient supply chains by supporting SMEs to adopt climate action; mobilising finance from development banks, commercial leaders, and investors for SMEs in emerging economies; and equipping SMEs with practical tools to help them embed climate action into their operations.

Africa’s young people have the talent to lead the green economy. But they cannot do it alone. It’s time to build systems that align skills, finance and policy with the enterprises creating jobs today.

The moment to act is now.",https://capitalethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Labour-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 19:01:50.589542

The Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) has unveiled its first public EV battery-swapping station, offering an alternative to traditional charging that could make electric vehicle ownership easier, faster, and more affordable than ever.

The station, first launched at Bescom's KR Circle office, allows EV user to replace their depleted batteries with fully charged ones in just two minutes, according to the Deccan Herald. This pit stop-style station is as fast as grabbing a cup of coffee, unlike traditional charging, which takes a lot of time.

""This battery-swapping centre is a significant milestone in delivering fast, reliable, and accessible EV services to users in Bengaluru,"" said Dr. N. Shivashankar, managing director of Bescom. The project is a collaboration with IndoFast Energy, which already operates more than 250 swapping centres across India.

This innovation is just the beginning. Bescom has also announced plans to set up 20 additional stations across the city in the coming months.

This impressive innovation is not without its concerns. Many who are sceptical of EVs and their positive effects on the environment often point to the significant energy and resources that go into creating an EV battery.

While it's true that manufacturing an EV battery requires considerable energy and raw materials, this is only part of the story. Over the lifetime of the vehicle, EVs powered by clean energy dramatically reduce the release of polluting gases compared to gas-powered cars.

It is unclear at this time exactly how the Bescom battery replacement stages work on a procedural level. However, it seems as though they remove the battery, replace it with a charged one, and charge the removed battery themselves for a future battery swap. This is a great way to extend battery lifespans and enable reuse cycles.

Pairing EV ownership with home solar takes these advantages even further. Charging your vehicle with clean, self-generated solar power can slash fuel costs dramatically while cutting reliance on the grid.

From real estate and electric mobility to corporate transportation and tax advisory services, the impact of these changes is expected to be wide-ranging.

In the real estate sector, the reduction of GST on key construction materials like cement and steel is being viewed as a major boost.

Snehdeep Aggarwal, Founder & Chairman of Bhartiya Group, said, 'The reduction of GST on cement, steel and related construction materials is a timely and much-needed boost for the real estate sector. Lower input costs will allow developers to invest more in superior design, modern amenities, and sustainable practices, while ensuring greater affordability for homebuyers.'

'Corporate real estate too will benefit from improved cost efficiencies, making office and commercial projects more attractive for businesses and investors,' he added.

The reforms also address the corporate transport ecosystem, with a sharp cut in GST on commercial vehicles from 28 per cent to 18 per cent. This is expected to enhance the viability of vehicle ownership for driver-partners and improve the scalability of corporate commute programs.

Sriram Kannan, Founder & CEO of Routematic, said, 'The GST 2.0 reforms will significantly transform the corporate commute ecosystem in which Routematic operates. By reducing GST on commercial vehicles from 28 per cent to 18 per cent, more driver-partners will find it viable to purchase ICE vehicles at lower EMIs, boosting their earnings and livelihood security.'

In the electric vehicle (EV) space, keeping all EVs--across segments--within the 5% GST slab without cess is being viewed as a progressive, market-shaping move.

We’re not living in a natural outcome of human needs and behavior. The built environment as we know it—buildings and the spaces between—does direct damage to our minds. Land use planning has had devastating impacts on Americans: economically, socially, and culturally. But I’m not a doomer and I know these things are fixable. Not overnight reversible, but certainly fixable.

Copycat plans

Typical land use rules are written, updated, and enforced at the local government level. But as you might expect, agencies copied each other over the years because why wouldn’t they. Years ago, when I learned some photography techniques that were new to me, I made cheat sheets for other photographers. Much of what I’ve learned as an adult (podcasting, publishing, public speaking, etc.) has been taught by generous people who themselves had learned tips and tricks. So of course public agencies copied each other with their rule-making. “That worked for a similar river city? Let’s try it here.”

Planning departments at city and county levels weren’t setting out to guide development in a way that would purposefully harm people. Quite the opposite.

If a new Sears distribution center was coming to town, they’d want to map out a plan to accommodate all the new employees and subsequent traffic. In the middle of the 20th century, planners were still very much concerned about separating dirty and/or dangerous land uses from residential areas. The result was that all across the country, local development rules required or incentivized development patterns that spread everyone and everything across the landscape.

A work zone, school zone, shopping zone, entertainment zone, and a sleep zone were established. And then each major category started getting more prescriptive subcategories. “Residential” morphed into single-family, multi-family (apartments), and condos. But wait, there’s more! Residential land uses started to be regulated by local governments according to lot size: garden apartments, planned unit developments, and subdivisions were each given rules. Residential was also regulated by the type of people living in a place: public housing, group dwellings, age-restricted dwelling, renters, and owners.

Local regulations created (and continue to create) sprawl in cities, not just the suburbs.

The traffic factor

Land use planning requires traffic engineering analysis, a process prioritizing speedy car movement above all else. Wider roads and intersections are not just suggested but required with the express goal to move vehicular traffic from zone to zone as quickly as possible. This has been going on for nearly 100 years without taking a foot off the brake.

The obvious outcome of modern land use planning is that Americans drive everywhere all the time. Not just work commutes, but all the errands before, during, and after work. Half of our car trips are less than a few miles long. A quarter are less than one mile. Less than a mile in a car by ourselves.

The mental health connection

Life in a single-occupant vehicle has its perks, like singing along to music or listening to podcasts uninterrupted. It also has its pains, like separation from other humans and mental deterioration.

Loneliness is a significant variable affecting depression. It’s a predisposing factor. Cigna conducted a study of 20,000 Americans, and reported a jaw-dropping finding: nearly half of adults sometimes or always feel alone. 40% said their relationships aren’t meaningful and they feel isolated.

Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University. She says the health risks of missing out on social connection is like smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

Worse yet, there’s a causal relationship between social isolation and suicide. Conversely, having a crew (“social support” in doctor jargon) has a protective effect against suicide. For every suicidal death, another 20 people attempted suicide.

The takeaway

So what do you do with all this heavy information?

First, remember that the built environment is deliberately planned for us to drive in cars from zone to zone. Planners aren’t trying to destroy our minds, but the built environment increases anxiety, depression, isolation, loneliness, and suicide.

Second, understand the land use catastrophes are reversible. Compact development won’t be legalized overnight, but reform can come as quickly as local leaders are willing. Walk-friendly, bike-friendly, transit-friendly places are good medicine, and they’re made possible at the local level.

Third, and most important of all, know that things can get better in the end. America’s built environment does not fit who we are as humans, but we can turn this around with something as boring as reforming land use planning. Start by legalizing healthy infrastructure—a variety of land uses within walking distance of homes and streets designed for safe walking and cycling.

GM’s sudden shift comes as it prepares for what it calls “irrational” EV discounts to expire at the end of September.

GM cuts EV production as drastic discounts expire

GM sold over 21,000 electric vehicles in August, the most it has ever sold in a single month. Although that’s nearly double the 10,671 crosstown rival Ford sold last month, it apparently isn’t enough.

In a memo sent to employees, GM announced plans to reduce output at its Spring Hill, Tennessee, plant. A source close to the matter confirmed the news to Reuters, claiming GM will halt production of two Cadillac EVs, starting in December.

The Cadillac Lyriq and larger Vistiq, both of which are built at the facility, will see significantly less output during the first five months of 2026.

According to the source, GM plans to suspend one of its two shifts at the facility, resulting in layoffs for workers on the second shift.

In what could be even bigger news, the source said GM is delaying the start of a second shift at its Fairfax assembly plant outside of Kansas City “indefinitely,” where the new Chevy Bolt EV is scheduled to enter production later this year.

GM said it was “making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand.”

After reporting August sales numbers, the company said it expects to see strong EV demand in September, but after the $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of the month, it expects a slowdown in the fourth quarter.

“We are seeing marginal competitors dramatically scale back their products and plans, which should end much of the overproduction and irrational discounts,” GM said. Although it anticipates a smaller EV market, GM still believes it can grow its market share.

he news comes after GM announced last week that it plans to slow production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit.

Through the first eight months of the year, GM remains the second-best-selling EV maker, behind Tesla. The Chevy Equinox EV, or “America’s most affordable 315+ range EV,” is expected to be the third most popular EV in the US in 2025, trailing only the Tesla Model Y and Model 3.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GM-EV.webp,N,,2025-09-07 12:08:24.459750

Perched majestically on the Blue Nile River, this colossal dam promises to be a beacon of progress, development, and regional integration—provided it is managed with wisdom, foresight, and cooperation. For Ethiopia, the GERD represents not just a source of clean energy but a foundational pillar for economic growth and poverty alleviation. For the surrounding region, it offers unprecedented opportunities for stability, development, and shared prosperity. Yet, these immense benefits hinge critically on Ethiopia’s ability and willingness to harness the dam with judicious planning and equitable partnerships.

First and foremost, the GERD is poised to revolutionize Ethiopia’s energy sector. With an installed capacity exceeding 6,000 megawatts, it is set to double the nation’s current electricity production, dramatically expanding access to power for millions of Ethiopians who have hitherto lived without reliable electricity. Access to electricity is a cornerstone of modern development—it transforms education, healthcare, industry, and business. The dam’s energy output will catalyze industrialization, enabling Ethiopia to move beyond a primarily agrarian economy to a more diversified, manufacturing-led growth path. This in turn will create jobs, raise incomes, and expand the tax base that funds social services.

Moreover, the GERD’s capacity to deliver clean hydropower aligns perfectly with global imperatives to combat climate change. Ethiopia’s commitment to renewable energy advances a sustainable development model that mitigates reliance on fossil fuels while addressing its own environmental vulnerabilities. This strategic positioning could also attract climate-friendly investments and green finance, further accelerating national development.

Regionally, the GERD offers an opportunity to redefine water resource management on the Nile Basin. Historically, the Nile waters have been a source of tension among Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt, owing to complex colonial-era treaties and competing downstream needs. If managed transparently and collaboratively, the dam could shift these dynamics from conflict to cooperation. The regulated flow of water from the dam can reduce devastating floods downstream, provide reliable irrigation support to boost agricultural productivity, and ensure water availability during periods of drought. Sudan, for example, stands to benefit from reduced flood damage and improved electricity imports, creating incentives for constructive partnerships.

Equitable sharing of the GERD’s benefits, however, requires trust-building and clear frameworks for water management. Mechanisms that guarantee transparent data sharing on dam operations, flow rates, and reservoir levels will prove essential. Robust regional agreements must balance Ethiopia’s sovereign right to develop its resources with downstream states’ legitimate water needs. This spirit of cooperation could serve as a blueprint for transboundary water governance across Africa, fostering peace and shared prosperity.

The hydropower generated by GERD also has the potential to stimulate power trade across the Horn of Africa and beyond. Regional power pools can optimize electricity generation and distribution, stabilizing supply and lowering costs. For instance, surplus power from Ethiopia could be exported to energy-deficient neighbors, strengthening economic ties and building interdependence that undergirds political stability. Ambitious cross-border infrastructure projects — power lines, substations, and transmission corridors — will be crucial complements to GERD’s success.

Despite its promise, the dam is not without challenges that require prudent management. Environmental considerations near and around the reservoir must be carefully addressed to prevent negative ecological impacts. Resettlement of affected communities should be conducted with fairness and transparency to avoid social grievances. Furthermore, Ethiopia must invest substantially in its national electricity grid and distribution systems to maximize the dam’s benefits internally.

Financial sustainability is another key facet. While much of the initial funding has come from Ethiopian citizens and institutions, continued investment in maintenance and infrastructure is essential for long-term operation. Harnessing revenues from electricity sales to reinvest in infrastructure and community development will be fundamental.

Importantly, the GERD’s potential will only be fully realized if Ethiopia embraces inclusive governance and strategic planning. National-level policies must ensure that the dam’s benefits extend beyond urban centers to rural, underserved populations. Proactive capacity building in technical, managerial, and regulatory domains will optimize dam operations and water use efficiency.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam encapsulates the aspirations of a nation and a region for sustainable growth, energy security, and shared prosperity. It is a powerful symbol of how major infrastructure projects, when wisely stewarded, can unlock national potential and forge regional solidarity. By prioritizing transparent governance, regional cooperation, environmental stewardship, and inclusive development, Ethiopia can lead a transformative pathway for the Horn of Africa. The GERD is not just a dam — it is the cornerstone of a new era, the renaissance of Ethiopia and a hopeful testament to Africa’s ability to rise and thrive in the 21st century. The task ahead is immense, but so too are the rewards for Ethiopians and their neighbors if the journey is navigated with wisdom and unity.",https://capitalethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Editorial.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 14:01:10.483333

This partnership appears to seamlessly blend expertise to potentially create breakthrough developments in the energy sector. Innovation Crossroads, as per ORNL's programs, seems to not only provide rigorous technical support but also connect entrepreneurs to forge such collaborative efforts.

The crossroad of innovation and entrepreneurship is a well-traveled path for alumni of ORNL's specialized program. As Dan Miller of ORNL summarized, ""In addition to accessing world-class technical resources, Innovation Crossroads Fellows are connected with a peer network of early career energy and manufacturing entrepreneurs."" It points out a thriving ecosystem that's been cultivated in East Tennessee, one that has persuaded companies like SkyNano and Eonix to set down roots and expand their operations in the local community.

Still, manufacturers hope to make EV batteries even better through faster charging and longer lifespans.

A Norwegian University of Science and Technology research team may have found the key to doing just that by creating a new life-extending coating for lithium-sulfur batteries, reported Interesting Engineering.

Li-S batteries are the gold standard for EVs. They can charge faster and are generally safer than lithium-ion batteries.

However, because of the consistent movement of particles inside operating Li-S batteries, they wear out fast. That's a big problem for EV manufacturers prioritizing long-lasting batteries.

To fix this, the NTNU team developed and patented a coating that can potentially extend their lifespan by up to five times. By adding the coating to the battery's separator, which sits between its electrodes, the separator becomes a filter to reduce damage from chemicals moving within the battery.

The longer lifespan can translate to a lighter battery because its cells can store more energy without wearing out as quickly. This higher energy density requires fewer cells within the battery, resulting in a lighter weight.

According to Interesting Engineering, that could make a typical 800-volt EV battery about 440 pounds lighter. Lighter EVs have numerous benefits, including better handling, less tire wear, and extended battery range.

The research team believes this technology could work for other applications, too, such as amplifying the ability of batteries to store excess energy generated from home solar panels.

""The goal is to scale up the technology and license it to an industrial partner so that it can be used in everything from electric cars to storage of green energy,"" said Kristina Nydal, business developer at NTNU's Technology Transfer Office, per IE.

That means that if you use solar panels to charge your EV at home, you may get to eventually double-dip the benefits of this new technology if and when it goes mainstream.

Rotor Diameter: Landscapewise, it boasts the largest rotor diameter, which ranges from 260 to 292 meters (853 to 958 feet). This tremendous sweep area, which occupies an actual area of nine football fields, allows the turbine to harvest tremendous amounts of wind power.

Design Philosophy: The turbine is designed in a modular and lightweight format, which adds efficiency to the machine and also makes the transportation and installation easier.

Wind Speed Tolerance: As introduced earlier, the turbine is intended for medium- to high-wind speed regions, especially for typhoon-prone areas. It also has an active Anti-Typhoon System designed for Category 17 typhoons.

This editorial was authored by Tony Dearing, director of news operations.

You open your electric bill one month, and it’s $66. You think, OK, not bad. But the very next month, that cost has skyrocketed to $340.

Yikes!!!!!

There’s nothing like electricity to put the shock in sticker shock.

Those numbers are no exaggeration. To the dollar, that’s the 415% increase our reporter Katie Kausch saw in her July bill from JCP&L. She cited her own experience in an article asking New Jerseyans what they think about the staggering jump in electrical costs. Spoiler alert: They’re mad as hell.

So angry, in fact, that this issue may decide the election for governor, depending on who voters decide to blame.

If you’re looking for a culprit, you’ve got so many options.

The easiest target is PJM Interconnection, a regional organization that manages the power grid across the East Coast, including New Jersey, and plays a key role in setting wholesale prices for electricity.

PJM plodded along in obscurity for decades, setting electrical prices through an annual “capacity” auction.

Then came the 2024 auction, and the lid blew off.

Faced with voracious demand for electricity and a declining supply, the cost of securing a reliable supply of electricity across the region spiked to $14.7 billion, compared to $2.2 billion the previous year. That staggering cost is now being passed on to you as a consumer.

PJM says it’s just responding to market realities, and while it is by no means blameless, there are bigger players to be fingered here.

Tom Martello, our sage political columnist, recently called out the “two biggest elephants in the room” — Gov. Phil Murphy and President Donald Trump. Regardless of your political leanings, there’s blame to heap on either.

Here’s what it boils down to. Our traditional sources of electrical energy — such as coal and nuclear — are on the wane. One of our three nuclear plants shuttered in 2018, and New Jersey’s last remaining coal-burning power plants shut down in the early 2020s.

We need new ways to generate our own electricity, and it’s not happening nearly fast enough, leaving us overly reliant on power from elsewhere. We now know how cruel the cost of that can be.

Critics blame Murphy for staking New Jersey’s future too heavily on massive wind turbines proposed off the Jersey Shore, and then failing to deliver on that promise. His vision of N.J. as a center of wind energy tanked two years ago the Danish company Ørsted canceled its Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects due to inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain issues.

Then came Trump, who loathes clean energy projects like “windmills,” as he calls them. On his first day in office, he issued a memorandum designed to stall off-shore wind projects.

Trump has since removed federal subsidies for wind and solar, and as recently as last month, halted work on a wind farm nearing completion off the coast of Rhode Island.

Neither Murphy nor Trump is on the ballot in November, but their specter hangs over both candidates running for governor.

The Republican nominee, Jack Ciattarelli, is endorsed by Trump but finds himself doing a “delicate dance” as he deals with the unpopularity of Trump’s policies on Medicaid and immigration here in New Jersey.

Meanwhile, the Democratic hopeful, Mikie Sherrill, must distance herself from Murphy, whose popularity continues to decline by the day as he approaches the end of his second term.

Who will voters choose to punish this fall for the outrageous cost of electricity?

That’s the wrong question. What voters should ask themselves instead is, which candidate’s policies will give New Jersey the best chance of lowering electrical costs in the near future?

Because this problem has become so complex and intractable, you could be facing higher and higher electric bills for years to come.

We believe the best opportunity for lower electrical costs sooner lies in clean, renewable energy sources.

Maybe not wind turbines — despite New Jersey’s wind resources like its enviable sea breeze and proximity to the jet stream. Between Murphy’s failure to deliver and Trump’s antipathy, it would be hard to revive the momentum for offshore wind farms. And public support for that has been ebbing here in New Jersey anyway.

A Stockton poll last fall showed a narrow majority of New Jerseyans support offshore wind turbines, well down from the whopping 80% who favored wind power in 2019. And while only 26% strongly reject this idea, the opposition here is vocal and well-organized.

But other clean energy options, including solar and batteries, remain both viable and popular in the Garden State. In that same poll, a comfortable majority of state residents preferred renewable energy over fossil fuels, compared to the 37% who said fossil fuels are the better choice for increasing our energy supply.

Current state policy favors renewable energy, and now would be the wrong time to turn our back on that option. Other choices, be they fossil fuels or nuclear power, come with their own issues. And new plants powered by these sources can take anywhere from four years to a decade to get up and running.

Customers in New Jersey need relief from the high cost of electricity sooner than that. Solutions like solar and battery are less expensive and can typically be brought into production in a couple of years.

And that should be New Jersey’s choice. We don’t want our options dictated by climate deniers or others whose attitudes about energy are as fossilized and the fuels they favor. We need to chart our own course here.

If you want to know where the gubernatorial candidates stand on energy policy, you can get a detailed look by using our NJ Elections Chat tool on NJ.com. The at-a-glance answer is:

Ciattarelli wants to ban offshore wind, overhaul the state’s energy strategy and increase natural gas generation, which Murphy cut back on.

Sherrill wants to increase spending on solar and nuclear energy, modernize the natural gas infrastructure and vows a ban on any increase in the price of electricity next year.

But we encourage you to go deeper, and educate yourself on how each candidate proposes to approach this important pocketbook issue.

While we favor clean energy options, we understand that natural gas figures prominently in our current and future energy portfolio, and even those are only part of the answer on a public policy issue this complex and vexing.

More transparency and accountability are needed in the way PJM sets wholesale rates and around its epically dysfunctional permit process for getting new supplies of energy connected to the power grid.

And yes, the other elephant in the room is the proliferation of AI data centers that are sucking up massive amounts of electricity, which in turn drives up electrical cost that we now are paying through the nose for. We’ll take on these concerns in future editorials.

But in terms of energy policy, the future is now.

In this political season, electricity has become a lightning-rod issue. The choices that an angry electorate make in November will define where our power comes from and what it costs for years to come.

Clean, renewable energy is cheaper and could give us relief sooner. Why would New Jersey turn its back on that now when we need it more than ever?

Calling your elected representative in the state Assembly or Senate is the most effective way to influence policy. To find your state Assemblymember and Senator to voice your position, go to the New Jersey Legislature website’s Legislative Roster.

The new technology works by directing particle beams at stored atomic waste.
Fusion power combines deuterium and tritium atoms to create energy, just like the process that powers stars.

These innovations could help communities move away from pollution-heavy power sources and create jobs in emerging energy sectors.","American researchers have found a way to turn atomic waste materials into tritium, a necessary fuel for fusion reactors, reported Interesting Engineering.

This technology solves a pressing problem: America is sitting on thousands of tons of atomic waste from decades of nuclear power generation, but it must import all its tritium, a hydrogen isotope needed for fusion energy.

""Right now, the value of commercial tritium is about $15 million per pound [$33 million per kilogram], and the U.S. doesn't have any domestic capability to create it,"" explained Terence Tarnowsky, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, per IE.

The new technology works by directing particle beams at stored atomic waste. When atoms break apart, they create neutrons that eventually form tritium through a chain of reactions.

Unlike traditional reactors, workers can activate or deactivate the process as needed, which makes the process safer.

Computer simulations indicate a single reactor that consumes 1 billion watts could generate roughly 4.4 pounds of tritium each year. That's more than 10 times what comparable fusion systems might create.

Fusion power combines deuterium and tritium atoms to create energy, just like the process that powers stars. While deuterium exists in abundance in seawater, tritium is scarce. Canada's reactors currently produce most of the world's supply, and Earth's total inventory sits at just 55 pounds.

Nuclear power could help us meet our energy needs, but in its current state, it presents obstacles.

On one hand, fusion reactors could generate huge amounts of electricity with minimal radioactive by-products. Compare this to today's fission plants, which leave behind dangerous materials that need millennia of storage.

On the other hand, nuclear technology hurdles include high costs, safety concerns, and public skepticism about past accidents.

This recycling approach addresses the foremost concern by turning a costly burden into valuable fuel. Instead of paying billions to store radioactive materials for thousands of years, facilities could convert waste into tritium worth millions per pound while powering future clean energy systems.

If you support the advancement of clean energy solutions, consider contacting your representatives to discuss funding for fusion research and waste recycling technologies. These innovations could help communities move away from pollution-heavy power sources and create jobs in emerging energy sectors.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tritiumimage-recrKQqxFsC2NS0r4.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 13:03:53.584094

Increased EV competition accelerates the transition away from gas-powered vehicles, cutting pollution faster.
""The YU7 will outsell the Model Y because they have more tech and are priced lower to undercut the competition.","The world's best-selling electric vehicle has some competition. This month in China, Xiaomi unveiled its new YU7 electric SUV, positioned squarely against the Model Y with a lower price tag, competitive tech integrations, sleek, sporty design, and vibrant colors. Tesla's foothold at the top of the EV market is being seriously challenged — and consumers should pay attention.

""In China, the Model Y is already feeling the impact of Xiaomi's YU7,"" reported Electrek.

Xiaomi's CEO Lei Jun is not mincing words when it comes to his goal for the company. Xiaomi ""has set a goal for the YU7 to outsell the Tesla Model Y, the best-selling electric premium SUV, in China,"" reported Electrek in June.

As YU7 orders skyrocket, Model Y purchases are falling. This mimics the performance of Xiaomi's first EV, which is comparable to the Model 3 and has outsold its Tesla counterpart since its release.

For buyers, this competition could be a win. Xiaomi's YU7 reportedly undercuts the Model Y on price while offering similar features. That kind of innovation forces Tesla to either drive down costs or significantly improve quality for customers worldwide. Greater choice at more competitive prices is exactly what EV shoppers want, especially in a time when affordability is a major barrier to widespread EV adoption.

Increased EV competition accelerates the transition away from gas-powered vehicles, cutting pollution faster. Increased production also requires more and more batteries and mineral mining, but the mining needed for the clean energy transition is a fraction of what is done annually for the oil industry.

Ultimately, Tesla's battle with Xiaomi signals a changing EV landscape. Consumers are hungry for a growing market, and China offers one of the most competitive car markets in the world.

""There are numerous cars coming out of the woodwork there regularly,"" wrote one commenter. ""The YU7 will outsell the Model Y because they have more tech and are priced lower to undercut the competition. This is what all competitors in China have to deal with, not just Tesla. It will be interesting to see who is still selling cars in China in a few years.""

""For the last 5 years, the American automaker enjoyed some dominance in the Chinese market, but now local companies have caught up and Xiaomi is one of the best examples,"" said Electrek.

A Case Study in Short-Termism Politicizing projects like Revolution Wind serves no one’s long-term interests.
Conclusion In the end, the decision to halt Revolution Wind is a case study in how political short-termism can sabotage economic rationality.","The abrupt halt of Ørsted’s Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island has become one of the most striking examples yet of political interference derailing sound economic logic. This was not a struggling venture or a risky experimental bet. It was a nearly complete, multi-billion-dollar project designed to deliver clean power to more than 350,000 households. Eighty percent of the turbines were already in place, the investment had largely been sunk, and the project had a clear pathway to profitability. Yet the U.S. government ordered a stop, citing vague national security concerns. The decision has rattled markets, hammered Ørsted’s stock, and left observers questioning how reliable the American policy environment is for large-scale energy investments.

Economic Sense, Political Nonsense

For Ørsted, the project represented both a cornerstone of its U.S. ambitions and a test case for its ability to scale offshore wind in one of the world’s most important energy markets. For the United States, Revolution Wind was more than a power plant, it was a strategic infrastructure project. It promised to strengthen grid reliability in New England, diversify the regional energy mix, and provide a secure, local source of electricity at competitive prices. Jobs were created, supply chains were mobilized, and construction was already transforming the landscape. In every respect, the economics of the project made sense not just for Ørsted and its partners, but also for the communities and consumers who stood to benefit from it.

Signals to Investors

The logic of halting such a project is difficult to reconcile. At a time when global capital is increasingly cautious about deploying billions into long-term infrastructure, the United States had successfully attracted one of the world’s leading offshore wind developers. Years of regulatory approvals had been navigated, financing secured, and state-level political support firmly in place. To pull the plug so late in the process, with billions already spent and the project nearly ready to deliver power, sends a chilling signal to investors: no matter how advanced a project may be, no matter how rigorous the permitting process, politics can still override economics at the final stage.

Offshore Wind Is No Gamble

This is particularly damaging because offshore wind is not a fringe technology. In Europe, it is already a backbone of the energy system, delivering reliable power at scale. Costs have fallen sharply over the past decade, making it one of the most competitive forms of renewable generation. Revolution Wind was structured with long-term power purchase agreements, providing predictable revenue and stable returns. Its role in stabilizing the New England grid had been recognized by regional operators. By almost any measure, this was exactly the type of project that energy economists point to when they talk about the viability of renewables.

Ørsted’s Losses, America’s Losses

The consequences for Ørsted have been severe. Already under pressure from rising global costs and earlier project delays, the company saw its market value tumble to historic lows after the halt was announced. Its ability to raise new capital, including an emergency injection to stabilize its balance sheet, has been thrown into question. For a company once held up as a global leader in the energy transition, the setback is dramatic, threatening to undermine its broader U.S. growth strategy.

A Chill Across the Market

Yet the impact extends far beyond a single company. For the United States, halting Revolution Wind represents a lost opportunity to reinforce energy security with a domestic, low-carbon resource. Instead, New England will remain more reliant on natural gas imports and on an aging grid that is increasingly strained by extreme weather events. Consumers are likely to face higher costs and greater volatility as a result. And perhaps most significantly, the decision undermines America’s credibility as a destination for energy investment. If even projects that are 80 percent complete can be stopped on political whim, why would any global developer commit billions to the next offshore wind farm, or to hydrogen hubs, or to long-duration storage?

Geopolitics or Ideology?

Some have speculated that the halt may have less to do with the project itself and more to do with geopolitics. Denmark, Ørsted’s home country, has clashed with Washington in the past over issues ranging from Arctic policy to Greenland. Others see the decision as part of a broader ideological push against renewable energy from the current U.S. administration. Whatever the true motives, the result is the same: an erosion of trust in the stability of U.S. policymaking.

The Transition Will Not Stop

The irony is that stopping Revolution Wind will not halt the energy transition. Global momentum behind renewables continues, driven by economics as much as by climate goals. The cost trajectory of wind and solar, combined with storage, makes them increasingly competitive against fossil fuels. Demand from corporations and states for clean power remains strong, regardless of federal policy swings. What the halt does accomplish, however, is to delay the U.S. in securing its share of that momentum. Other regions will move faster, attract more capital, and develop the industries and jobs that come with leadership in clean energy.

A Case Study in Short-Termism

Politicizing projects like Revolution Wind serves no one’s long-term interests. It undermines investor confidence, discourages innovation, and deprives consumers of cost-effective power. For the U.S. economy, it risks leaving the country less competitive in the industries of the future. For the global climate effort, it removes a project that would have delivered meaningful emissions reductions. And for companies like Ørsted, it reinforces the perception that the U.S. is not a reliable partner for long-horizon energy infrastructure.

Conclusion

In the end, the decision to halt Revolution Wind is a case study in how political short-termism can sabotage economic rationality. Here was a project that ticked every box: nearly finished, financially sound, socially beneficial, and strategically important. Instead of celebrating its completion, the U.S. government chose to halt it, leaving investors and partners bewildered. The damage will be felt for years, not only by Ørsted, but by every energy company now rethinking whether America is a safe place to bet on the future.

But you've got a very narrow window here in northern Minnesota between when trees drop their leaves and when the ground freezes.","NARY, Minn. — Brian Ingmire’s mission to help reforest northern Minnesota with trees from south of here became a lot more important after the June 21 storm that leveled millions of trees in the Bemidji area.

Ingmire and his wife, Trina, own the 10-acre New North Farm southeast of Bemidji in Hubbard County. They sell Certified Naturally Grown produce at Bemidji’s Natural Choice Farmers Market on Saturdays. They also raise sheep and chickens.

Brian is a member of the Farm & Forest Growers Cooperative, a network of small farms and nurseries that grow climate-adaptive tree seeds into seedlings, and then sell the seedlings to reforestation agencies and individuals.

“Minnesota has a massive need for tree seedlings,” Ingmire said. “Something like 10 million trees are needed every year at a minimum. And we have a lot of forest disturbance, whether it’s fires or wind events.”

Ingmire figures he has about 30,000 tree seedlings on his farm, and about two-thirds of them will be available for purchase this fall. Online orders can be placed at climatesmarttrees.com. He's also been selling seedlings at his Bemidji Natural Choice Farmers Market booth, and says having them there gives him an opportunity to talk about the project.

New North Farm is one of 24 members of the cooperative. Ingmire is growing several varieties, including red oak, burr oak, yellow birch and silver maple. All are collected from about 200 miles south and then started up north.

“I can tell you where their parent tree came from,” Ingmire said. “They should be able to handle the changes in temperature extremes. We’ve got different insect pests and fungal pests that are putting stressors on trees just because of the temperature extremes. These trees should have the genetic ability to deal with that kind of extreme.”

The need for reforestation was certainly exacerbated in the Bemidji area after the June storm. It is estimated that Beltrami County lost nine million trees, and many were also downed in parts of Hubbard and Cass counties.

“That number exceeds a lot of the nursery capacity that we have,” Ingmire said.

Trees that are purchased this fall should be planted right away to ensure their survival.

“Most of our sales will be done for spring planting,” Ingmire said, “but I would like to see as many available in the fall as possible. I think the trees do better when they're planted in the fall. But you've got a very narrow window here in northern Minnesota between when trees drop their leaves and when the ground freezes. Some years you've got a month to get all that done, and some years you've got two weeks.”

Listening to Ingmire talk about the seedling program, his gardens and forest ecology, it’s clear to see his passion for science and the environment.

""In a lot of ways it’s a spiritual thing for me,"" he said. ""You either set everything aside and you take a preservationist mindset where nature's best left without man touching it, or you recognize that we as humans have a unique role and responsibility to participate and be part of the natural world. There's really no separation between the two of them.""

He noted that the impacts humans have are global, but that these impacts start on a local level.

""One tree at a time, or one farm that's growing vegetables that feed people. So you can choose to participate in a lot of different ways,"" Ingmire said. ""The way that I choose to participate is to imagine and envision what it could be, and then work to model that and make it happen. And help other people do the same.""

Ingmire's full-time job is with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture as a water certification specialist. It’s a position that allows for flexibility, especially during the growing season, and it also allows him to visit with farmers throughout the region.

He has a degree in natural resources and environmental maintenance from Ball State University in his native Indiana. He did graduate work at Western Kentucky University and Indiana University before becoming a science teacher at the junior college and high school level.

After that, he managed water quality programs for the Environmental Protection Agency and spent 13 years as a conservation planner and trainer with the United States Department of Agriculture.

The Ingmires moved to Minnesota nearly four years ago after he started his current position with the MDA. But finding the right place to live was a bit of a challenge for Brian and Trina.

“It was right in the middle of COVID,” Brian said. “Interest rates were starting to go up. Everybody was racing to get a place.”

The couple had planned to visit five properties in the Bemidji area, but by the time they arrived, three of them had been sold.

“The first one we looked at was just a nightmare,” Brian said. Even the farm they bought didn’t look right when they pulled into the snow-covered driveway.

“It looked horrible,” Brian said. “We didn’t have any photos of the inside of the house. The doors were open on the sheds when we pulled in. It hadn’t been plowed. But then we got into the house and it had a bank of south-facing windows and all the sun was shining through. We thought, ‘This is it. We can do this.’”

Fast forward four years, and Brian and Trina have created a pristine and productive farm, with a lot of sweat equity and a little help from their hungry sheep.

“I was looking at soil maps and thought it should be good,” Brian said. “It’s prime agricultural land. We had a lot of little surprises when everything thawed. There were piles of trash, it was all grown over and full of boxelder. Kind of daunting, but I was ready for it. I was just ready to have my own piece of land, and I had ideas I wanted to try out.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/6270a4e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x4284+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F20%2Fa80e09dd49a3ae86822b44a6ae3b%2Fingmire2.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 14:01:19.441352

But the city’s green goals have also drawn a critical eye from Florida’s Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, which is auditing the city alongside several other local governments across the state.
In his recent State of the City speech, Mayor Buddy Dyer said that the city was on track to run city facilities with solar by early 2027 — an initiative he said boasts environmental and economic benefits.
Solar is a good investment for cities like Orlando because city workers will occupy their buildings for long periods of time, he said.
City staffers leading the city’s green initiatives were also interviewed by DOGE auditors when they visited City Hall last month, an official said.","Orlando is on the verge of powering its municipal buildings entirely by renewable energy, and is on pace to reach that goal three years ahead of schedule.

In his recent State of the City speech, Mayor Buddy Dyer said that the city was on track to run city facilities with solar by early 2027 — an initiative he said boasts environmental and economic benefits.

“Yes, this is about fighting climate change. But it’s also about saving money and increasing operational efficiency,” Dyer said. “It’s an up-front investment that pays for itself over time, and then generates a return in dollars, jobs and other tangible benefits.”

The city council first set the goal in 2017, alongside a larger target of powering the entire city with renewable sources by 2050. Other cities, like Burlington, Vermont and Aspen, Colorado, have entirely renewable electrical grids, though Dyer has strived to position Orlando as the most sustainable city in the southeast.

The city’s solar investments also continue, with about 10 new systems expected to be added by the end of 2026 on buildings ranging from community centers to fire stations to the city’s fleet and facilities headquarters.

Between now and the third quarter of 2026, that’s about a $4 million investment, said Mike Hess, the city’s director of sustainability, resilience and future-ready.

At the city’s fleet and facilities building — where employees maintain, repair and replace a range of vehicles and equipment like police cars and solid waste trucks — the new solar system will produce more energy than is used there, Hess said.

Solar is a good investment for cities like Orlando because city workers will occupy their buildings for long periods of time, he said. New solar systems are expected to last about 25 years, and should be entirely paid off in 10 years, meaning taxpayers would reap savings for 15 years.

“If we’re installing roughly $4 million in solar projects … 10 years from now, our taxpayers are going to start to see a $400,000 per year savings on our energy bills,” Hess said.“Ten-year paybacks are great for us because we’re going to own our buildings for a long, long time.”

These investments come as NASA confirmed 2024 was the warmest year recorded, which scientists have blamed on carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, which trap heat.

Environmental policies, however, have been some of the biggest targets of Florida DOGE, which Gov. Ron DeSantis and CFO Blaise Ingoglia has characterized as looking for waste and inefficiency but has included scouring records for phrases it deems ideologically suspect.

In its letter demanding a slew of records, DOGE asked the city to turn over documents and data about any “Green New Deal” policies related to climate change, carbon reduction, as well as capital and operating expenses of any such programs.

The Green New Deal itself was a 2019 proposal from U.S. Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. that did not advance in Congress and has no connection with local environmental initiatives such as Orlando’s.

City staffers leading the city’s green initiatives were also interviewed by DOGE auditors when they visited City Hall last month, an official said.

Despite the increase in solar usage, the Orlando Utilities Commission, which is city-owned, still relies on coal at its Stanton Energy Plant — at least for now. The utility intends to phase out coal and natural gas by 2050 in favor of solar and renewable sources. It announced in 2020 it would stop burning coal there in 2027 and switch to natural gas.

City leaders have also sought to reduce the energy needed to power its facilities by 20% since 2011. The city issued a $17.5 million bond to cover 55 projects across the city, including switching lights to LED, replacing HVAC systems with more energy-efficient models and automating buildings with smart systems to control usage. Such upgrades were done at the Kia Center, City Hall, fire stations, community centers and other facilities.

Dyer said the results were $2.5 million in annual energy savings.

The automaker unveiled the plan at its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant, where the new model will be built starting in 2027, Electrek revealed. The electric truck will be the first vehicle based on Ford's new ""Universal EV Platform,"" which is designed to provide more interior space and lower ownership costs compared with competitors like Tesla's Model Y.

The announcement came with surprises. Ford said it will discontinue the Escape, its second-best-selling SUV, and the Lincoln Corsair after the 2026 model year. Both models are currently built at the Louisville facility, which will be repurposed to produce the new generation of affordable EVs.

Ford has invested about $5 billion into the plant, creating nearly 4,000 jobs in preparation for this shift. The company says the new truck will be part of a family of lower-cost EVs that are expected to expand consumer access to clean transportation.

Electric vehicles are gaining traction worldwide as automakers push out new models at lower price points. EVs save drivers money by eliminating oil changes and many fluid replacements, cutting fuel costs, and reducing long-term maintenance. They also operate with quieter engines and produce no tailpipe pollution. Drivers can explore how to make their next car an EV with more resources available for first-time buyers.

Some critics point to the environmental impact of mining for lithium and other minerals used in batteries. Research shows the clean energy transition requires about 30 million tons of minerals each year, but the world currently extracts about 16.5 billion tons of dirty energy annually, which is burned and cannot be reused, unlike battery materials — so electric is still better for the planet.

Studies also show EVs quickly pay off their environmental footprint — a Tesla Model 3 offsets its manufacturing costs after just 13,500 miles compared with a Toyota Corolla, according to Reuters.

The benefits grow when EVs are paired with home solar panels, which lower charging costs even further. Fueling with solar energy is cheaper than using public stations or the grid, and EnergySage makes it easy to compare local installer quotes and save up to $10,000 on installations.

GET THE LATEST BREAKING NEWS HERE -- SIGN UP FOR GOLOCAL FREE DAILY EBLAST

Republican Rhode Island Governor Don Carcieri was a conservative, pro-business politician. Socially, he was opposed to gay marriage and abortion.

First elected in 2002, Carcieri promised to cut state government and create 20,000 jobs.

His two terms were bumpy as he often clashed with the Democratic legislature.

In Carcieri’s final years, he pushed two major economic development strategies. The first economic development initiative involved a funding scheme that provided $75 million to 38 Studios, a video game company founded by former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling.

That was an almost immediate failure, with the company going into bankruptcy in less than two years after Carcieri and the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) pushed through the massive public spending for the fledgling company. The investment, bankruptcy, and legal actions made Rhode Island national news. It was an abject embarrassment.

The second Carcieri initiative was to create an offshore wind industry in Rhode Island. Massachusetts had first attempted to build an offshore wind project in America, but powerful interests, including U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, the Koch brothers, and even Walter Cronkite, opposed the Cape Wind project.

The offshore wind industry began in earnest in Rhode Island in 2008, as Carcieri pushed through legislation to start the wind industry in the state.

It took almost a decade, and the first successful project in America was Deepwater Wind.

The Beginning - Big Goals

In September of 2008, Carcieri announced that Deepwater Wind was chosen as the developer to construct a wind energy project off the shores of Rhode Island that could provide 1.3 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity per year, 15 percent of all electricity used in the state. It was expected that the project would cost more than $1 billion to construct, with all the capital coming from private investment sources.

“Today marks a major step to bring wind power to Rhode Island and to reach our goal of at least 15 percent of all electricity in the state be renewable energy,” Carcieri said at the time. “Of the many forms of renewable energy alternatives available, wind is the proven leader. Wind power is clean, green power that is not subject to variations and increases in fuel prices. Rhode Island is uniquely positioned to lead the nation with the development of this country’s first offshore wind farm.”

Democratic Opposition

The lead opponent to the project was the Democratic Rhode Island Attorney General.

In July of 2010, GoLocal reported that Attorney General Patrick Lynch took his opposition to the proposed wind farm off Block Island to the next level, announcing he was challenging the constitutionality of a new law that allowed the project to move forward.

As reported, the law would send the issue back to the Public Utilities Commission, which had already once turned down a proposed contract between National Grid and Deepwater Wind, After the law took effect, Deepwater Wind filed a new proposed contract with the PUC.

“We continue to fight against this special-interest measure and inside deal tailored to put only one entity, Deepwater Wind, on the fast track to develop a costly demonstration project that isn’t needed and will create only six full-time jobs,” said Lynch, who at the time was a Democratic candidate for governor.

“It’s an exercise in futility that will not spur economic development in Rhode Island, will not generate much-needed jobs for our residents in a cutting-edge industry and, despite its supporters’ promises, provides absolutely no guarantee that our state will rise as the primary purveyor of affordable wind energy along the Atlantic coast,"" Lynch added.

Charges of Inside Deal

Carcieri hammered away at Lynch for saying the new law was “an inside deal” tailored to favor just one company—Deepwater Wind.

“The Attorney General is making a reckless charge that the new law was the result of an inside deal tailored to favor one developer,” said Carcieri at the time. “The Attorney General should know that there was a competitive process to select a preferred developer for the proposed wind farm. The process was open, transparent, and based on competitive scoring of all interested applicants.”

Carcieri said Deepwater Wind was chosen because it had the lowest energy price, the strongest financial assets, and could commit to creating jobs in Rhode Island.

“The Attorney General is either uninformed or misleading the public – which is it?” Carcieri concluded.

The project was ultimately cut down to a pilot project located off Block Island.

After a battle to get the pilot project approved, Deepwater was off and running, but faced challenges, including financing, legal, and local zoning.

In May of 2017, Block Island switched over and was powered by Deepwater — making American history.

The success of the project made global news, and the Block Island project was featured in a national Citi ad.

Today, the success of Deepwater seems forgotten, and the offshore wind industry is mired in political and legal chaos.

It all started in Rhode Island.

The SPEED Act takes aim at the scientific foundation of environmental review

By guest contributor Justin Pidot.

On September 10, the House Natural Resources Committee will convene a hearing on the SPEED Act—the latest NEPA reform bill championed by Chairman Bruce Westerman. The bill includes provisions that would fundamentally compromise the integrity of federal decision making processes by allowing—or even compelling—the government to ignore scientific and technical information critical to understanding the effects of a federal action and how those effects could be mitigated.

This component of the SPEED Act would operate against the backdrop of a provision Congress added to NEPA in 2023 to limit an agency’s obligation to generate new information. NEPA section 106 (b)(3), which addresses the threshold question of whether to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS), provides an agency:

“is not required to undertake new scientific or technical research unless the new scientific or technical research is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives, and the overall costs and time frame of obtaining it are not unreasonable.”

This approach to new information strikes a balance, an appropriate one in my view, between analytical integrity and efficiency. The SPEED Act would obliterate that balance by providing that an agency is also not required:

“to undertake new scientific and technical research after the receipt of an application, as applicable, with respect to such proposed agency action.”

If you’re scratching your head trying to parse the language precisely, you’re in good company. I think the convoluted text running from “receipt” to “proposed agency action” describing the covered circumstances simply means whenever an agency receives an application, but maybe there’s a nuance I’m missing.

But that text certainly seems to provide that where it applies, an agency never needs to perform scientific or technical research, no matter how essential or reasonably obtained.

The SPEED Act would add even more capacious (and clearer) provisions to section 107—which addresses conducting environmental reviews—providing:

“no Federal agency shall be required to consider any scientific or technical research that becomes publicly available” after the agency has received an application or published a notice of intent (NOI) to prepare an environmental document, whichever comes sooner; and

“[a] Federal agency may not delay the issuance of an environmental document or a final agency action . . . on the basis of awaiting new scientific or technical information.”

One consequence of those provisions is that they would allow agencies to entirely ignore information provided during public comment periods, including a provision of the 2023 NEPA amendments requiring agencies to take comment on NOIs—which, by definition, occur after the NOI is published.

It is Orwellian indeed to require an agency to seek input from the public that the agency is expressly excused from having to consider. And if you’re wondering if this is an intended consequence, it clearly is, because the bill specifies that permitting agencies to ignore information in environmental review processes does not affect their obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act to respond to comment when issuing or revising regulations.

So far, I’ve talked about the consequences of the SPEED Act in abstract terms. Here’s a concrete example of two agencies developing essential information that would be compromised: In 2003, the BLM and Forest Service commenced an EIS for a proposal to expand a phosphate mine in Idaho and dispose of toxic waste from the expansion at a site nearby. Evaluating the risk of contaminating streams, rivers, and groundwater in the area required information about the geology of the disposal site. But as is typical, that kind of detailed site-specific information didn’t exist when the environmental review process began. So, during the EIS process (which concluded in 2006), more than 50 bore holes were drilled to characterize the geochemistry of the site. Information from that research enabled development of a new alternative in the final EIS with improved engineering of the disposal site. That alternative, enabled by research occurring during the environmental review, was ultimately adopted.

This kind of circumstance isn’t unusual. The environmental review process often involves some degree of research on the:

natural resources occurring in a project area

amount of air pollution a project will generate, where it will end up, and how that may impact people’s health

fate of oil or chemicals released in an accident and how they could be contained

area’s risks of wildfire, flood, earthquake or other natural disasters; and

hydrology of the area and how a project could pollute drinking water or reduce water supply.

Developing information about those kinds of things is central to the NEPA process and can often be done quickly and affordably.

The SPEED Act’s approach would have further, and I suspect unintended, consequences: It would encourage development in locations where we know less about the environment; and it would encourage the use of less tested technologies and methods. That’s because analysis would only be required to the extent that technical and scientific information is already available. In other words, if we know nothing, no analysis needs to occur.

By calcifying scientific and technical information at the moment an agency receives an application, or publishes an NOI, the SPEED Act would enable the government to turn a willfully blind eye to inconvenient information about harms to human health, air and water quality, biodiversity, and other aspects of the human environment. That’s a recipe for ill-conceived decisions, not better government.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NEPA-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 11:01:33.360291

Automakers can chase longer range, but that drives up cost. They can make the battery charge very rapidly, but that can shorten its lifespan. Push too far in one direction and something else inevitably gives.

To make a battery that’s great at all those aspects is tough, but automakers and battery companies have signed up for the challenge regardless, thanks to solid-state batteries.

If solid-state batteries are manufactured at scale, they can offer an ideal balance of range, safety, performance and fast-charging in a similar or a smaller pack size. There’s a reason why scientists call it the “holy grail” of battery technology.

These batteries replace the liquid electrolyte, the chemical that facilitates the charge and discharge cycles, with a solid one. The solid materials theoretically perform better, but they’re difficult to manufacture in large volumes without defects.

Even if battery companies succeed, they won’t turn things around overnight. Research firm BloombergNEF projects solid-state batteries to account for just 10% of global EV and battery storage demand by 2035. The exact path to scalability and commercialization still looks murky, and the initial rollout could be concentrated in premium EVs.

In the meantime, semi-solid-state batteries are gaining traction. These batteries use a gel-like electrolyte that also promises improvements over traditional lithium-ion batteries. Chinese battery companies have established a firm lead in this space, with 83% of current or planned solid-state battery manufacturing capacity all concentrated in China, BNEF said.

EVs with semi-solid-state batteries are already rolling out in China, albeit in small numbers. Customers can buy and drive them today, thanks to early adopters such as Nio and the state-backed SAIC Motors that invested in the tech early. In the West, Mercedes-Benz and BMW are testing solid-state batteries, and Stellantis is planning to begin trials next year.

Japanese and Korean automakers are also working on this tech, but they’ve been tight-lipped about their plans. In 2022, Nikkei reported that Toyota held the highest number of solid-state battery patents, followed by Panasonic and Idemitsu.

In this list, we’re covering both semi-solid-state and all-solid-state batteries. Some of these EVs are already on the market in China, while others are planned to go on sale in the coming years. A few of them are demo cars, but we’re including them in the list anyway. We’re also including automakers that have not yet installed solid-state batteries in an actual EV, but have shown the intent to do so. The list covers both Chinese EVs as well as some Western models that are in the works.

Nio ET7/ET5

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Energy Density: 360 watt hours per kilogram

Supplier: Beijing WeLion New Energy Technology

Claimed Range: 652 miles (1,050 kilometers)

In late 2023, Nio’s Founder, Chairman, and CEO William Li got behind the wheel of the sleek ET7 sedan and drove more than 648 miles on a single charge. He did that in real-world conditions and, moreover, in frigid temperatures, the automaker claimed. The ET7 was equipped with a 150 kWh semi-solid-state battery, which is available to rent for Nio EV owners in China for a per-day fee. It’s a great idea: Do your daily driving using the brand's small 70-75 kWh packs and switch to solid-state via battery swapping before long road trips.

IM Motors L6

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Supplier: Suzhou QingTao Power Technology

Range: 620+ miles (1,000 km)

IM Motors is the luxury arm of China’s state backed SAIC Motors. SAIC has made a significant headway into semi-solid-state batteries with multiple models on sale already in China.

The IM L6 rivals the Tesla Model 3 and the Xiaomi SU7. Its entry-level versions get lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, but it’s also available with a 133 kWh semi-solid-state pack that’s good for more than 620 miles of range on the China Light-Duty Test Cycle (CLTC). A 900-volt architecture makes adding 248 miles of range in just 12 minutes of charging possible, with a powerful enough charger. It’s priced between 230,000 and 330,000 yuan ($28,000-$45,600).

MG4

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Energy Density: 180 Wh/kg

Supplier: Suzhou QingTao Power Technology

British carmaker MG Motor is another SAIC owned brand benefitting from semi-solid-state batteries. MG made waves recently by announcing the launch of the first affordable mass market EV powered by a semi-solid-state battery later this year. The battery size and range are still unknown, but MG said the cells use only 5% liquid electrolyte. The prices look competitive, too. The MG4 is available with both LFP and semi-solid state batteries, costing between 73,800 and 105,800 yuan ($10,100-14,400).

Voyah Passion (Locally called Voyah Zhuiguang)

Voyah Passion/Zhuiguang

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Range: 360 miles

Voyah, the premium brand under China’s Dongfeng Motor Corporation, launched the Passion sedan in China in 2023 in both plug-in hybrid and battery-electric versions. Its 82 kWh semi-solid-state battery is installed in the entry-level version, whereas the 109 kWh lithium-ion battery is the one with significantly more range, as per local news reports. The 82 kWh pack is good for 360 miles of CLTC range, whereas the bigger pack can deliver 453 miles. It's priced between 322,900 and 432,000 yuan ($45,000-$60,000).

The semi-solid state pack was an early generation of the battery, and the automaker is reportedly working on its third generation solid-state tech.

China’s DongFeng Motor Corporation started testing semi-solid-state batteries way back in 2022. At that time, the automaker installed semi-solid-state batteries in 50 prototype E70 electric sedans. The pack was developed in collaboration with battery company Ganfeng, and also supports swapping, local media said at the time.

In August, the automaker said the commercial production of the semi-solid-state battery would begin in 2026. And it would deliver a range of over 620 miles.

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Energy Density: 375 Wh/kg

Supplier: Factorial Energy

Stellantis and Massachusetts-based battery startup Factorial have validated a semi-solid-state battery cell with a claimed energy density of 375 watt hours per kilogram, which is more than the typical 200-300 Wh/kg energy density of traditional lithium-ion batteries. The automaker claims the cells can charge from 15-90% in 18 minutes at room temperature. It has a discharge rate of up to 4C, meaning it can fully discharge four times in an hour. The battery will be tested on a demo fleet of Charger Daytona EVs next year, Stellantis has said.

Factorial is also supplying semi-solid-state batteries to Mercedes-Benz. Earlier this year, the automaker showcased a prototype EQS equipped with Factorial’s semi-solid-state battery, claiming it could deliver 25% more range without increasing the size or the weight of the pack. The current EQS has a battery capacity of roughly 118 kWh. Factorial expects mass production to begin by the end of the decade.

Battery type: All-solid state

Energy Density: 390 Wh/kg

Supplier: Solid Power

BMW started testing a prototype i7 powered by all-solid-state cells in Munich this summer. It’s using prismatic cells developed by Colorado-based battery start-up Solid Power. The automaker didn’t share the size of the pack, but said it would begin making the cells on a pilot production line in Germany by licensing Solid Power’s technology. Crucial information such as estimated range is missing, but it’s probably too early for that.

Automakers With Plans To Launch Solid-State Batteries

Toyota

2019 Toyota LQ concept

Toyota put a solid-state battery in the futuristic-looking LQ prototype way back in 2021, way before the technology started making weekly news headlines. It expects its first solid-state battery to enter mass production in the 2027-2028 period.

The automaker claims that its solid-state battery will deliver more than 620 miles of range. And it could charge from 10-80% in less than 10 minutes. However, we’re likely to see a solid-state battery in a Toyota hybrid before an EV. Gill Pratt, Toyota’s chief scientist and head of the Toyota Research Institute, confirmed that in 2022.

That makes perfect sense. Toyota hybrids are as popular as ever, and if the RAV4 or Prius can double their electric-only driving range, it’s a win for the brand and also for the climate.

Honda

Honda is working independently to develop an all-solid-state battery, which it intends to install in production vehicles sometime in the second half of this decade. The automaker said last year that its solid-state cells could potentially be 50% smaller, 35% lighter and 25% cheaper than current lithium-ion batteries.

It expects a driving range exceeding 620 miles, which could increase to over 700 miles over time. It’s currently testing the battery on a pilot production line in Japan, ironing out issues related to mass production.

Volkswagen

The Volkswagen Group is working closely with California-based battery startup QuantumScape to develop all-solid-state batteries. Its battery subsidiary PowerCo has invested upwards of $260 million into QuantumScape, with a recent funding round going towards a pilot production line for the cells.

QuantumScape has said that today’s EVs with 350 miles of range could achieve between 400 and 500 miles of range using its anode-free lithium metal batteries. However, that number could vary substantially depending on the pack size and the application.

Nissan

Nissan is not in good shape, with its profits tanking and sales falling off a cliff. But it’s not giving up in the race to develop next-generation battery cells. Like Toyota and Honda, Nissan is also working on solid-state batteries in-house. Executives from the company even told InsideEVs in April that they’re planning commercialization by the end of fiscal year 2028.

The automaker’s all-solid-state cells will use a sulphur-based electrolyte and maybe even a sulphur-manganese cathode, which could allow it to eliminate cobalt entirely. Cobalt—a byproduct of copper—requires dirty and expensive mining and is linked to labor violations in Congo.

BYD

Photo by: BYD

BYD said this year that it was working on solid-state batteries, but denied rumors of the popular Seal sedan benefitting from the tech. The automaker said that it expects to begin demonstrations starting in 2027, with mass production expected after 2030, but stopped short of sharing which EV exactly it will use for testing.

Hyundai-Kia

Hyundai is probably among the most cautious when it comes to solid-state batteries. While the automaker still appears to be working on the tech behind-the-scenes, senior Hyundai officials have said that they won't be able to commercialize the cells before 2030. The Japanese automakers by comparison seem to have more aggressive timelines for bringing these batteries to market.

It’s worth noting that today’s dominant chemistries such as nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) are steadily improving. Gains in performance, coupled with established supply chains and the falling cost of lithium, could delay the need for solid-state cells or make their business case harder to justify.

Still, we’re keeping a close eye on the battery market and will update this list as new developments arise.

As the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes record-high Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027, stakeholders are grappling with the dual challenges of small refinery exemptions (SREs) and the geopolitical dynamics of biofuel trade. For investors, this debate represents both a high-stakes policy gamble and a potential inflection point for domestic renewable energy infrastructure.

The RFS Reallocation Landscape: Policy Shifts and Market Signals

The EPA’s proposed RVOs for 2026 and 2027—24.02 billion gallons (bg) and 24.46 bg, respectively—mark a 9.5% increase from 2025 levels, with a clear tilt toward domestic production [1]. Notably, the agency has introduced a 50% devaluation of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported biofuels and foreign-sourced feedstocks, a move explicitly designed to bolster U.S. corn ethanol and biomass-based diesel (BBD) producers [2]. This policy shift aligns with the Renewable Fuels Association’s (RFA) advocacy for “prioritizing domestic renewable fuels over imports,” which it argues will stabilize markets and support rural economies [3].

However, the reallocation of SREs remains a contentious wildcard. As of August 2025, the EPA has granted exemptions to 175 small refineries across multiple compliance years, with 13 petitions still pending [4]. While the agency has committed to reallocating these volumes to maintain RVO integrity, industry groups like the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association warn that delays or inconsistent enforcement could create a “2-billion-gallon uncertainty” in the market [5]. This uncertainty is already manifesting in RIN price volatility: D4 (BBD) credits recently traded between $0.84 and $0.89 per RIN, while D6 (conventional ethanol) credits hovered near $0.80–$0.82 [6].

Investment Opportunities: Domestic Biofuels and Agricultural Synergies

The EPA’s policy recalibration is creating clear tailwinds for U.S. biofuel producers and agricultural stakeholders. The proposed RVOs are expected to drive demand for corn and soybeans, with Darling Ingredients noting that the devaluation of imported feedstocks could boost soybean oil demand by 1.5 billion gallons annually [7]. This has already spurred capital investment in soybean crush capacity, with five new plants operational in 2024 and more under construction [7].

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) further amplifies these opportunities. Section 45X tax credits for clean manufacturing have drawn $115 billion in U.S. clean energy investments since 2022, with biofuels and hydrogen production emerging as key beneficiaries [8]. For instance, biomass-based diesel producers stand to gain from the IRA’s 45V tax credit, which offers up to $1.29 per gallon for low-carbon fuels [9]. Similarly, the proposed 5.61 bg BBD mandate for 2026 could catalyze infrastructure upgrades at existing refineries, particularly in the Midwest [1].

Risks on the Horizon: SREs, Imports, and Market Fragmentation

Despite these opportunities, investors must navigate significant risks. The SRE backlog and reallocation process remain a source of regulatory ambiguity. Clean Fuels Alliance America has warned that delayed RVO finalization could disrupt compliance planning for 2026, while the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers argue that reallocating exempted volumes risks “increasing imports and undermining U.S. energy dominance” [10].

Geopolitical tensions also loom large. Brazil’s recent trade barriers against U.S. ethanol exports—coupled with the EPA’s import devaluation policy—threaten to fragment global markets and reduce price competitiveness for U.S. biofuels [3]. Meanwhile, the elimination of eRINs (electricity from biogas) under the “Set 2” rule has shifted focus back to liquid biofuels, potentially slowing innovation in emerging sectors like sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) [2].

Strategic Considerations for Investors

For investors, the RFS reallocation debate underscores the importance of hedging against policy volatility while capitalizing on structural trends. Key strategies include:

1. Diversifying Exposure: Balancing investments in conventional biofuels (e.g., corn ethanol) with advanced categories (e.g., BBD, cellulosic biofuels) to mitigate SRE-related risks.

2. Leveraging IRA Incentives: Targeting projects aligned with 45X and 45V tax credits, particularly in soybean oil processing and biomass-based diesel upscaling.

3. Monitoring RIN Markets: Closely tracking RIN price movements as a barometer of RVO enforcement and SRE reallocation progress.

Conclusion

The RFS reallocation debate is a microcosm of broader tensions in U.S. energy policy: the push-pull between domestic production and global trade, regulatory certainty and political expediency, and short-term compliance costs versus long-term decarbonization goals. For investors, the path forward lies in navigating these complexities with a dual focus on policy agility and market fundamentals. As the EPA moves toward finalizing its 2026–2027 RVOs by October 2025, the coming months will test whether the RFS can evolve into a stable, scalable framework—or remain a source of market fragmentation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 12:08:28.528845

Conclusion: Navigating the Storm Mexico's energy and trade sectors are at a crossroads.","The U.S.-Mexico relationship in 2025 is a volatile chessboard of tariffs, political brinkmanship, and energy sector recalibration. For investors, the stakes are high as U.S. policy shifts—ranging from Trump-era tariff hikes to judicially driven regulatory uncertainty in Mexico—reshape the calculus of nearshoring and energy investments. This article dissects the risks and opportunities in Mexico's energy and manufacturing sectors, offering a roadmap for navigating the turbulence.

The Tariff Tightrope: U.S. Policy as a Double-Edged Sword

The U.S. has weaponized trade policy to address non-economic issues, with tariffs on Mexican steel, aluminum, , respectively. These measures, framed as responses to fentanyl and immigration concerns, have created a ""shadow tax"" on Mexican exports. For context, . content threshold under USMCA. This creates a paradox: while U.S. manufacturers benefit from lower effective tariffs, foreign automakers (e.g., Kia, Nissan) struggle to compete, potentially diverting investment to U.S. or Asian hubs.

The Trump administration's 90-day tariff suspension in July 2025 offered a temporary reprieve, but the underlying instability persists. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's efforts to negotiate a new trade agreement are hampered by U.S. demands to curb Chinese transshipment and limit non-USMCA compliance. For investors, this means hedging against sudden policy pivots, particularly in sectors like steel and automotive manufacturing.

Energy Sector Paralysis: Policy Uncertainty vs. Decarbonization Needs

Mexico's energy sector is caught between its decarbonization goals and the U.S.-driven regulatory fog. The Sheinbaum administration's constitutional reforms, which redefined state-owned energy giants CFE and Pemex as ""state-preferred"" entities, have spooked private investors. These reforms, coupled with the elimination of independent regulatory agencies, have eroded confidence in Mexico's ability to enforce contracts or resolve disputes—a critical concern for capital-intensive energy projects.

Meanwhile, U.S. energy policies are compounding the challenge. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) has accelerated timelines for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, forcing developers to meet 2026-2027 deadlines for solar, wind, and battery projects. Mexico's energy infrastructure, , now faces a dual threat: U.S. tariff-driven supply chain disruptions and domestic policy unpredictability.

The irony is stark: Mexico's geographic and labor advantages make it an ideal nearshoring destination for clean energy manufacturing, yet U.S. tariffs on critical components (e.g., transformers, semiconductors) and Mexico's own regulatory overhauls are stifling growth. For instance, the 50% U.S. tariffs on Mexican copper—a key material for EVs and renewable projects—threaten to derail decarbonization synergies between the two nations.

Nearshoring Opportunities: A Fragile Window

Despite the headwinds, nearshoring remains a compelling opportunity for Mexico. The country's 12 free trade agreements, including USMCA, provide a framework for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). However, the Sheinbaum administration's judicial reforms—popularly elected judges and weakened oversight—have dampened investor appetite. In Q1 2025, , a stark decline from historical averages.

The automotive sector offers a glimmer of hope. , . While this challenges Mexican automakers, it also creates a niche for U.S. firms seeking to outsource production to Mexico's lower-cost, high-skilled labor force. Investors should monitor how U.S. .

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Hedge Against Political Risk: Prioritize investments in sectors less sensitive to U.S. tariffs, such as Mexico's renewable energy storage or hydrogen projects. These align with global decarbonization trends and are less exposed to trade policy swings.

Leverage USMCA Compliance: Target Mexican manufacturers that can meet the 40% U.S. content threshold, reducing effective tariff rates. This is particularly relevant for automotive and battery supply chains.

Diversify Trade Partnerships: Mexico's negotiations with the EU and Brazil to update trade agreements could offset U.S. volatility. Investors should consider portfolios that span multiple trade corridors.

Monitor 2026 USMCA Renegotiations: The Trump administration's push to renegotiate USMCA in 2026 could either stabilize or further destabilize the investment climate. Positioning for potential tariff reductions on steel and autos could yield long-term gains.

Conclusion: Navigating the Storm

Mexico's energy and trade sectors are at a crossroads. While the country's strategic location and labor advantages make it a nearshoring magnet, U.S. policy shifts and domestic reforms are creating a minefield of risks. For investors, the key lies in balancing short-term caution with long-term optimism—capitalizing on nearshoring opportunities while hedging against political and regulatory volatility. As the 2026 USMCA review looms, the next 12 months will be critical in determining whether Mexico can stabilize its investment climate or become a casualty of U.S. geopolitical maneuvering.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 11:01:40.761890

The electric vehicle (EV) market is experiencing turbulent times, especially in the aftermath of policy shifts following the previous U.S. presidential administration. Initiatives aimed at bolstering EV adoption, such as emissions regulations, tax credits, and funding for charging infrastructure, have faced significant rollbacks. These developments have contributed to a perception among certain sectors that the push for EVs is misguided, branding it as part of a “green new scam.” This sentiment has not only affected domestic manufacturers but has also created challenges for foreign automakers operating in the U.S. market.

A notable casualty of this shift is Volkswagen, which recently announced the furlough of 160 employees at its ID.4 factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, citing declining demand for the model. While a surge in EV sales is anticipated before a federal tax incentive deadline at the end of September, the longer-term outlook remains grim, raising concerns about consumer interest in electric vehicles in the future.

In a parallel development, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has reversed a previously established mandate that required automakers to meet specific EV sales targets. This decision comes amidst ongoing trade tensions and is intended to provide relief to domestic manufacturers grappling with the fallout from U.S. tariff policies. Initially, the Trudeau administration aimed for a goal of 20 percent electric vehicle sales by 2026, escalating to 100 percent by 2035. Industry experts criticized the plan as unrealistic, arguing it was not grounded in a thorough analysis of market conditions.

As manufacturers grapple with these shifting dynamics, a company named Horse Powertrain is putting forth a novel solution aimed at easing “range anxiety” among potential EV buyers. This joint venture between Renault and Geely has developed a compact engine and generator that can be retrofitted to existing battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Set to be showcased at the upcoming IAA auto show in Munich, Horse Powertrain’s C15 engine is marketed as small enough to fit within a briefcase, though its actual dimensions suggest it is slightly larger.

Horse Powertrain’s approach enables manufacturers to convert BEV platforms into range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) without extensive modifications. This innovation aims to capitalize on the increasing demand for REEVs in various global markets. The C15 engine is designed to comply with stringent emissions regulations and can run on a range of fuels, including gasoline, ethanol, and synthetic fuels. Importantly, it functions to maintain the battery’s charge rather than directly powering the vehicle, optimizing efficiency and minimizing fuel consumption.

Industry observers note that Horse Powertrain’s emergence at this juncture may reflect a broader reckoning within the automotive sector, as both governments and manufacturers reassess their commitments to purely electric vehicles. While many have long championed the all-electric future, the hesitation observed in consumer interest signals that more diverse powertrain solutions, such as hybrids, may become increasingly relevant.

As ongoing debates about the future of transportation technology continue, the need for affordability looms large. Currently, the higher price points of EVs compared to traditional vehicles remain a substantial barrier to widespread adoption. Until these concerns are addressed, the trajectory of the EV revolution may remain uncertain, with manufacturers needing to adapt swiftly to evolving consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EV-Market-Faces-Setbacks-as-Canada-Rescinds-Mandate-and-US.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 12:06:34.328148

Making homes and business more energy efficient has created an additional 18,000 jobs.

Solar and wind energy has benefited from various forms of government support. To the tune of $15 to $25 billion in 2024. Fossil fuels also receive various subsidies of $760 billion per year. Unlike solar and wind, those subsidies are not going away. In short, government subsidies for fossil fuels are over 33 times larger than subsidies received by alternative energy. These figures are from the Environmental and Energy Institute.

Yes, it takes energy to manufacture and build solar and wind energy, but they generate 20 to 30 times more energy than they use. At best, ethanol generates 1.64 times the energy it costs to make costs. In addition to the overwhelming scientific evidence of climate change, you have to wonder about hurricanes in North Carolina, forest fires in Canada, heat deaths in El Paso … I could go on.

We will always have fossil fuels. They are integral in the manufacture of steel, plastics, fertilizer and cement. Without fertilizer people starve, without plastics food preservation and medical procedures fail, no matter how many EV’s we have, we need roads to drive them on.

Real Clear Wire

The most disturbing thing about the nationwide rise in electricity prices is that the average consumer is footing the bill for the biggest power users – huge data centers for artificial intelligence.

Electricity prices could jump 15% to 40% in just the next 5 years, according to a recent forecast. And prices have already begun to jump. Retail electric prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022 – rising 13%.

Make no mistake, high electricity prices are now America's most pressing energy problem, affecting everybody, from the ordinary citizen to the huge corporation.

Ohio is part of the PJM Interconnection, a 13-state regional grid operator, the largest in the nation. Shortages in the supply of electricity – and even higher power prices – may affect PJM and the neighboring MISO grid in the Midwest sooner than other regions of the country. Both grids are staring down rapidly approaching capacity shortfalls.

Our electric power usage for AI data centers, electrification and industrialization is growing rapidly and supply is struggling to keep up. Some utilities in the Midwest have encountered demand levels they did not project for a decade. And we’re learning in real time the evolving mix of resources on the grid is proving ill-equipped for periods of peak demand.

During a recent heatwave, the MISO grid, which at times gets 25 GW of wind power – enough for 15 million homes – got just 1 GW of wind generation when power demand was its highest. Brutal heat and no wind left ten-of-billions of dollars in wind investments hulking statues. It was the coal and natural gas fleets that once again came to the rescue.

Our supply of power has almost no margin for error. And the situation is growing more challenging. While rising power prices are a signal to bring new generating capacity to the market, demand is growing faster than our ability to meet it.

New power plants and energy infrastructure – like pipelines and transmission lines -take years of planning and development before they can be connected to the grid. New data centers, on the other hand, with the power needs of entire cities or state are going from the drawing board to operational in a matter of months.

Ohio is already home to 172 data centers, the fourth largest total in the nation. But the next generation of data centers developed to serve the needs of AI dwarf these existing facilities. Consider the data centers tech giant Meta is building, including in Ohio. Just one of these data centers – scheduled to begin service next year – will have the power needs of the entire state of Nevada.

While policymakers are grappling with the challenge presented by the AI boom, and trying to regulate the impact these data centers will have on power markets, the onus must be on tech companies to step up.

Tech giants are placing orders for their own natural gas facilities and are even contracting to bring next generation nuclear power plants to the grid. While helpful, these are solutions for tomorrow while the impact on consumers is already biting today.

What tech companies have not done – at least so far – is embrace the existing coal fleet. It’s a glaring mistake.

Despite soaring electricity demand, many existing coal plants are scheduled to close early—a response to years of state and federal regulatory pressure. Losing these plants is simply incompatible with this moment.

Tech giants have the resources to ensure these facilities not only aren’t pushed off the grid but can be used far more efficiently to meet rising demand.

Addressing soaring electricity prices is going to take creative solutions. And the companies driving the surge must lead the way.

Consumers deserve reliable and affordable electricity, and the knowledge the corporations driving the surge in power prices are doing all they can to confront it.

President of the United States Donald Trump signed The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), a move that substantially alters the nation's energy investment and supply chain landscape, as detailed in a report by Rystad Energy. The legislation reverses key elements of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), shortening tax credit timelines for renewable energy while extending support for biofuels and fossil fuels.

The act accelerates the expiration of tax credits for wind, solar, and clean hydrogen projects. Solar and wind facilities must now begin construction within 12 months and be operational by the end of 2027, a significant contraction from the previous 2032 deadline. This compressed timeline is expected to trigger a rush among developers to secure project materials and qualify for incentives before the window closes.

New domestic content and foreign entity restrictions are central to the OBBBA's changes. To qualify for tax credits, projects must meet escalating sourcing thresholds for components, which top out at 90% for some equipment. Data from the IndexBox platform indicates these rules will necessitate a rapid and costly restructuring of clean energy manufacturing supply chains to prioritize domestic or ally-sourced materials.

The legislation introduces benefits for the oil and gas sector, particularly for companies operating on federal lands. A reduction in federal royalty rates and the reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures are projected to lower breakeven prices for new production by one to two dollars per barrel in most core US shale plays.

The OBBBA's provisions are projected to reshape global energy trade flows, creating advantages for North American biofuel feedstocks and disadvantaging foreign entities. The policy shift moves the US toward a strategy emphasizing domestic energy security and traditional fuels, altering the competitive environment for global clean technology investment.",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/Default.webp,N,,2025-09-07 11:01:47.567383

The key is on the Atlantic Ocean wind that will be captured by 176 wind turbines installed offshore, around 38 km from the Virginia Beach coast. Each of these turbines will be about 100 meters high and it will take advantage of the wind’s strength that constantly blows in the open sea, to generate free polluting emissions energy. So, let’s learn more about this interesting project that could benefit the environment.

Clean energy

The aim of this project is to produce 2,600 megawatts of electricity, which is 2,600,000 kilowatts. To have a clear picture of what this means, we could say that this amount of energy could keep lights, home appliances, and electric devices on thousands of families in the entire state of Virginia.

Apart from its environmental contribution, this project is going to have a huge impact on Virginia’s energy independence. I mean it will lower its dependence on power plants that work with coal, gas or petroleum. Less pollution for our planet, hurray!

Local economy

The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will also improve the economy of the region. During the construction, more than 1,000 jobs will be created and once the wind farm starts functioning, those jobs will continue being useful for operations and maintenance.

It is estimated that the economic impact will be hundreds of millions of dollars per year for Virginia. Also, it is expected the state will save about $3,000 millions in fuel costs for the first 10 years of the wind farm functioning.

Day and night energy

One of the positive things about offshore wind turbines is that they can generate electricity day and night, as long as there’s wind. In the open sea, the wind is more constant and stronger than in solid ground.

The project is also taking measures to protect marine life. During the process of the turbines installation, some special protocols have been implemented to minimize the impact on whales, dolphins, fish, and other species that live in nearby Virginia Beach.

Virginia’s energy future

This offshore wind farm wasn’t thought of as an isolated project, it is part of a wider strategy to transform Virginia into a clean energy leader in the U.S. The project shows evidence that the Atlantic Ocean can be a great source of renewable energy, and that investing in green technology is both beneficial for the planet and the local economy. So, everybody wins!

The CVOW joins other efforts of the country to diversify its sources of energy, reducing dependency on fossil fuels and strengthening energy safety. Now Virginia will have its own stable clean energy source.

What’s coming next?

The wind farm is expected to have the 176 turbines completely installed and functioning by 2026. However, the project has already started being built in 2023. Once this is finished, the energy will go through underwater cables toward the regional electric network (how crazy, right?). So, many homes and companies in Virginia will directly benefit from it. This project is a turning point in the way energy is produced in the state of Virginia, but also it will be a great example for other similar projects in the U.S. and around the world.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/virginia-offshore-wind-turbines-clean-energy.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 08:01:10.869675

This launch will transform everything we know about automotive sustainability, demonstrating that electric cars may not be the only solution for a cleaner future. Discover the German giant behind this project and what we can expect from this incredible synthetic fuel.

The secret project from a German company

The automotive industry has been increasingly seeking more sustainable solutions for its vehicles. The old ways of generating energy and producing fuel are no longer acceptable due to the alarming increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which are very harmful to the environment. With new regulations to reduce the carbon footprint within the automotive sector, companies are investing in more sustainable and clear fuel manufacturing technologies.

With this in mind, a renowned German company has decided to invest in a secret project, envisioning a cleaner future for the automotive sector. The company aims to become a pioneer with this unexpected and innovative new launch: the company is working on a hydrogen fuel cell and a super-tech car with 2,000-kilometer range, to accommodate this hydrogen fuel cell pill. The company behind this new and green project is Volkswagen, one of the leading players in the automotive market.

The model hasn’t been officially launched yet, but when it hits the market, it will be Volkswagen’s first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. This project is being manufactured in partnership with another German company, Kraftwerk Tubes, and the two are preparing to pioneer this new market that’s opening up in the automotive industry: the search for clean energy options beyond the more common electric cars.

Will Volkswagen abandon the manufacture of electric cars?

Despite Volkswagen’s decision to invest in this synthetic fuel project, the company assures that it will not be completely abandoning the development of electric vehicles. The model has seen a decline in production and growth — fell by about 15% and 40% in Europe —, not only at the German company but globally. This is related to several issues, such as the electric motor manufacturing process and the cost involved. These are precisely the reason that led Volkswagen to invest in other models.

Electric cars are known for commanding high market prices. Both their production and sales are quite expensive, and maintaining such a car ends up being costly and unaffordable for most people worldwide. With this in mind, Volkswagen is interested in connecting with this audience by offering its new hydrogen fuel cell car and another model, which will be electric but aims to be more affordable.

Volkswagen is already the leader in electric car sales in German — even surpassing the famous Tesla. Now, by adopting this new stance of maintaining more affordable prices for electric cars, the brand hopes to counter the prices of Chinese models, which are responsible for the decline in sales figures for European companies. With the cell of these two new projects, Volkswagen has everything it needs to leads the automotive industry into the future of the energy transition.

The future of the automotive industry has more than one option

As mentioned earlier, this Volkswagen project has not yet been officially launched; hydrogen fuel cell technologies is still in the conceptual stage. But there is undoubtedly a lot of anticipation.

This technology is expected to be more productive and affordable than current market trend, and hydrogen is considered the fuel of the future. After the company’s patent filling for this project, we hope to see other companies in the sector invest in this technology, moving towards an energy transition.

Forecasts suggest that by 2026, 10 million more people in Ethiopia will have access to electricity.
The Burden of Limited Electricity Access Ethiopia is one of the most populous countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 100 million people.
The country is experiencing rapid population growth, which has contributed to challenges such as food insecurity, environmental strain and low electricity access.
Looking Ahead Access to electricity in Ethiopia has risen to 55.4% and continues to grow rapidly.","The continent of Africa has one of the lowest electricity access rates in the world, making life more difficult for millions of people. Africa is home to 19% of the world’s population, yet many—mostly in sub-Saharan Africa—are living without electricity. Those who do have access often rely on power sources that are unreliable and unsustainable. Electricity demand has continued to grow over time, especially in Ethiopia, but the World Bank has been making moves to change that.

The ELEAP Program

The Ethiopia Electrification Program (ELEAP) is under the leadership of the World Bank Group. Its main goal is to reach complete electrification in Ethiopia by the end of 2025 and to support the rollout of new electrification systems. The plan is to expand electricity through solar mini-grids, with some grid (65%) and some off-grid (35%) energy systems.

So far, the results have been positive. As of 2025, the program has made strong progress. From March 1, 2018, to June 4, 2024, 6.3 million people gained access to on-grid electricity sources. Solar energy is the most viable option for renewable energy and the most reliable source, as it has already been a major part of Ethiopia’s electrical landscape. The implementation of solar energy fits easily with the systems already in place, which allows them to work together effectively. Because of these systems, more than 19,000 public facilities have gained access to electricity, including health clinics and schools. Forecasts suggest that by 2026, 10 million more people in Ethiopia will have access to electricity.

The Burden of Limited Electricity Access

Ethiopia is one of the most populous countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 100 million people. The country is experiencing rapid population growth, which has contributed to challenges such as food insecurity, environmental strain and low electricity access. Even though Ethiopia has substantial renewable energy resources, most of the population still relies on traditional biomass energy such as firewood and coal.

Even when households have access to power, financial constraints often prevent them from using it. Most electricity needs are for cooking, but the existing systems are not large-scale enough to provide the energy required for all Ethiopians to prepare their meals. As electricity reaches more areas, household chores have become easier since many families can now use electric stoves instead of fire-burning stoves, saving time and benefiting the environment. Solar-powered water pumps have also been introduced to provide clean water to rural communities.

Before the introduction of new energy systems, women and children had to go outside and search for wood to use as fuel and poor households had to devote all their income to energy. With expanded access, energy is now reaching both large infrastructure projects and poor urban communities.

Looking Ahead

Access to electricity in Ethiopia has risen to 55.4% and continues to grow rapidly. ELEAP has made significant progress in electrifying the country within just a few years. The outlook for Ethiopia and ELEAP remains positive, with sustainable energy sources supporting growth and improving the lives of many.

Now 20 years since Hurricane Katrina, we stand together as those who not just refuse to be silenced but who demand and reimagine anew.","“WE HAVE THE BODY BAGS READY.”

Though it was more than 25 years ago, I still feel the chill that ran through my body in a conference room in the wetlands of Northern California. I was a graduate student on a multi-university, interdisciplinary wetland restoration project team. We, a group of scientists from the south and west, had convened near one of our research sites, and a prominent plant biologist from Louisiana who spent her career researching the wetlands of New Orleans was presenting her work. It was four years prior to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, when we were naïve to the harsh reality that the government, at all levels, could and would devastatingly fail the most vulnerable Americans during an unprecedented natural disaster, leaving human tragedy in its wake.

Recall that in New Orleans, in the face of the catastrophic hurricane assigned the name Katrina, it was the levee system that did not hold, that burst sending water gushing back into the Lower Ninth Ward and other impoverished areas. Our project team was exploring what happens to wetland ecosystems when levee systems like the one that broke (i.e., an elevated humanmade barrier or embankment constructed to stop the natural flow of water often to create dry developable land) breach naturally over time. During her presentation, four years before Katrina, the plant biologist said she knew with certainty that if a massive storm hit, the levee systems in New Orleans would not hold. Four years prior to Katrina, she urgently shared this information with government officials, warning them of the imminent threat particularly to poor, elderly, and Black residents if the levee system broke. But instead of taking action to bolster the failing system, she was told: “We have the body bags ready.”

Warnings ignored before the storm

What have we learned in the 20 years since Hurricane Katrina? Twenty years after the dehumanization of the Superdome, the false and racialized narratives conflating looting with survival, the gutting helicopter footage of primarily poor and Black Americans seeking refuge on sinking rooftops, the government, at local, state, and federal levels collectively left the most vulnerable communities to drown and then fight for their lives on their own.

Surely, we’ve made advances since 2005 to increase disaster response. We certainly have. Yet it’s difficult to see that progress as the current federal administration systematically dismantles the upstanding science agencies designed to keep Americans safe. Innovations that include: advances in extreme weather modeling and forecasting, efficient warning systems, effective evacuation mechanisms, comprehensive disaster recovery plans and strategies. For example, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency foundational to our knowledge and understanding of extreme weather events has been decimated and the experts that created and perfected hurricane modeling and tracking have been fired. Likewise, it is the knowledge of experts at the National Weather Service (also part of NOAA) used to issue timely severe weather watches and warnings. Further, these lifesaving warnings and evacuation orders, that allow people time to plan and escape are being silenced.

Just this summer Congress unconscionably voted to cancel funding for the Center for Public Broadcasting which supports the very public radio that broadcasts critical extreme weather information to impacted areas, especially in rural regions that may not have access to other information sources. Finally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), designed to help Americans navigate unexpected disasters that leave their lives in disarray was merged with the Department of Homeland Security and lacks leadership and expertise. We saw the consequences of these unconscionable elimination decisions that allowed incompetence and dysfunction to lead the response in Texas during the floods that took too many lives; urgent calls unanswered, critical funding inaccessible, emergency warning systems failed. The slice of human tragedy we witnessed in Texas is a warning of what is to come on much larger scales as climate change increases the likelihood and severity of extreme weather events. We must act now.

Reimagine, resist, stand together

What can we do? How do we maintain hope and possibility as publicly available climate data and tools are erased from federal websites, limiting the ability to make evidence-based decisions? As agencies like the National Science Foundation terminate grants that engage in climate science research because they “no longer effectuate agency priorities;” an experience I know too well, having lost my NSF Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award that supports science teachers and students as community-based climate action researchers.

What we do is we reimagine, we resist, we collectively stand up. For inspiration, I look to sources of bravery and determination in and outside of science including: Data scientists saving and archiving tools that the government has tried to erase, scientists at the National Institutes of Health and on, issuing powerful statements of ethics and solidarity; persistent Americans, especially in red states, who attend town halls demanding that politicians answer to them, their constituents; residents of Los Angeles peacefully marching in solidarity with their immigrant neighbors and in defiance of a president who they will not allow to mischaracterize them; artists who reject the attempted erasure of their creativity because U.S. history and politics, in its truth telling, isn’t supposed to be comfortable.

As a professor I see the young people across this nation fighting to be heard, demanding the future they desire and envisioning it into being. We must stand up for science because science can be used to keep us all safe, especially the most vulnerable among us. Now 20 years since Hurricane Katrina, we stand together as those who not just refuse to be silenced but who demand and reimagine anew.

The pause of the 2026 EV mandate, announced by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is part of a broader strategy to alleviate financial strain on the auto sector caused by U.S. tariffs. These tariffs, including a 25% duty on non-U.S. vehicle imports and additional levies on steel and aluminum, have disrupted supply chains and forced automakers to reevaluate production strategies [1]. By removing the 2026 sales target, the government aims to provide automakers with greater flexibility to adjust to market realities. GM Canada’s president, Kristian Aquilina, praised the decision, arguing that EV adoption should align with consumer demand rather than government-imposed timelines [2].

The pause also coincides with the temporary resumption of the iZEV Program’s claims portal, allowing dealerships to submit unprocessed rebates for eligible vehicles. However, the program remains paused for new incentives, leaving consumers without financial support for EV purchases [3]. This gap in consumer incentives could slow adoption rates, particularly as EV prices rise due to tariffs and supply chain costs.

U.S. Tariffs and Supply Chain Reconfiguration

The U.S. trade war has amplified the challenges for North American automakers. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese EVs and non-U.S. auto parts have forced companies to localize production and rethink sourcing strategies. For example, Honda delayed its $15 billion EV production hub in Ontario, citing tariffs and slower market demand as key factors [4]. Similarly, General Motors has prioritized localized battery production to reduce costs and mitigate trade risks, aiming to cut battery cell costs by $30 per kilowatt hour in 2025 [5].

The Canadian government’s $5 billion aid package for firms affected by tariffs further underscores the urgency of reshoring efforts. However, this support does not extend to the steel and aluminum industries, which have been disproportionately impacted by U.S. levies [6]. This uneven relief highlights the fragility of Canada’s industrial strategy in a trade environment increasingly shaped by protectionism.

Long-Term Risks: Climate Goals and Market Uncertainty

While the 2026 pause offers short-term relief, it introduces long-term risks for Canada’s climate commitments. Environmental advocates warn that delaying EV targets could undermine efforts to increase supply and lower prices for consumers [7]. The 2030 and 2035 goals of achieving 60% and 100% ZEV sales, respectively, remain intact, but the absence of a 2026 benchmark may erode momentum. Provinces like British Columbia have maintained their EV mandates, creating a patchwork of regulations that complicate national coordination [8].

Financial analysts also caution that policy uncertainty could deter private investment in EV infrastructure. The Parliamentary Budget Officer’s analysis of production subsidies for Stellantis-LGES and Volkswagen highlights geographic and economic risks in scaling the EV supply chain [9]. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada’s assessment of weak productivity growth underscores broader challenges in reallocating capital to support electrification [10].

Strategic Adjustments and Investment Trends

North American automakers are adapting to these dynamics by shifting R&D and capital toward localized battery production and nearshoring. Ford and GM have announced significant investments in U.S. and Canadian plants to meet USMCA compliance and reduce reliance on foreign components [11]. However, the absence of federal rebates and the potential influx of cheaper Chinese EVs into Canada threaten to erode market share for domestic producers [12].

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) recent rollback of EV tax credits further complicates the investment outlook. This policy reversal could reduce consumer demand and slow the pace of electrification, particularly in cross-border markets where Canadian automakers compete with U.S. and Chinese rivals [13].

Conclusion: Balancing Competitiveness and Climate Objectives

Canada’s EV policy pivot reflects a pragmatic response to immediate economic pressures but risks undermining long-term climate and industrial goals. While the pause provides automakers with short-term flexibility, it also exposes the sector to heightened trade volatility and reduced consumer incentives. For North American automakers and suppliers, the path forward requires a delicate balance between aligning with regulatory shifts and maintaining commitments to decarbonization. As the 60-day review of the EV Availability Standard (EVAS) unfolds, stakeholders must advocate for policies that harmonize climate ambitions with market realities—ensuring that Canada remains a competitive player in the global EV transition.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 10:00:53.132519

Türkiye’s upcoming Renewable Energy Resource Zone (YEKA) tenders in November and December are expected to attract about $3.3 billion in investment, allocating 2,000 megawatts (MW) of wind and solar capacity across 12 provinces.

The projects aim to cut reliance on imported energy, expand domestic clean power use and strengthen the country’s renewable manufacturing base.

YEKA, a special tender model, is designed to allocate large-scale wind and solar projects, encourage local manufacturing, and attract foreign and domestic investment.

Six wind projects totaling 1,150 MW will be auctioned in Sivas, Balıkesir, Aydın, Denizli, and Kütahya, with project sizes ranging from 110 MW to 500 MW.

Nine solar projects, ranging from 40 MW to 260 MW, will be tendered in Elazığ, Kahramanmaraş, Erzurum, Bolu, Eskişehir, Mardin, and Van.

Alongside YEKA tenders, Türkiye is also advancing floating solar power projects. In Manisa's Demirkopru Dam reservoir, a 35-megawatt floating solar installation is planned.

To meet its 2035 energy targets, Türkiye recently passed a reform law to streamline permitting and approval processes, aiming to accelerate investments.

The government also plans to strengthen transmission infrastructure with 14,700 kilometers of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines totaling 40 gigawatts of capacity.

An additional 15,000 km of alternating current lines will be built, while interconnection capacity is set to reach 6750 MW for exports and 6600 MW for imports.

Alper Kalaycı, the head of Energy Industrialists and Businessmen Association (ENSIA), told state-run Anadolu Agency that wind projects from the tenders are expected to generate about $2.3 billion in investment, while solar projects will account for roughly $1 billion.

These large-scale YEKA projects will particularly benefit companies producing domestic components in the renewable energy sector, he added.

They will also help firms shape their future plans, he explained and added that demand is rising for wind equipment such as turbine blades, towers and generators, as well as for solar panels and other components.

""Localizing production not only boosts demand but also contributes to technological development,"" Kalayci concluded.

Hakan Erkan, secretary-general of the Turkish Solar Energy Industrialists and Industry Association (GENSED), said the 35-megawatt floating solar project planned at the Demirköprü Dam reservoir would attract about $20 million in investment.

Erkan added that floating solar plants help conserve water by reducing evaporation through their shading effect.

Co-published with Inside Climate News and The Texas Tribune

( ProPublica ) – Hakim Dermish moved to the small South Texas town of Catarina in 2002 in search of a rural lifestyle on a budget. The property where he lived with his wife didn’t have electricity or sewer lines at first, but that didn’t bother him.

“Even if we lived in a cardboard box, no one could kick us out,” Dermish said.

Back then, Catarina was a sleepy place. A decade later, oil and gas drilling picked up, and he welcomed the financial opportunities it brought. Dermish launched businesses to support the industry, offering everything from guards for drill sites to housing for oil field workers.

The growth also brought flares — flames burning off excess natural gas — that blazed day and night at wells in the surrounding countryside. Initially enamored of the industry’s potential, Dermish now worried that its pollution endangered the health of the town’s 75 residents. He began lodging complaints with the state in 2023, asking it to push companies to control emissions.

Inspectors with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality investigated, finding only a handful of violations, some of which the companies addressed. But that did little to allay the concerns of Dermish and his neighbors, who continued to see flares light up the sky and to smell gas wafting over the community.

“Starting first thing in the morning, talk about the stench. Then you call the state and nothing happens,” Dermish said. “They do absolutely nothing.”

His neighbor Lupe Campos, who worked in the oil fields for more than three decades, lives three blocks from a flare. Toxic hydrogen sulfide escapes from nearby wells, giving the air the smell of “burnt rotten eggs,” Campos said. “It’s hard to bear.”

While working to expand the nation’s oil and gas production, President Donald Trump’s administration has maintained that drilling in the U.S. is cleaner than in other countries due to tighter environmental oversight. To mark Earth Day, for example, the White House boasted in a statement that increased natural gas exports meant the U.S. would be “sharing cleaner energy with allies” and “reducing global emissions.”

But Texas, the heart of America’s oil and gas industry, tells a different story.

Texas regulators tout their efforts to curtail oil field emissions by requiring drillers to obtain permits to release or burn gas from their wells.

Yet a first-of-its-kind analysis of permit applications to the Railroad Commission of Texas, the state’s main oil and gas regulator, reveals a rubber-stamp system that allows drillers to emit vast amounts of natural gas into the atmosphere. Over 40 months — from May 2021 to September 2024 — oil companies applied for more than 12,000 flaring and venting permits, while the Railroad Commission rejected just 53 of them, a 99.6% approval rate, according to the data.

Natural gas is composed mostly of climate-warming methane but also contains other gases such as hydrogen sulfide, which is deadly at high concentrations. Gas escapes as wells are drilled and before infrastructure is in place to capture it. It also can be intentionally released if pressure in the system poses a safety risk or if capturing and transporting it to be sold is not profitable. Typically, drillers burn the gas they don’t capture, converting the methane to carbon dioxide, a less potent greenhouse gas, in a process called flaring. Sometimes, they release the gas without burning it, in a process called venting.

The permit applications showed oil companies requested to flare or vent more than 195 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year, enough to power more than 3 million homes and generate millions of dollars of tax revenue had the gas been captured. Those emissions would have a climate-warming impact roughly equivalent to 27 gas-fired power plants operating year-round, even if the flares burned every molecule of methane released from the wells.

“It’s a gargantuan amount of emissions,” said Jack McDonald, senior analyst of energy policy and science for the environmental group Oilfield Witness. “Because so much of this gas is methane and so much of it is either incompletely combusted or not combusted at all through the venting process, we see a huge climate impact.”

Oilfield Witness gathered and studied the Railroad Commission data on exemptions to the state’s flaring rules and shared it with ProPublica and Inside Climate News. The news organizations verified the data, including by soliciting input from professors at universities in Texas.

Railroad Commission spokesperson R.J. DeSilva said in a statement that Texas has made “significant progress” in addressing methane emissions. Companies must provide evidence that flaring is necessary, and, when approving permits, the agency follows all applicable rules, he said. “If an application lacks sufficient justification, it is returned with comments for clarification.”

“I am proud of the progress that has been made to reduce the waste of our natural resources,” Jim Wright, chair of the Railroad Commission, said in a statement, adding that “there is always room for further improvement.”

The analysis likely overstates emissions, since the near-guarantee that regulators will approve a permit gives companies an incentive to request authorization for amounts larger than they intend to emit to ensure they’re in compliance. For example, operators in four Texas counties flared about 70% of the volume of gas that their permits allowed, according to a recent effort to compare the state’s flaring data to information collected via satellite. And the Railroad Commission sometimes approves flaring smaller volumes than requested, which is not captured in the data.

“The Texas oil and natural gas industry is committed to ongoing progress in reducing flaring and methane emissions while continuing to meet the ever-growing demand for reliable oil and natural gas across the globe,” Todd Staples, president of the Texas Oil and Gas Association, a trade group, told ProPublica and Inside Climate News in a statement.

Residents of communities surrounded by flares and leaking wells, like Catarina, want the state and the industry to do more to control oil field emissions. The Railroad Commission approved eight flares within 5 miles of the town during the study period and 280 across surrounding Dimmit County, according to agency data.

The danger posed by the gas became impossible to ignore on March 27, as a 30-inch steel pipeline a half-mile from Catarina failed. The rupture blasted more than 23 million cubic feet of gas into the air, as much as is used in 365 homes in a year, according to data the company that owns the pipeline, Energy Transfer, reported to the Railroad Commission.

Dermish recorded the chaos with his cellphone. “The house is shaking,” he says in the video as the escaping gas roars, its concussions jostling the camera.

Fearing for their safety, he and his wife evacuated, heading to a neighboring town for the day. After they returned home that evening, he called the sheriff to ask what had happened. During the conversation, Dermish could feel the gas causing him to slur his words. The next morning, Dermish noticed new gas flares, presumably lit to release pressure in the pipeline network by burning excess gas. A cellphone video he recorded shows a towering column of flame, taller than a nearby telephone pole, billowing and rippling.

“Have you ever seen ‘Lord of the Rings’? Do you remember the Fire of Mordor?” Dermish said in an interview. “That’s what we have here.”

An incident report submitted to the state by Energy Transfer attributed the pipeline failure to a technician’s errors. Without objection from the Railroad Commission, the pipeline was repaired and back in service three days later. The agency did not assess Energy Transfer with a violation or a fine.

Energy Transfer did not respond to a request for comment.

After more than two decades in Catarina, Dermish and his wife are planning to move away. “It’s just too dangerous,” he said.

Is American Oil and Gas Cleaner?

While the Trump administration characterizes American oil and gas as cleaner than fossil fuels from other countries, it has rolled back rules regulating methane.

The Environmental Protection Agency has, under Trump, delayed implementing previously finalized rules that would’ve mandated that the industry monitor for methane leaks and address them. He and Republicans in Congress also repealed the country’s first-ever tax on methane. And in June, Trump revoked a Biden administration guidance document laying out how companies should comply with a law aimed at reducing methane leaks from pipelines.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

As the nation’s highest-producing oil and gas state, Texas is a key barometer of the U.S. regulatory environment and whether it has created a cleaner fossil fuel industry.

The Permian Basin — the country’s largest oil field, which straddles the Texas-New Mexico border — was estimated by a 2024 study to emit the second-most methane of any oil field in the world.

The industry disputes that finding, pointing to a June report from S&P Global Commodity Insights that found that the rate of methane emissions in the Permian Basin dropped 29% between 2023 and 2024. “Methane emissions management” is increasingly a part of the industry’s operations, Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at S&P, said in a statement announcing the findings. However, S&P’s report acknowledged that satellite data showed a much more modest reduction of 4%, contradicting the company’s own data, which was collected by airplane.

“We can say confidently that there is no evidence that methane emissions from the Permian Basin are low,” said Steven Hamburg, who studies methane as the Environmental Defense Fund’s chief scientist.

Texas’ Attempt to Rein In Flaring

In Texas, State Rule 32 prohibits flaring and venting gas at wells, except under a few specific conditions: while the well is being drilled, during the first 10 days after the well is completed and when necessary to ensure safety. Otherwise, drillers must seek an exception.

The Railroad Commission changed the application process for these exemptions in 2020 and issued new guidance in 2021. Operators would have to explain why they could not suspend drilling to avoid flaring and indicate that they had investigated all options for using the gas before flaring.

Oilfield Witness gathered all exemption requests since 2021, which showed the agency repeatedly approving permits that failed to comply with its guidelines. In many cases, oil companies asked to flare indefinitely or didn’t justify why they needed to flare, leaving blank the section of the application asking why the exemption was needed.

Capturing the gas requires an expensive system of pipelines, compressors and other infrastructure that can cost more than the gas is worth. In their permit applications, companies cite this reality, often listing financial considerations as the reason for seeking exemptions, Oilfield Witness found. These were nearly always approved, even though the agency wrote that finances were an insufficient explanation in a presentation on the permitting process.

“The Railroad Commission seems very interested in devolving decision-making processes to the companies themselves,” McDonald said.

The data also showed that nearly 90% of the approved permit applications were backdated, retroactively giving permission for flares that were already burning. Oil companies typically asked the Railroad Commission for permission to flare 10 days after they had already burned the gas.

A spokesperson said that when the commission revamped its guidelines in 2020, it allowed a longer period in which companies could file for a permit after they’d already started to flare. Even so, nearly 900 of the permits were applied for after the updated filing window and still accepted by the agency.

The Railroad Commission also approved more than 7,000 flares within areas where the gas reservoir being drilled was known to be high in hydrogen sulfide, increasing the likelihood that the toxic gas could escape into the air. Of those flares, 600 were within a mile of a residence, the agency’s data showed.

Minimizing flaring permits is “not a priority in any sense” for the Railroad Commission, said Gunnar Schade, an associate professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. “The priority is oil produced, and that means revenue for the state. Oil and gas is a priority, so who cares about the flaring?”

Overstating the Progress

The Railroad Commission and the state’s oil industry trumpet their work to reduce flaring. The agency points to state data showing flaring rates dropping dramatically, specifically since 2019. And the Texas Oil and Gas Association announced in early August that drillers in the Permian Basin “slashed methane emission intensity by more than half in just two years.”

But such claims are misleading, according to experts such as David DiCarlo, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s petroleum engineering school. Using 2019 as a starting point leaves a false impression that there’s been a sharp decline, he said, as methane emissions that year were staggeringly high due to booming production and inadequate pipeline capacity to gather the gas.

DeSilva, the Railroad Commission’s spokesperson, defended using 2019 as the baseline because “about five years ago we began taking proactive steps to reduce flaring in Texas.”

Taking a longer view shows that a median of 2.2% of gas at Texas oil wells was flared or vented over the past decade, according to a ProPublica and Inside Climate News review of state data. (Flaring at gas wells is rare because those sites have the necessary pipeline infrastructure in place to collect the gas.) That figure hovered just north of 2% in the most recently available data, representing a much smaller drop than the state and industry claim. The industry still hasn’t built sufficient pipeline networks to capture gas at oil wells, so, as production rises, so does flaring and venting.

“They can’t get it below 2% because they keep drilling,” DiCarlo said. Since emissions are highest when a well is being drilled, overall emissions will remain high as long as the industry is drilling new wells. “That’s just the nature of the beast.”

Among the largest beneficiaries of the state’s lax permitting system was an oil company called Endeavor Energy Resources. More than half the approved permanent flaring exemptions went to Endeavor, which merged with the $40 billion Diamondback Energy in September 2024. Endeavor also applied for the longest flaring permit — 6,300 days, or more than 17 years. The Railroad Commission approved the permit without shortening its duration.

Diamondback Energy did not respond to a request for comment.

The industry has simultaneously claimed that it is addressing methane while bristling at oversight.

Steven Pruett is the president and CEO of Elevation Resources, a Permian Basin oil company, and the immediate past chair of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, one of the industry’s main trade groups. His company saw a 2,408% increase in flaring immediately following new wells being drilled and a 692% increase in flaring overall in 2023, according to emails unearthed by environmental watchdog organization Fieldnotes and shared with ProPublica and Inside Climate News. In the email exchange with University of Texas faculty who were preparing a grant application for a federal methane-reduction program, Pruett blamed the increases on inadequate infrastructure to capture the gas.

Just weeks later, Pruett participated in a tour of the oil field alongside EPA staff, where he echoed the claim that the American oil and gas industry is cleaner than others and that drilling companies were complying with efforts to reduce emissions.

During his term at the helm of the national trade group, it spearheaded multiple lawsuits against the EPA over the government’s methane rules.

Pruett did not respond to a request for comment.

“A Constant Roar”

Those opposed to flaring face long odds in halting the practice, even in rare instances when the Railroad Commission hears objections.

Consider the experience of Tom Pohlman, then sheriff of Fisher County, who had a flare burning next to his home in the Texas Panhandle starting in October 2023. The driller responsible for it, Patton Exploration, solicited companies to extend a pipeline to the oil well to capture the gas and evaluated whether the gas could be used to mine bitcoin. But by July 2024, it still had no deal, so the company sought another permit to continue flaring up to 1 million cubic feet of gas per day for 18 months. “Patton is diligently pursuing every avenue possible to find a solution, but still needs more time,” the company wrote in its application.

When Pohlman learned that Patton Exploration had applied for a new permit, he and his neighbors urged the Railroad Commission to deny it.

“The sound that comes from the flame is a constant roar that we can hear throughout our property both day and night,” the neighbors wrote in their objection. “There is no peace and quiet since the day of its ignition.”

In September 2024, Pohlman became one of the few people to officially challenge a flaring permit in Texas, as he and Patton Exploration representatives went head-to-head in a hearing before a Railroad Commission administrative law judge.

“For approximately 20 of my residents in this area, it completely lights up their yard and everything else,” Pohlman said, telling the judge that the flare was 45 feet high. “I just need liveability for this neighborhood. We’ve had nothing but issues here.”

Patton Exploration’s lawyer, David Gross, acknowledged the neighbors’ frustrations but emphasized the importance of keeping the well pumping.

“You can’t produce the oil without producing the gas,” he told the judge. “It’s the public policy of Texas that the recoverable oil and gas in the state’s reservoirs be recovered because it is in the public interest.”

In January, the three elected members of the Railroad Commission voted unanimously to approve the permit and allow flaring for another 12 months.",https://media.juancole.com/images/2025/09/texasoil-copy.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 07:03:25.045578

With recent movements in technology and AI, Political Analyst Scott Mitchell talks through the potential impact it could have in Oklahoma, as the AI and energy consumption conversation grows day by day.

Watch the full conversation above or follow along for the biggest takeaways:

Rising Electricity Demand and Market Pressures

Data centers, AI, and big tech companies are major drivers of increased electricity demand, both in Oklahoma and across the U.S.

There's pressure on the grid and concerns that electricity price inflation will soon outpace the general consumer price index due to this rapid demand growth.

New energy generation projects—especially natural gas—face long lead times (up to four years), creating a ""capacity gap"" where demand may outstrip supply.

Oklahoma’s Energy Mix and Transition

The state has transitioned away from out-of-state coal toward local natural gas and renewables, which has reduced emissions, supported local tax bases, and helped keep electricity prices among the cheapest in the nation.

More than 60 renewable projects in Oklahoma have provided significant local economic benefits, especially to landowners and schools, and have enhanced the state’s ability to export electricity.

Oklahoma’s unique taxation and regulatory structure affects oil, gas, and renewable projects differently—renewables typically provide more direct local benefits while oil and gas provide gross production taxes to the state.

Politics and Policy Tensions

State legislative activities and proposals have led to uncertainty, with some described as “anti-business” or as favoring certain energy sectors over others.

There is a perceived lack of a “level playing field” between renewables and oil and gas in terms of regulatory burdens like setbacks and property rights.

National and state politics—including differences between federal administrations and Oklahoma’s own political factions—further complicate energy policy, sometimes leading to confusion and market disruptions.

Economic and Social Impacts

Keeping a broad mix of energy sources is considered essential for suppressing electricity prices and supporting Oklahoma’s economy; removing options could drive prices up, deter business investment, and negatively impact consumers.

Policy shifts that disadvantage renewables could mean lost opportunities, as energy markets are regional—neighboring states could step in to meet demand, taking economic benefits with them.

The discussion repeatedly highlights the strategic importance of energy affordability and supply in attracting and retaining businesses, and the ripple effect on local economies and jobs.

Energy Policy History and Lessons

Wind farms are derided as ugly, solar farms as land-grabbers tied to China, and nuclear energy as the patriotic option that showcases American technology and resilience.","Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has been reshaping the United States’ energy policy in ways that have alarmed advocates of renewable energy. His administration has rolled back incentives for wind and solar, halted projects already underway and sought to direct investment toward nuclear power and fossil fuels instead.

According to Reuters, officials close to the president have said the rationale is partly economic, partly aesthetic, and partly nationalistic, as nuclear power is seen as “more American” than wind and solar.

Nuclear as the “patriotic” option

According to Jarrod Agen, director of the US Energy Dominance Council, nuclear power fits more closely with the administration’s long-term vision than other clean energy sources. He argued that nuclear energy is more likely to be built with American parts and by American companies, which makes it a priority for federal financial backing, including loan guarantees and tax breaks, Reuters reported.

Agen described nuclear power as a “long-term play” that had not received the same investment focus as intermittent renewables like wind and solar. He added that the president viewed nuclear expansion as part of a three-pronged strategy to strengthen US energy and technological dominance. These are extending the life of existing coal plants, improving grid efficiency and investing in next-generation nuclear. In this framing, nuclear energy was not just a climate or energy issue but part of a broader competition with China, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence.

Renewables under siege

By contrast, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive stance against wind and solar. Since January, the White House has halted permitting for wind projects on federal land and waters, rescinded Biden-era plans for offshore leasing and revoked permits for projects that were already underway. As per a Bloomberg report, the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island — 80 per cent complete — was ordered to stop construction, ostensibly on national security grounds.

Trump’s Interior Department has also tightened approval processes for renewable projects, requiring personal sign-off from the Secretary of the Interior for all new wind and solar projects on federal land. This effectively subjects proposals to political scrutiny and delays, while simultaneously expanding opportunities for oil and gas drilling.

Why Trump dislikes wind and solar

The president has made no secret of his disdain for wind and solar power. He has long described wind turbines as ugly, inefficient and even dangerous. In July, after visiting his golf resort in Scotland, he reiterated that “windmills are a disgrace,” calling them bird-killing eyesores and “the most expensive form of energy there is”. Years earlier, he had unsuccessfully tried to block an offshore wind project near the same course.

Solar has fared little better in his rhetoric. Trump has mocked large solar farms as “big ugly patches of black plastic” that despoil farmland and rely heavily on Chinese imports. He has also portrayed renewable power more generally as unreliable, citing the fact that the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow. While developers have increasingly turned to batteries to address this intermittency, Trump has remained sceptical, Bloomberg reported.

Reversing the Biden legacy

Trump’s hostility to renewables represents a dramatic reversal of the policies put in place by his predecessor. Under Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was hailed as the most significant climate legislation in US history, providing long-term tax credits and subsidies that spurred a wave of investment in clean energy. But the Trump administration has worked quickly to undermine those measures.

The new tax-and-spending law, branded the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” phases out key credits for wind and solar earlier than planned. The Treasury Department has also issued guidance that makes it more difficult for projects to qualify for the remaining incentives. Beyond subsidies, the administration has launched trade probes that could result in new tariffs on wind turbine parts and polysilicon for solar panels, further raising costs for developers.

The cost debate

The administration has justified its actions partly by pointing to rising electricity costs. Officials have argued that adding renewable energy to the grid has driven up prices for households and businesses. Nationally, electricity costs rose at more than twice the rate of inflation over the past year, a trend the White House attributes to the expansion of intermittent power sources, Bloomberg said.

However, independent analyses suggest a different picture. Much of the increase has come not from renewables themselves but from the cost of upgrading the nation’s aging grid. Utilities have been spending heavily on transmission lines, poles and other infrastructure, both to accommodate new sources of energy and to harden systems against extreme weather. According to Bloomberg, analysts warn that slowing down renewables could actually make the supply crunch worse, as coal and gas plants retire and demand grows from industries such as data centres and artificial intelligence.

Economic fallout for the clean energy sector

The administration’s moves have already had significant economic effects. According to the advocacy group E2, $22 billion worth of clean energy projects were scrapped or downsized in the first half of 2025 alone, with job losses and investment shortfalls concentrated in states that had previously benefited from the IRA. Offshore wind, which was just beginning to take off in the US, has been especially hard-hit, as developers face both political uncertainty and financial losses from halted projects.

Smaller and mid-sized renewable developers are considered particularly vulnerable, lacking the resources to weather prolonged policy shifts. Larger firms have expressed cautious optimism that they can continue building projects grandfathered under existing credits, but even they face a tougher economic environment.

Renewables still competitive

Despite the administration’s rhetoric, independent cost assessments show that renewables remain competitive. BloombergNEF estimates that onshore wind and solar are cheap enough to compete directly with new natural gas plants, even without subsidies. Offshore wind remains more expensive but is still cheaper than new nuclear builds, which are slow to construct and face their own economic hurdles.

Blue states like California and New York continue to push forward with renewable energy, seeking to decarbonise their grids regardless of federal policy. Even in red states, renewables have proven popular. Texas, for instance, has led the country in wind generation and ranks second in solar, with most of its new grid capacity since 2020 coming from renewables or batteries. That momentum, however, could falter under Trump’s accelerated subsidy phaseouts.

Long-term outlook

The uncertainty created by Trump’s policies has raised alarms about the long-term outlook for US renewables. Developers and financiers may grow wary of committing to projects if they fear federal support can be withdrawn suddenly, even for projects already near completion. States counting on offshore wind to meet climate goals and rising demand could face setbacks, while the country as a whole risks losing ground in the global clean energy race.

At the same time, the administration’s favoured alternatives — nuclear and fossil fuels — face their own challenges. New nuclear capacity is years away from becoming operational, while gas and coal plants continue to retire due to age and market pressures. As per Bloomberg, analysts warn that slowing renewables could leave the US struggling to meet rising demand while falling behind in energy innovation.

A defining energy philosophy

Ultimately, Trump’s clean energy stance reflects more than economics. It embodies a broader worldview that prizes nationalism, aesthetics and traditional energy dominance over climate goals. Wind farms are derided as ugly, solar farms as land-grabbers tied to China, and nuclear energy as the patriotic option that showcases American technology and resilience.

The result is a sharp break from the trajectory set under Biden and a return to a vision of energy policy where fossil fuels remain central, and nuclear is elevated as the clean alternative worthy of federal support. Whether that approach can deliver affordable, reliable, and competitive energy for the future remains a subject of fierce debate.","https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/08/2-2025-08-44ce44a0c1ca3fd5c3dddb7024d89c69.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)",N,,2025-09-07 08:01:50.690149

The newly released Tesla Model Y L is capturing attention across China, with throngs of potential buyers flocking to showrooms eager to explore this latest addition to Tesla’s electric vehicle lineup. This model enhances the existing Model Y range by offering six seats, as opposed to the traditional five, and is priced at approximately $47,180. Notably, the Model Y L boasts an impressive extended range of up to 751 kilometers (around 467 miles) on a single charge, making it the highest-performing offering within the Model Y series.

Despite a slowdown in Tesla’s sales during the first half of 2025, the overall electric vehicle market is thriving, attributed to decreasing prices, an expanding charging infrastructure, and improvements in vehicle range. This shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) not only provides a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional gas-powered vehicles but also plays a crucial role in reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change.

Additionally, EV ownership presents long-term financial advantages. As gas prices continue to rise, drivers can benefit from lower operating costs and reduced maintenance requirements associated with EVs. A further cost-saving opportunity exists for those who install solar panels for home charging, allowing them to step away from dependency on the grid or public charging stations. EnergySage offers a streamlined process for comparing quotes from solar panel installers, potentially saving consumers up to $10,000 on installation costs. The combination of EVs and solar energy can significantly diminish individual carbon footprints.

Reports indicate that the Tesla Model Y L has been met with considerable enthusiasm in China, with sources indicating that around 35,000 orders were placed on its launch day. By introducing a higher-range, six-seat option, Tesla seems to be strategically enhancing demand and targeting a broader audience, particularly in a segment that was predominantly filled by the pricier Model X.

“Black churches have always been resilience hubs,” said Carroll, who added that they have often provided tangible support during times of crisis.","HAYWARD, Calif.—On a Sunday morning, the swirling timbre of a Hammond organ drifted into the lobby at Glad Tidings International Church of God in Christ. On the stage, a lively guest preacher, Ronzel Pretlow, roused the congregation in the Hayward, California, church, his raspy voice rising and falling as he sang and shouted, prompting his audience to stand. When the excitement waned, he shifted their attention to Glad Tidings’ founder, Bishop Jerry Macklin, seated in the pulpit.

“I think we owe our Bishop another round of applause for leading us into innovation and creativity,” the preacher said, eliciting a jingle from the organist. “I’m going back home to see if I’ve got room for some electric vehicle chargers,” he joked, knowing the profit that the chargers the church would soon have up and running could bring.

In September, Glad Tidings will complete its new Community Decarbonization Hub—a multipurpose campus featuring a 13,000-square-foot solar-powered building with battery storage and ten EV charging stations. The project, which started four years ago and has a $4.3 million price tag, won’t only cut the church’s energy usage and costs—it’s expected to generate around $500,000 annually. And in five to seven years, as more people charge their vehicles at the church, that amount is projected to double.

Glad Tidings isn’t the only Black church in the Bay Area undergoing this kind of transformation. It’s one of four, thanks to a partnership with Green the Church, an Oakland-based environmental justice nonprofit founded by Reverend Ambrose Carroll, and Gemini Energy Solutions, a cleantech company founded by Stanford University graduate Anthony Kinslow. The hubs Carroll and Kinslow are helping to build won’t only bring clean energy infrastructure to these churches, but also turn them into year-round resilience hubs, ready to support residents when a disaster hits—be it a power outage, wildfire or heatwave.

As climate change progresses and brings more frequent extreme weather events, resilience hubs are becoming increasingly necessary—especially in Black and low-income communities, where legacies of redlining and other forms of racial discrimination have left residents particularly vulnerable. These communities are often the last to receive access to affordable, energy-efficient technology. Still, they persevere through brutal temperatures, hurricanes and other weather disasters, frequently earning praise from political leaders and news media for their resilience.

“Resiliency isn’t enough,” Kinslow said. “Resiliency implies maintaining where you’re at, but I would think most of us would agree that the current baseline isn’t where we want it to be. Communities need to be generating their own money to implement their own decarbonization projects.”

Black churches don’t just need money for decarbonization, but for their basic survival. Across the country, their congregations are shrinking due to aging populations and a larger generational shift away from religion, according to a Gallup study. Unable to rely on tithes and offerings, church leaders are under pressure to find new ways to maintain their buildings—their largest economic assets—and cut costs. Clean energy offers them a way to keep thriving.

Inside the Decarbonization Hub

Bishop Macklin began building his ministry in the late 1970s, when South Hayward was troubled by “drugs, crime, and rampant poverty,” according to the church’s website. Called a “visionary” by many in his circle, about 30 years ago, Bishop Macklin established the Glad Tidings Community Development Corporation (CDC), a separate entity from the church, to help area residents access essential resources, such as food, healthcare and affordable housing. Between the church and the CDC, they’ve acquired enough buildings to cover half a city block.

At the church’s north campus, directly across from the main sanctuary, the new resilience hub features a 5,000-square-foot gymnasium, an exercise room, a STEM lab, a youth lounge, a kitchen and classrooms. Powered by solar energy, the building can accommodate over 500 people in an emergency, providing them with electricity, as well as air conditioning and filtered air. The church will add six EV charging stations to a sliver of parking lot between the resilience hub and the main sanctuary, which will also be equipped with solar panels this fall.

According to Benita McLarin, who leads the Glad Tidings CDC, her team has spent the past six months training a 15-person Community Response Team on fire safety, CPR and mental health first aid. “Bishop Macklin is well respected and people look to him always for answers,” said McLarin, a former military commander and public health official. “He shouldn’t be the only person in our organization who is ready to provide them.”

At the south campus, where the church operates its Spanish-language ministry, four of the fastest EV chargers on the market are already installed under eight solar-paneled carports. McLarin, who drives an EV herself, expects this location to be their greatest revenue generator, as it’s located closest to Highway 880, a major thoroughfare that runs from Oakland to San Jose. Currently, there are few charging options in this part of Hayward, a common issue in many lower-income and Black and brown neighborhoods. These are the same neighborhoods where gig drivers, who often struggle with low wages, tend to live. Access to EVs and charging stations could help them save money in the long term and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the process.

According to Kinslow, Glad Tidings will reinvest 80 percent of its profits back into the church and the larger South Hayward community. “We’re actually building more solar than the demand of the buildings, so we make a profit from that [by selling the excess electricity they generate through the public EV charging stations], and then we use that profit for programming,” Kinslow said.

For example, they may use the funding to provide free solar panels and batteries to income-qualifying households or help to finance electric vehicles for people in the neighborhood. “We see this clean energy hub as the starting point to decarbonizing the rest of the community,” he said. Kinslow’s company is also creating a “Neighborhood Decarbonization Index” that utilizes survey data and machine learning to assess greenhouse gas emissions and evaluate neighborhood decarbonization progress over time.

Partners in Energy and Faith

Kinslow completed his Ph.D. at Stanford and spent most of his student years thinking about how to bring renewable energy to communities of color. Inspired by Al Gore’s documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” in high school, he wanted to make a difference. He launched Gemini Energy Solutions while he was still in graduate school, with the goal of democratizing clean energy. In 2020, he met Bishop Macklin at an event organized by Carroll’s nonprofit, Green the Church (GTC), and was later introduced to McLarin. A year later, they began crafting a plan to bring the community decarbonization hub to fruition.

Gemini Energy Solutions handles project management and community engagement, while Green the Church rallies clergy and collaborates with their internal “green team.” Rev. Carroll founded GTC fifteen years ago and has built relationships with faith leaders across the country. The organization currently has contracts with more than 15 churches, representing various denominations, to develop Community Decarbonization Hubs. In addition to Glad Tidings, GTC and Gemini are working to build these hubs at three other Bay Area churches: Twenty-Third Avenue Church in Oakland, The Way Christian Center in Berkeley and University AME Zion in Palo Alto. Glad Tidings is the furthest along, and the lessons learned there are shaping the work Kinslow and Carroll are doing at the other churches.

According to Kinslow, Pacific Gas & Electric Company’s (PG&E) delays in connecting the solar panels, battery, master meter and EV chargers to the power grid set the project back by about six months. Now, their construction partner, Imperial Electric Service in Fresno, has a designated interconnection representative at PG&E to accelerate future projects.

Gemini’s project team also realized they needed a contractor to explain the impacts of construction, like loss of parking, “which is a big thing for churches,” Kinslow said.

But perhaps the biggest challenge was the two years it took to find financing.

“We started this project based on faith,” said Carroll, noting this was before the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which invested billions in clean energy. But banks struggled to grasp the concept of a Black community generating income rather than an outside company profiting from it, Carroll said. Eventually, he and Kinslow formed a joint entity, Green the Church Renewable Energy Development (GTC R.E.D.), which secured a $3 million revolving loan from the Kresge Foundation to bring clean energy to churches across the country.

More support came from Green Power Ventures, a Black-led investment management firm focused on climate resilience in low- to moderate-income areas, and Freedmen Green Bank & Trust, a Black-led nonprofit and charitable trust devoted to climate resilience and clean energy. And while the churches aren’t putting money into the community decarbonization hubs, Kinslow said, they are investing a lot of “sweat equity.”

Building on Bay Area Legacies

The Bay Area’s Black churches have long been a force for social change. In East Palo Alto, congregants organized community watch programs during times of racial unrest. St. Augustine’s Episcopal Church in Oakland is the birthplace of the Black Panthers’ first free breakfast program, which served undernourished children before school. At the 107-year-old University AME Zion (UAMEZ) church in Palo Alto, they see their forthcoming community decarbonization hub as a continuation of this legacy—and their own commitment to justice.

“When we started talking [about the hub] as a community, it wasn’t like, ‘Why should we do this?’” said UAMEZ Pastor Kaloma Smith. ”It was like, ‘This makes sense for the betterment of our world.’”

Born in Jamaica and raised in New York, Smith arrived at UAMEZ in 2013 to find common challenges facing Black churches, including declining membership. That drop-off is partly from residents leaving Palo Alto—and the state of California—due to rising costs of living, Smith said. The community decarbonization hub is part of his long-term effort to “revitalize” the church and “be more effective, particularly for Gen Z and young families,” for whom he says environmental issues are a top concern.

Working with Kinslow on the hub marks a full-circle moment: he joined the UAMEZ congregation while still a student at Stanford, and approached Pastor Smith with a proposal to replace the sanctuary’s fluorescent lights. “We didn’t really have the money at the time,” said Smith. “But we saw there was phenomenal intersectionality between creating a benefit for the church, the environment and the community.”

Besides installing solar panels and making energy-efficient upgrades, UAMEZ will add 12 to 16 EV charging stations, including eight fast chargers, to its parking lot. Construction of the UAMEZ hub is expected to take only six months, including its connection to the power grid. In the event of an earthquake, Smith envisions UAMEZ as the go-to place for “all the things” residents of midtown Palo Alto might require.

“Black churches have always been resilience hubs,” said Carroll, who added that they have often provided tangible support during times of crisis. But they have the potential to do more, he said, by turning their parking lots into “revenue-generating microgrids” that meet their neighborhoods’ rapidly changing energy and climate needs.

Back in the pulpit at Glad Tidings, pink and purple lights illuminate the stage, casting a glow on Pretlow, the guest preacher, and an attentive congregation. “Prosperity is coming to your house,” he proclaimed, as the bassist plucked his strings. “Favor is getting ready to find your address!” His words seemed fitting for the era Glad Tidings is entering—as if that blessing had already come to pass.

This marks the first project under President Trump’s Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program.

This development represents an advance in providing modular nuclear energy for manufacturing operations, promising a reliable and sustainable energy source.

The Aalo-X represents a new breed of extra modular reactors (XMR), being positioned strategically next to INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

The target is for the reactor to reach criticality, enabling a self-sustaining nuclear reaction by 4 July 2026.

Aalo Atomics secured this opportunity through the competitive process managed by the US Department of Energy (DOE) as part of their pilot programme.

Government and national laboratory support

The DOE launched the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program in June 2025 after Executive Order 14301, reforming testing protocols to authorise advanced nuclear designs at non-traditional sites, thereby fostering innovation for applications such as the growing demands of the manufacturing sector.

Matt Loszak, Co-founder and CEO of Aalo Atomics, says the selection is a clear signal of public-private alignment: “Our selection for the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program is a significant catalyst for achieving our goal of going from ‘founding to fission’ in less than three years – a feat many deemed impossible just a year ago.

“This milestone groundbreaking event is a testament to the potential that can be unlocked when public entities and private companies partner together in the critical interest of the nation.

""This is a pivotal time for the US nuclear energy industry and we are incredibly proud to be at the forefront.”

Designed as a testing site, INL supports technologies aimed at enhancing energy scalability, reliability and deployment speed—crucial for manufacturing facilities that seek consistent, low-impact energy solutions.

“Today’s ground-breaking symbolises the progress that can be achieved when innovation, vision and national purpose come together,” adds John Wagner, Laboratory Director at INL.

“At Idaho National Laboratory, we are proud to support the Department of Energy’s efforts to accelerate advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen America’s energy security, provide reliable power and inspire the next generation of innovators.

“Projects like Aalo-X reflect the promise of nuclear energy to meet our nation’s historic demand growth and help enable a more prosperous future for our nation.”

Meeting manufacturing energy needs

The Aalo-X reactor serves as a prototype for Aalo’s commercial solution: the Aalo Pod, which is tailored to supply power to manufacturing centres.

“If China were to set a course for a 1.5C world, it would need to cut emissions by 30% by 2035.","China’s vital statistics

Chinese power took on an old-fashioned hue in the past week with a huge military parade, a gathering of former allies Russia and North Korea, and President Xi Jinping’s defiant vow not to be intimidated by bullies.

That display reminded many of the cold war, but it captured only a fraction of China’s far greater modern influence, primarily built on a formidable economy, dramatic advancements in renewable energy, and a willingness to engage globally with the greatest crisis facing humanity: climate breakdown.

In that sense, the tanks, cannon and missiles that filed past Tiananmen Square may well prove less important in reshaping the world order than the wind turbines, solar panels and electric cars that are churning out of Chinese factories on to fields and roads all over the planet. They are the reason China has already won the battle for the energy of the 21st century.

If history is any guide, the country that dominates energy usually dominates economics and politics, which is why it is not just old war allies that are cosying up to Beijing. Narendra Modi, the president of longtime rival India, also visited China last week for the biggest ever meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation along with dozens of other regional leaders. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, led a delegation to Beijing this summer to coordinate climate policy. The Brazilian executive secretary of Cop30 will visit next week with a similar mission, knowing the success or failure of the annual climate summit now depends on China more than any other nation.

Expectations for Chinese climate leadership are rising in tandem with dismay at the US, which will attend Cop30 as an observer and disrupter that, under Donald Trump, appears to be trying to lurch backwards towards a 20th century comfort zone of oil, gas and coal.

The contrast could become even more striking once China confirms it has reached a positive tipping point after which it will irreversibly shift away from fossil fuels. Last year, the world’s biggest carbon emitter registered a very slight decline in greenhouse gas output. Many analysts believe this means the country’s carbon use will peak this year or very soon. If that is confirmed, it would be a moment of considerably greater significance than Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from UN climate negotiations.

The timing will be clearer when China unveils its revised nationally determined contribution (NDC), the climate actions plans countries promised to provide under the Paris agreement. This announcement, expected before next month’s UN general assembly, will be one of this year’s most eagerly watched declarations because no other country has been able to match China’s power to make or break the Paris targets to hold global heating between 1.5C and 2C.

But how real are the hopes China will step up and show greater leadership on finance and emission cuts, as well as renewable manufacturing?

There have been false dawns in the past. Coal – the most polluting of fossil fuels – drove China’s supercharged economic growth for most of the past three decades, though production declined for a few years in the wake of the global financial crisis and plateaued briefly during the Covid lockdown. Whether predictions of peak carbon prove more substantial this time will depend on the Beijing leadership’s next five-year plan, a domestic policy document for 2026-2030 being drawn up by the leadership in Beijing.

Speculation about the priorities continues to swirl. On one side is caution and a sense of justice that China should not try to step into the void left by the US because that would allow the latter to escape its responsibility as the world’s biggest historic emitter. On the other is geopolitical ambition and the momentum of an economy increasingly reliant on renewable energy investment for growth.

While China’s overall GDP expansion is slowing, the speed of cleantech investment remains breathtakingly fast. Last year, the amount of wind and solar under construction was double the rest of the world combined, helping China to reach an installed capacity of 1,200GW six years ahead of the government’s schedule.

The country is similarly ascendant in supplying overseas markets with renewable technology. Last year for the first time, the top four wind turbine makers in the world were all Chinese. It is a similar story of majority market share for the manufacture and export of photovoltaic cells and electric vehicles.

When it comes to clean energy, it no longer makes sense to talk about competition, says Li Shuo, the director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society. “There is only one player. The US is not even in the room. I have full confidence that dynamic will continue.”

In the run-up to Belém, the contrast with the US looks ever more stark and is likely to shape geopolitics for decades to come. Under Trump, the US has shut down climate research centres, promised to drill for more gas and declared this to be “the moment” for coal. Meanwhile, $22bn in clean energy projects have been cancelled and wind power investment has shrunk to its lowest level in a decade.

China may not be in favour of multiparty democracy at home, but on the global stage its officials have made clear it will be a champion of multilateral decision making.

Xi has not tried to fill the void left by Trump, but he has presented himself – and China – as a reliable and constructive partner, particularly on the climate issue: “However the world may change, China will not slow down its climate actions, will not reduce its support for international cooperation, and will not cease its efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind,” he said this year.

Before previous Cops, senior US and Chinese negotiations often held a bilateral meeting to ensure the world’s two biggest emitters were on the same page. This year, China held separate climate talks with the EU and affirmed they would work together to achieve a successful Cop30 with “ambitious and equitable” outcomes. Von der Leyen called the joint declaration a big step forward. “Together, the European Union and China must uphold the Paris agreement. Now more than ever,” she said.

The text did not mention the main areas of friction between the signatories: China’s fast-growing share of sales of electric cars, batteries and solar panels, its stranglehold on critical minerals needed for wind turbine magnets, and its continued heavy investment in coal.

Scientists and campaigners say the climate will not be stabilised solely by selling more photovoltaic cells or windmill blades; it is also necessary to phase out fossil fuels. On this half of the balance sheet, China’s record remains “highly insufficient” and its current policies would, if continued, push the planet towards 4C of heating, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent initiative assessing countries’ compliance with the Paris agreement. It points out that China is off course from the commitments it previously made to “strictly limit” coal use and to reduce energy and carbon intensity by 2025.

Lauri Myllyvirta of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said Xi had compromised. “He does favour cleaning up the energy system and moving to a cleaner economy more broadly – this is a consistent and longstanding feature in his speeches – but clearly it’s not an overriding priority for him when there is pushback.”

The pushback has been most evident in the coal sector, where there has been a surge of investment in the past two years to the highest level in a decade. Major domestic coal companies, such as CHN Energy, Jinneng and Shaanxi Coal and Chemical, have considerable political influence. Although they don’t actively campaign against climate science like Exxon in the US, China analyst Qi Qin said they often pushed the energy security narrative by positioning coal as essential for reliability and independence, adding: “A lot of it comes down to concerns about energy security. During 2021–2022, droughts hit hydropower hard, and the system didn’t have the flexibility to handle that well. That led to some power shortages, and since then, there’s been more focus, especially from local governments, on securing local power supply, which partly explains the new wave of coal project approvals and construction.”

Even so, renewables has moved faster. The share of fossil fuels in China’s installed generation capacity has now fallen below half, down from two-thirds a decade ago. Whether this trend continues will depend on a recent change in energy pricing and the level of ambition in the NDC and five-year plan.

If the government wanted to send a strong signal, it could commit to no new coal power, sectorial targets for electric vehicles, electric steelmaking and building efficiency, and – most importantly – a sizeable cut in overall emissions over a clearly defined period.

Li dampened expectations the headline figure would fully align with the Paris targets. “If China were to set a course for a 1.5C world, it would need to cut emissions by 30% by 2035. A 2C world would mean reductions of 20% by the same year. Neither is likely. He said: “We understand the Chinese side is most likely to provide 8-15%. There will be a gap. If that landing zone is where they end up, then there could be the usual story of ‘under promise, over deliver.’”

He expects specific sectoral targets on how much renewable capacity China will install over the coming decade. “They will be very very big numbers,” Li predicts.

The economy may drive ambition more than politics. Belinda Schäpe, a policy analyst at CREA, said existing trends suggested it was still possible for China to reduce emissions by 30% over the coming decade, which would bring huge economic benefits, especially if combined with a continued global energy transition. “This would also strengthen China’s clean energy industries, which could double in value by 2035, adding CNY 15tn ($2.1tn) to the economy.”

At Belém, China will also seek to boost sales of renewables and possibly announce deals to build and finance a solar panel manufacturing plant in Brazil, in addition to the BYD electric car factory that is already there. This may have the feel of a trade fair, but the conference organisers said this was in line with the primary goal of Cop30, which is to accelerate action on global heating.

Brazilian diplomats also expect their Brics partner to invest in the Tropical Forests Forever Fund, which is the flagship initiative of the summit host. Chinese government sources told the Guardian this proposal was viewed positively in Beijing. Support for this effort to protect standing forests would be a sign of how China is steadily increasing climate finance outside the UN framework as it grows in wealth and responsibility. European diplomats express hope that China will lean in much further during Cop30.

Conservation NGOs hope Beijing will do more to crack down on imports of wood products from areas of illegal deforestation. China’s revised forest law theoretically prohibits these items, but it does not demand transparency or due diligence from traders so little has changed. China remains the biggest importer of illegally felled timber.

At previous Cop meetings, China has often cut an understated figure relative to its size. But its role is often decisive. At Cop26, it aligned with India to water down the language to fossil fuel “phase down” rather than “phase out” and at the 2009 Cop in Copenhagen, it was criticised for sabotaging the conference. More positively, it was widely credited for helping to get the Paris agreement over the line and last year played a crucial role together with the EU to set a climate finance target, the new quantified collective goal, that most countries could sign up to.

China sees itself as a leader of the developing world, but as it has grown richer from renewable technology and is increasingly to blame for the climate crisis (it is now the second biggest emitter), it is under more pressure to cut emissions and pay more to help others do the same. Brazilian diplomats expect their Brics partner to be a quiet but strong supporter of their agenda.

How far it goes is still to be seen, but the direction of travel is at least clear – and it is the opposite of the US.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15ae8a33c3fce2a09a434aa480021c97716990d/625_0_3750_3000/master/3750.png?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=51c4fc10b69e1f9009b29e2ccfa6ede0",N,,2025-09-07 05:00:24.905251

Robotic arms swing methodically, while digital screens display real-time production data.

The park has established a complete industrial chain covering research and design, manufacturing and quality testing, according to He Changguo, manager of the firm's northern regional manufacturing center. Since 2008, wind turbines produced in the park have been deployed in more than 100 projects across China.

This facility epitomizes the accelerating pace of Inner Mongolia's green transition. Rich in coal and central to China's energy supply, the region accounted for more than one-quarter of the nation's coal output in 2024. This wealth of resources fueled decades of growth but also tied the region to high-polluting and resource-heavy industries.

In recent years, however, the nationwide low-carbon push has set the region on a new course. By tapping its abundant wind and solar resources, the region is cultivating fresh momentum for growth. Once renowned for its coal reserves and desert environment, Inner Mongolia is now dotted with vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines.

So far, over 30 companies similar to Ming Yang Smart Energy Group, which operate full industrial chains in the new energy sector, have taken root in the region. In 2024, the added value of large-scale new energy and related industries rose by 20.1 percent compared with 2023, and that of new energy equipment manufacturers surged 42.4 percent year on year.

Gong Mingzhu, director of the regional Development and Reform Commission, said Inner Mongolia has established a comprehensive industrial chain for wind, solar, hydrogen and energy storage equipment manufacturing, effectively positioning the region to embark on a new chapter in industrial development.

As new energy industries gain momentum, Inner Mongolia is also transforming its traditional coal-based sectors, shifting from simple extraction toward a more diversified and cleaner industrial system.

A plant in Ordos exemplifies this transformation. Built by Inner Mongolia Baofeng Coal-based New Material Co., Ltd., the facility synthesizes olefins -- a class of chemical compounds serving as key raw materials for industrial products from plastics to textiles and aerospace components -- from coal.

With an annual production capacity of 3 million tonnes, this facility stands as the world's largest single-site coal-to-olefins project, according to the company.

Notably, the plant employs green hydrogen at scale to replace fossil fuels in olefin production, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 6.3 million tonnes annually.

In 2024, Inner Mongolia's modern coal chemical industry output exceeded 100 billion yuan (about 14.07 billion U.S. dollars), while the region ranked first nationwide in both coal-to-gas and coal-to-olefin production capacities.

""Simply mining and selling coal cannot fully realize the value of Inner Mongolia's energy endowment, nor can it meet the requirements of building a modern country,"" said Hu Chengdong, deputy director of the regional energy bureau.

It is imperative for Inner Mongolia to transition from an extractive growth model, shift from factor-driven to innovation-driven development, and propel traditional industries toward higher efficiency and greater value, Hu added. ■",,N,,2025-09-07 07:02:38.516841

However, execution risks remain: - Production Delays: The temporary shutdown of the Normal plant in September 2025 to retool for R2 production could disrupt delivery targets.","The electric vehicle (EV) market has entered a new phase of brutal competition, where margin preservation and capital efficiency are no longer optional—they are existential imperatives. Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation, leveraging supplier renegotiations, production scaling, and design simplification to outpace rivals like Tesla (TSLA) and BYD (BYDDY). For investors, the question is no longer whether Rivian can survive this environment but whether its strategic pivot to lean production and commercial vehicle focus can unlock long-term value in a sector increasingly defined by razor-thin margins.

Capital Efficiency: The R2 Revolution

Rivian's transition from the R1 to the R2 model represents a masterclass in capital efficiency. The R2, a midsize SUV priced at $45,000, is designed to be 40% cheaper to produce per unit than the R1 lineup. This cost reduction stems from two pillars: supplier renegotiations and design simplification.

Supplier Contracts and Bill of Materials (BOM) Optimization:

Rivian has secured 50% lower component costs for the R2 compared to the R1, with a BOM of $32,000 per unit. This was achieved through aggressive supplier renegotiations and a shift to U.S.-based sourcing, which avoids 25% import tariffs. By locking in these costs, Rivian insulates itself from the volatility that has plagued competitors like BYD, whose Q2 2025 gross margin fell to 16.3% due to price wars in China.

Conversion Cost Reduction:

The R2's simplified architecture—streamlined body design, fewer wiring harnesses, and modular closures—reduces assembly complexity. Rivian projects conversion costs for the R2 to be less than half of those for the R1, a critical advantage in an industry where fixed costs dominate. This contrasts sharply with Tesla's recent struggles, where Q2 2025 automotive gross margins fell to 18% despite energy storage profits.

Supply Chain Optimization: Scaling Without Sacrificing Profitability

Rivian's ability to scale production while maintaining cost discipline is underpinned by its dual-facility strategy. The Normal, Illinois plant, now expanded to 1.1 million square feet, will produce 215,000 R2 units annually by 2026. This is complemented by the Georgia facility, a $5 billion project set to begin production in 2028 with 400,000-unit capacity. Crucially, Rivian has secured a $6.6 billion Department of Energy loan and a $1 billion Volkswagen investment to fund these expansions, ensuring capital efficiency without diluting equity.

The Georgia plant's phased approach—200,000 units per phase—allows Rivian to align production with demand, avoiding the overcapacity pitfalls that have plagued Tesla's Gigafactories. Meanwhile, the R2's U.S.-based production and eligibility for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit further enhance gross margins, a stark contrast to BYD's reliance on price cuts to maintain volume.

Margin Projections: A Path to Outperformance

Rivian's Q2 2025 results—$206 million gross profit loss—highlight its current challenges. However, the company's trajectory is clear: it anticipates gross margins above 20% by 2026, driven by R2's cost structure and economies of scale. This would outperform Tesla's 18% and BYD's 16.3%, positioning Rivian as a margin leader in a sector where profitability is increasingly elusive.

The key differentiator lies in Rivian's commercial vehicle focus. While Tesla and BYD compete in the consumer segment, Rivian's Electric Delivery Van (EDV) and R2's commercial potential offer higher-margin opportunities. Amazon's 100,000 EDV order and Rivian's partnerships with logistics firms provide a stable revenue stream, reducing reliance on volatile consumer demand.

Implications for Investors: Risks and Rewards

For EV investors, Rivian's strategy presents a compelling but high-risk proposition. The company's focus on lean production and commercial vehicles aligns with long-term trends in logistics electrification and U.S. manufacturing. However, execution risks remain:

- Production Delays: The temporary shutdown of the Normal plant in September 2025 to retool for R2 production could disrupt delivery targets.

- Tariff and Regulatory Shifts: The expiration of the EV tax credit in September 2025 and potential changes in trade policy could erode margins.

- Competition: Tesla's vertical integration and BYD's cost leadership pose ongoing threats, particularly in the mass-market segment.

That said, Rivian's capital-efficient model and strategic partnerships with Volkswagen and the Department of Energy provide a buffer against these risks. For investors with a medium-term horizon, Rivian's ability to achieve EBITDA breakeven by 2027 and its projected margin outperformance make it a high-conviction play in the EV sector.

Buyers are making quick decisions to take advantage of the expiring incentive.

Washington had a record year for electric vehicle sales in 2023, with registrations increasing by 43%. Nearly 224,000 electric vehicles are now on the state’s roads.

Steven Hershkowitz from the Washington Department of Commerce noted Washington’s leadership in electric vehicle sales.

“Nationally, we haven’t seen a huge spike in sales, a little bit of an increase, and we expect that increase to go up quite a bit in September before the tax credit expires,” he said.

Incentives have played a significant role in driving this growth. Last year, a state rebate program offered up to $9,000, but demand was so high that it sold out in just three months.

“Commerce ran a program called the EV Instant Rebate Program. It offered up to nine thousand dollars for new leases as compared to the seventy-five hundred that are offered at the federal level under the tax credits. It ended in 82 days. Last year, it was so popular that we ran through the more than six thousand rebates in less than three months,” Hershkowitz stated.

For climate officials, electric vehicle sales are not just about incentives. They emphasize the importance of adoption as Washington faces the challenges of a changing climate. Jennifer Hennessey from the Washington Department of Ecology highlighted the current impacts.

“In Washington, climate change impacts are already here. We’re seeing wildfires around the state and smoke that comes with it, heat waves. This is our third year in a row declaring drought, and all of these impacts are putting lives and livelihoods here in Washington at risk,” Hennessey said.

With the federal tax credit expiring soon, officials are urging buyers ready to switch to electric vehicles not to delay.

“This is definitely going to be a good moment to go out and get an EV,” Hennessey advised.

Even after the credit expires, Washingtonians are expected to continue embracing electric vehicles at a record pace.",https://www.fox28spokane.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6887be412d143.image_.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 07:02:03.827240

Renewable sources of electricity help energy providers move away from relying on dirty fuels, which are known to be harmful to the health of people and the planet. Research by Harvard University links pollution to respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, cancer, reproductive and developmental impacts, and even an increased risk of premature death.

Moving toward energy sources that cause fewer health issues can only be a step in the right direction for a cleaner, safer future. Enormous companies like Amazon getting behind a greener option is heartening to see.

The managing director of Amazon Web Services over much of Southeast Asia, Jeff Johnson, commented per Renewable Energy Magazine: ""We're proud to work with forward-thinking organisations like Gentari who share our commitment to both technological advancement and environmental stewardship.""

He added, ""This collaboration reflects our shared commitment to advancing practical, scalable, and clean energy solutions – vital for Asia and the world's move towards a low-carbon future.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mEkfdvOpVZOatHVhJuQGow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/5499fffb0c0dd27a8b485bc1bf61d4ee,N,,2025-09-07 04:59:14.651158

China has dramatically increased its investment footprint in Brazil's energy landscape, establishing itself as a dominant foreign investor in South America's largest economy. In 2024, Chinese investments in Brazil more than doubled year-over-year, reaching $4.18 billion across 39 projects, with the China investment in Brazil energy sector capturing the largest share of this capital influx. This strategic focus reflects China's dual approach to securing both traditional and renewable resources while expanding its global economic influence.

The power sector, particularly solar and wind projects, received 34% ($1.43 billion) of total Chinese investments in Brazil during 2024, while oil and gas attracted 25% ($1 billion). This balanced approach demonstrates China's pragmatic energy transition trends that simultaneously advances renewable capacity while maintaining access to fossil fuel resources.

What Drives China's Interest in Brazilian Energy Resources?

Strategic Resource Security

China's investment strategy in Brazil is fundamentally driven by resource security concerns. As the world's largest energy consumer, China seeks to diversify its supply sources and reduce vulnerability to market volatility and geopolitical tensions. Brazil offers an attractive combination of established oil production, renewable energy potential, and critical minerals necessary for energy transition technologies.

The investments serve multiple strategic objectives:

Securing long-term access to Brazil's offshore oil reserves

Establishing positions in renewable energy development

Accessing critical minerals like lithium, niobium, and rare earths

Building influence in a major regional economy with significant natural resources

Complementary Energy Policies

Both China and Brazil pursue parallel energy strategies that combine aggressive renewable energy expansion with continued fossil fuel development. Brazil maintains approximately 90% renewable electricity generation (primarily hydropower) while simultaneously expanding its oil production capacity. Similarly, China leads globally in renewable energy deployment while continuing to develop coal, oil, and gas resources.

This policy alignment creates natural investment synergies, allowing Chinese firms to pursue diverse energy projects that match their domestic expertise and strategic priorities. According to a recent analysis by Alvarez & Marsal, this complementary approach has positioned Brazil as China's third-largest investment destination globally.

Which Sectors Receive the Most Chinese Investment?

Renewable Energy Dominance

Since 2007, Chinese companies have invested $77.5 billion across 303 projects in Brazil, with the power sector claiming the largest share at 45% of total investments. Major Chinese energy corporations have established significant positions in Brazil's renewable energy landscape:

China Three Gorges (CTG): Acquired multiple hydroelectric assets and developed solar projects

State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC): Invested in wind and solar facilities

CGN Power: Developed utility-scale solar installations and transmission infrastructure

The Luiz Gonzaga Solar Complex represents one flagship project with substantial Chinese investment, highlighting the scale of renewable energy commitments and battery recycling innovation efforts.

Oil and Gas Strategic Positioning

The oil industry ranks as the second-largest recipient of Chinese investment at 29% of the cumulative total since 2007. Chinese national oil companies have secured stakes in Brazil's prolific pre-salt offshore oil basin, which has driven most of Brazil's production growth in recent years.

These investments provide China with:

Direct access to Brazilian crude oil exports

Participation in production sharing agreements

Technology transfer opportunities in deep-water exploration

Diversification away from Middle Eastern oil dependencies

Critical Minerals and Manufacturing

Beyond direct energy investments, Chinese firms have strategically targeted Brazil's mining sector, focusing on materials essential for the energy transition supply chain. For example, China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group (CNMC) acquired Brazilian firm Mineração Taboca, the country's largest refined tin producer, for $340 million in late 2024.

This acquisition secured access to:

Tin (used in solar panel manufacturing)

Niobium (critical for high-strength steel and superconductors)

Tantalum (essential for electronics and energy storage)

Manufacturing investments have also followed, representing 8% of total Chinese investment since 2007, often supporting energy-related supply chains.

What Are the Recent Investment Trends?

Accelerating Capital Flows

Chinese investment in Brazil energy has shown remarkable acceleration in recent years. The $4.18 billion invested in 2024 represented a 113% increase compared to 2023, while the number of projects grew by 34% year-over-year. This surge has positioned Brazil as the top emerging market destination for Chinese foreign direct investment.

Recent high-profile investments include:

Envision Group's $1 billion sustainable aviation fuel project (2025)

CGN's $529 million combined wind and solar developments (2025)

Multiple transmission infrastructure projects to support renewable integration

Shifting Focus to Energy Transition

While maintaining positions in oil and gas, Chinese investors have increasingly targeted projects supporting Brazil's energy transition. These investments align with Brazil's ""Fuel of the Future"" initiative and its ambition to become a global green energy hub, as reported by China News.

Investments now frequently support:

Local manufacturing of wind turbine components (60-80% locally produced)

Green hydrogen development infrastructure

Electric vehicle supply chain integration

Smart grid and energy storage technologies

What Challenges Do These Investments Face?

Political and Regulatory Risks

Chinese companies consistently identify political risk as their primary concern when investing in Brazil. The country's complex regulatory environment and history of policy shifts create uncertainty, particularly with elections expected in 2026 that could affect the investment strategy insights.

Key risk factors include:

Potential changes to foreign investment regulations

Environmental licensing delays and complications

Local content requirements and labor regulations

Currency volatility affecting project economics

Environmental and Social Considerations

As investments expand into environmentally sensitive areas, Chinese companies face increasing scrutiny regarding environmental and social impacts. This is particularly relevant for investments in:

Amazon basin oil exploration (such as Petrobras' efforts in Foz do Amazonas)

Hydroelectric projects affecting indigenous territories

Mining operations in ecologically sensitive regions

Chinese investors must navigate these complexities while maintaining their strategic objectives and addressing stakeholder concerns.

How Does This Investment Affect Brazil-China Relations?

Economic Integration

China has maintained its position as Brazil's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years, with energy investments deepening this economic relationship. The growing investment ties create mutual dependencies that shape diplomatic and economic relations between the two BRICS nations.

Trade and investment flows have created:

Increased Brazilian commodity exports to China

Growing Chinese manufactured goods imports to Brazil

Technological collaboration in energy sectors

Financial cooperation through development banks

Geopolitical Implications

The strengthening Brazil-China energy partnership carries significant geopolitical implications, particularly as both nations seek to expand their influence in global energy markets and governance structures. Their cooperation represents a major South-South partnership that challenges traditional North-South investment patterns and creates potential trade war impact concerns.

This relationship influences:

Global oil market dynamics

International climate negotiations

Regional economic integration in South America

Multilateral institutions like BRICS and G20

What Does the Future Hold for Chinese Energy Investments in Brazil?

Continued Growth Trajectory

All indicators suggest China investment in Brazil energy will continue their upward trajectory. The complementary nature of their energy strategies, Brazil's abundant resources, and China's capital availability create powerful incentives for ongoing partnership.

Future investment areas likely include:

Expanded offshore oil development

Accelerated utility-scale solar and wind deployment

Green hydrogen production facilities

Battery manufacturing and energy storage

Critical mineral supply chain integration

Strategic Adaptation

As global energy markets evolve, Chinese investments will likely adapt to changing priorities while maintaining core strategic objectives. This may include greater emphasis on technologies supporting electrification, digitalization, and decarbonization while maintaining positions in conventional energy resources.

The investment relationship will continue balancing:

Short-term resource security needs

Long-term energy transition goals

Technological leadership ambitions

Economic and political influence objectives

Conclusion

China's multibillion-dollar investments in Brazil's energy sector represent a sophisticated strategy that secures access to both traditional and renewable resources while expanding economic influence in Latin America's largest economy. The complementary energy policies of both nations create natural investment synergies, despite apparent contradictions between fossil fuel development and renewable energy expansion.

As Brazil positions itself to host the COP30 climate summit while simultaneously pursuing oil production growth, Chinese investment provides crucial capital and technology to advance both conventional and renewable energy development. This partnership will continue shaping global China investment in Brazil energy markets, supply chains, and geopolitical relationships in the coming decades.

The dual focus on securing traditional energy resources while investing heavily in renewables reflects a pragmatic approach to energy transition—one that acknowledges the continuing importance of fossil fuels while building the infrastructure for a lower-carbon future. As this investment relationship evolves, it will significantly influence both countries' energy landscapes and their positions in the global energy order.

Meijer is just one store that has worked to expand its EV charging options. Target, Walmart, Kroger, and Ikea are others, and it's a sign of the times: More than 1 in 5 vehicles purchased this year will be electric.

While the proliferation of charging stations is good news, there is more work to be done. It has become clear that these chargers, which feature thick copper wires inside insulated cables, will continue to be targeted by thieves.

The Biden-Harris administration has said there will be 200,000 chargers available to drivers by the end of the year, but the rollout has been slow.

Watch now: Uber-wealthy couple makes unprecedented move with $300 million land

Ride-hailing company Uber is offering drivers up to $22,000 to buy EVs as we work to decarbonize the transportation sector.

Internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) are powered by gasoline, a source of dirty energy that pollutes the environment, harms our health, and costs more money than electricity. In one year of use, an ICEV releases 2 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), while an EV releases zero, according to Recurrent.

Critics trumpet the outsize pollution that comes with manufacturing an EV — especially the battery — but EVs are still much better for the environment, our well-being, and our wallets than ICEVs over the vehicles' lifetimes.

Despite contributing 14 tCO2e during production — compared to 10 tCO2e for an ICEV — and 26 tCO2e for charging from the grid (which is mostly still powered by gas, coal, and oil), an EV's pollution output is 39 tCO2e over 16 years. On the other hand, an ICEV's tCO2e is 55, more than 58% of which comes from tailpipe pollution.

Thankfully, it seems there's a simple way to prevent EV charging stations from being destroyed.

Administrator Zeldin and I discussed the importance of the EPA cutting excessive regulation.
After the Federal Issues Forum, I walked around the state fair.
The Nebraska State Fair is a yearly reminder of the values that make the Good Life in our state.","One of my biggest priorities as your Senator is hearing directly from Nebraskans. I continue to do what I did as Governor. I travel the state, talk to Nebraskans, and listen to their concerns. Last week, I welcomed hundreds of Nebraskans to my annual Federal Issues Forum at the State Fair in Grand Island. I’m grateful for everyone who attended.

The Federal Issues Forum is an event where we discuss federal issues impacting Nebraskans. This year, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin and Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso joined me. We highlighted solutions to get America back on track. Senate Republicans and the Trump Administration are delivering for Nebraska. We are fighting to protect and promote the Good Life.

Administrator Zeldin and I discussed the importance of the EPA cutting excessive regulation. Nobody cares more about preserving our water, air, and land resources than our farmers and ranchers. They are the original conservationists. What farmers and ranchers want are common-sense rules and regulations that allow them to continue managing their land. That’s what Administrator Zeldin and I are fighting to deliver.

Reining in overregulation means reforming rules like Waters of the United States (WOTUS). In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act. This gave the EPA authority over navigable waters like lakes, rivers, and oceans. Then, the Obama and Biden administrations tried to illegally increase the EPA’s authority. They redefined what navigable waters are. They claimed that navigable waters include roadside ditches, puddles on construction sites, and farm ponds. Last time I checked, those aren’t navigable waters. That’s not what Congress voted for. Administrator Zeldin and I are putting an end to this kind of overreach.

Administrator Zeldin and I also discussed the Renewable Fuel Standard. He previously committed to me that EPA would follow the standard Congress passed. This includes getting the process back on schedule. The EPA’s most recent Renewable Volume Obligations exceeded our expectations. It will drive strong biofuel markets. This will benefit energy consumers with cheaper prices at the pump, help clean up our environment, and be great for our farmers and ranchers. The Biden administration ignored biofuels and weakened American energy independence. We’re unleashing American energy dominance again.

Senator Barrasso and I discussed how the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) strengthens Nebraska families. It’s rare to have the opportunity to pass legislation that preserves the Good Life for generations.

The One Big Beautiful Bill is good for families. It avoids a $2,400 tax hike on the average Nebraska family. OBBB expands the child tax credit. It makes the Death Tax exemption permanent. OBBB expands child and dependent care credits while increasing take-home pay by up to $9,000. It ensures no tax on tips or overtime. 88% of seniors will no longer pay taxes on Social Security due to a new $6,000 tax credit. OBBB includes a $50 billion rural health care fund. This makes sure Nebraska gets a minimum of $100 million each of the next five years. OBBB secures our border. It promotes peace through strength by deterring foreign adversaries like Communist China.

Senator Barrasso and I also discussed historic votes from this Congress. Bipartisan laws like the HALT Fentanyl Act and the Laken Riley Act are keeping Nebraskans safe. We have confirmed 125 of Trump’s nominees. We passed a $9 billion cut to spending.

After the Federal Issues Forum, I walked around the state fair. I spoke with small business owners, fair staff, and Nebraskans enjoying the fair. I saw the ingenuity of Nebraska entrepreneurs at the expo hall. I saw the impressive livestock shown in fair competition by our next generation of farmers and ranchers. I was even able to help show a Rambouillet ram in competition. I also won a blue ribbon!

Nebraska is what America is supposed to be. The reason is our people. As I travel across our state, I’m reminded of the values that make Nebraska special. We’re committed to faith, family, community, and hard work. These values are the same ones that guide my service to Nebraska.

,American Energy,2025-09-07 06:24:50+00:00,Yahoo News,US researchers make key breakthrough in pursuit of next-gen nuclear power - Yahoo,Calvin Coffee,,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/us-researchers-key-breakthrough-pursuit-054500667.html,"Built by X-energy at Oak Ridge in Maryland, the researchers hope to fuel a new wave of nuclear reactors, expected to be operational by 2030, as Tech Xplore reported.
Still, experts caution that nuclear power isn't a clean energy silver bullet.
Therefore, these small TRISO pebbles could have a huge impact by cutting pollution, strengthening U.S. energy security, and potentially lowering costs for consumers.
""The momentum is incredible,"" said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X.
If timelines hold, Americans could see this next generation of nuclear fuel powering homes and businesses before the end of the decade.","At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, researchers are crafting what look like gray pool balls (or pebbles) that may hold the power to usher in a new era of nuclear energy in the U.S.

But inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny uranium particles enriched beyond what today's power plants use.

Built by X-energy at Oak Ridge in Maryland, the researchers hope to fuel a new wave of nuclear reactors, expected to be operational by 2030, as Tech Xplore reported. This includes companies like Standard Nuclear and Orano, producing fuel and enrichment facilities to help reach that goal.

The uranium-based fuel, Tri-structural Isotropic particle fuel or TRISO, inside the pebbles is the ""most robust nuclear fuel on Earth,"" according to the Department of Energy, as it cannot melt in a reactor. Each pebble can cycle through a high-temperature reactor multiple times, making it more efficient and safer than traditional fuel rods.

This breakthrough couldn't come at a more critical time. Nuclear fission, the process of splitting atoms to release energy, is far cleaner than coal or gas, generating large amounts of power without the same level of climate-warming pollution.

But new advanced reactors need advanced fuels, and right now, most of the world's supply chain for high-assay, low-enriched uranium is controlled by Russia and China. X-energy's work represents a push for the U.S. to ramp up domestic production and reduce dependence on foreign sources.

Still, experts caution that nuclear power isn't a clean energy silver bullet. Building new reactors is costly and often delayed. And while TRISO fuel is designed to be safer, it's not unlimited, and all nuclear waste must still be contained and stored securely to avoid disasters to human health and the environment.

Even so, the potential is enormous as we continue to rely more and more on massive amounts of energy to power new technology. If advanced reactors paired with TRISO fuel succeed, they could provide stable, low-carbon power that supports renewables like wind and solar, reducing air pollution and making the grid more resilient against extreme weather and climate.

Therefore, these small TRISO pebbles could have a huge impact by cutting pollution, strengthening U.S. energy security, and potentially lowering costs for consumers.

""The momentum is incredible,"" said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X.

During his holiday in Scotland last month, the US vice-president held private talks with a string of major US nuclear companies about projects they are pursuing in the UK.

Executives from Westinghouse, GE Hitachi, X-energy, Holtec International and TerraPower, the nuclear developer co-founded by Bill Gates, are understood to have attended the meeting.

It was scheduled to last just 20 minutes but ultimately went on for double that amount of time, multiple sources confirmed.

Now with less than a fortnight before the president touches down for his state visit in London, the White House is understood to be lobbying in support of plans for American companies to build nuclear power plants and data centres that could power artificial intelligence (AI) software in the UK.

These include a major nuclear plant proposed by Westinghouse on the island of Anglesey, North Wales, as well as a string of miniature plants that X-energy, the start-up backed by Amazon, wants to build in industrial areas across the country.

Mr Vance’s meeting with nuclear companies is understood to have been billed as a fact-finding mission to explore opportunities for US business in Britain.

But government sources acknowledged that both countries see nuclear energy as key to meeting the massive electricity demands expected to come from AI data centres and are discussing how to work more closely together.

One well-placed British source who is familiar with the discussions said: “The White House wants announcements for Trump to make while he’s here.

“So there is huge pressure to make that happen. But the Government won’t allow that to happen unless there are credible proposals from the nuclear companies on the table.”

On Friday, Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador to Washington, also hinted that deals spanning energy, defence, AI and quantum computing were potentially on the cards, with a view to “create jobs, drive innovation and ensure that British and American ingenuity continues to lead the world”.

While once the preserve of national energy companies, Silicon Valley’s tech giants are piling into nuclear energy because it is seen as the only clean, large and uninterrupted power source capable of meeting the 24/7 needs of data centres.

X-energy is seeking to build an advanced modular reactor (AMR) in Hartlepool, County Durham, with a view to building up to 10 in the UK if it proves successful.

The company is understood to be regarded as highly credible within Whitehall and is in talks about receiving potential debt and equity financing from the National Wealth Fund.

It is also seeking revenue support and guarantees that the Government will follow through on planning reforms that would let nuclear companies build mini reactors near cities.

In June, The Telegraph also revealed that Westinghouse was in talks with the Government about a proposed large nuclear power station at Wylfa, Anglesey.

Westinghouse is pushing for the site to be set aside for the project, which could see it build four large reactors capable of generating almost five gigawatts of electricity – enough to power millions of homes.

The company insists the scheme would be privately financed, and so kept off the Government’s balance sheet, but it is seeking minimum revenue guarantees and £50m to carry out a feasibility study.

However, the proposal has created a potential dilemma for Ed Miliband, the Energy Secretary, as Wylfa is also being eyed as a potential testbed for the first mini nuclear reactors plants designed by Rolls-Royce, which are due to be built by the mid-2030s.

On Friday, a government spokesman declined to comment on talks with the Trump administration, but said: “Over the past year we’ve taken action to deliver a golden age of nuclear for Britain, with record funding for Sizewell C and our first small modular reactors – creating thousands of new, skilled jobs through the Plan for Change.

“No decisions on a future large-scale nuclear project have been made.”

The factory, now shut, was once recognized as a source of lead, chromium and other pollution by state regulators — as well as by concerned locals such as Roxxanne O'Brien.

But as O'Brien focused on fallout from the metals factory on her impoverished north Minneapolis neighborhood, her gaze widened to the many other industrial operations lining the river, each spewing out its own cocktail of pollutants.

""All of these different industries combined were creating a toxic soup,"" O'Brien, a mother of three, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

She refers to these combined pollution levels as ""cumulative impacts"" — when multiple sources of pollution come together and hurt human health.

It is a particular concern in poor, minority areas, she said, citing places such as north Minneapolis, where heavy industry, manufacturing and transport tend to concentrate.

Regulators, meanwhile, have focused on individual operations rather than look at the implications of a concentration of industry in any given area.

But O'Brien, co-founder of a group called Community Members for Environmental Justice, is now hoping she has a solution.

The Frontline Communities Protection Act is a state law that creates a new permitting process for industry in impoverished, minority ""environmental justice"" communities.

The law passed in 2023, and an implementation framework is due by next May.

It’s the country’s third, after New Jersey and New York.

The trend offers a major new tool to address pollution in ""overburdened"" communities that backers say local officials are increasingly taking up.

This comes as President Donald Trump undermines national momentum on the issue through funding cuts and by banning government ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" efforts that could have helped impacted communities stave off pollution.

The Environmental Protection Agency, which in November released an interim framework for a national policy, has now ""paused"" that work, a spokesperson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The Minnesota bill met with pushback from industry groups, including local chambers of commerce and utilities, warning it could stifle economic development or duplicate existing rules.

Yet the need for change is a ""no-brainer,"" said Minnesota state Representative Fue Lee, who spearheaded the law.

""If we have the tools already, why are community members still coming to me to have the state step in?""

Discussion of the cumulative effects of air, water and soil pollution took root in the 1980s and 1990s as communities grew frustrated with regulators' reliance on risk analysis that didn’t reflect the harm they'd witnessed first hand.

More racially segregated areas are up to 75% more likely to have high copper, chromium, lead and other particulate concentrations, with low-income communities suffering higher levels of asthma, diabetes and hypertension, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators.

A facility permit might allow a set level of pollutants but did so without taking into account what other industries were polluting the area, said Ana Baptista, director of the Tishman Environment and Design Center at the New School in New York.

""So communities would be hitting brick walls every time they tried to fight these facilities,"" Baptista said.

She helped get the first such law enacted in New Jersey.

The new law requires regulators to consider the cumulative effects of polluting industries, strengthens their power to win changes and ensure that local voices are part of the process.

While it is too early to gauge the impact, New Jersey regulators in May issued their first decision under the law, on permits for a recycling plant, and ordered changes.

Campaigners applauded that milestone but said ""significantly more could have been done to ensure protections for the surrounding overburdened communities,"" according to the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance, a coalition of groups.

In addition to Minnesota and New York, dozens of states and cities — including Maryland, D.C. and Colorado — have proposed similar laws, according to tracking by the Tishman Center.

The return of Trump has prompted many communities to turn to state legislators for their help, said Baptista, since they no longer feel the federal government will protect them.

In 2019, researchers found that Chicago had a life expectancy gap between racially segregated neighborhoods of 30 years — the country’s widest such discrepancy.

Clustering industries in certain areas had measurable fallout: high levels of cancer, asthma and other respiratory illnesses, said Iyana Simba of the Illinois Environmental Council, an advocacy group that represents 130 groups.

""It's not just one single factory or warehouse. It's these communities that have several in the same area,"" she said.

The mayor and others introduced a cumulative impacts bill in April, for an ordinance that could be voted on in coming weeks.

In Minnesota, negotiations are continuing on how to implement the new law ahead of next May's deadline, with particular focus on the inclusion of ""community benefits.""

That could mean mitigating pollution, paying for the health problems it caused, ringfencing jobs for locals or even helping with housing, said Sasha Lewis-Norelle, an organizer with COPAL, an advocacy group that works with Minnesota’s Latino community.

""It has felt really important to work on these local laws and regulations as we're seeing so many rules from the federal level be taken away,"" he said.",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/09/07/492229.jpg?v=3.1,N,,2025-09-07 07:03:29.207915

A U.S.-based nuclear fusion startup is setting its sights on Japan as a key market for deploying its advanced reactor technology, signaling a potential shift in global energy strategies. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a Massachusetts company backed by tech giants like Nvidia, has initiated discussions with Japanese government officials about bringing its fusion power plants to the island nation. According to reporting in The Japan Times, CFS aims to have a reactor operational in Japan by the late 2030s or early 2040s, aligning with Tokyo’s push for carbon-neutral energy sources.

This move comes amid a surge of investment in fusion energy, with CFS recently securing $863 million in funding from investors including Nvidia, as detailed in the same Japan Times article. The company’s technology revolves around high-temperature superconductors to create compact tokamaks, which could generate electricity from fusion reactions mimicking the sun’s power. Japan, with its history of energy innovation and post-Fukushima caution toward traditional nuclear fission, sees fusion as a safer, cleaner alternative to meet rising demands from data centers and manufacturing.

Investment Surge and Strategic Partnerships

The influx of capital underscores investor confidence in fusion’s viability. CFS’s funding round, highlighted in Bloomberg, positions the firm to accelerate development, potentially outpacing competitors. In Japan, a consortium of 12 companies, including Mitsubishi Corporation and Kansai Electric Power, has invested in CFS, marking the first such involvement from Japanese firms, as reported by Digitimes. This collaboration aims to import technical know-how for domestic commercialization.

For industry insiders, this partnership highlights the interplay between U.S. innovation and Japanese industrial might. Japan’s government has been proactive in fusion, evidenced by the JT-60SA tokamak, a joint EU-Japan project that began operations in 2023, according to the European Commission. CFS’s entry could build on this foundation, integrating American magnet technology with Japan’s precision engineering.

Technological Hurdles and Market Potential

Yet, challenges remain in scaling fusion from experimental to commercial stages. CFS’s approach promises net energy gain, but skeptics point to historical delays in the field. As Reuters noted in coverage of a U.S.-Japan fusion partnership announced earlier this year, bilateral efforts are crucial for overcoming plasma stability and material durability issues.

Japan’s energy needs, driven by AI and electrification, make it an ideal testing ground. A recent Interesting Engineering article discussed Japan’s consideration of new fission reactors, but fusion offers a zero-waste, abundant fuel option using seawater-derived deuterium. CFS executives, per The Japan Times, emphasize regulatory alignment and site selection as next steps.

Global Implications for Energy Transition

The broader implications extend to international energy security. With fusion potentially providing baseload power without greenhouse emissions, CFS’s Japan plans could inspire similar deployments elsewhere. Neutron Bytes reported on CFS’s funding, noting its role in advancing tritium fuel cycles alongside partners like General Atomics.

For insiders, this development signals a maturing fusion sector, where private ventures like CFS are bridging lab breakthroughs to real-world applications.

That's because a Los Alamos National Laboratory-led team has tapped the power of ""THOR,"" according to a news release.

And while there isn't a hammer-wielding god involved, there is potential for plenty of cleaner power thanks to the Thinned Hohlraum Optimization for Radflow diagnostic device. The team was able to achieve ignition through a self-contained feedback loop called burning plasma. It's part of the way our sun continues to burn, according to the release and other government data.

It's also extremely hard to sustain, making fusion energy an as-yet unrealized power source on Earth. But if experts can make a key breakthrough, the reaction could provide nearly unlimited energy. Unlike common fission reactors, fusion doesn't produce long-lasting nuclear waste or carry meltdown risks. Fusion combines atoms to create energy, while fission splits them, according to the Department of Energy.

Powerful lasers creating astounding heat are needed to create ignition, something the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory first achieved in 2022. The extreme settings provide them with a setting to observe how materials respond to severe plasma conditions. And THOR is essentially a better window to look through, per the summary.

As lasers are fired at a gold-coated cylinder holding fusion fuel, a ""bath"" of X-rays is produced that is needed to create ignition. As part of the THOR process, the cylinder, known as a hohlraum, includes ""windows"" that allow some of the X-rays to escape. This technique gives the scientists another look at how materials are reacting to high heat and radiation, according to the release.

""We pulled this off in less than a year because of everyone's commitment. We moved fast and we moved together, showing what can happen when the whole team is aligned and all-in,"" THOR project lead Ryan Lester, a physicist, said.

It's an exciting benchmark in the effort for sustainable fusion energy, as the power comes without heat-trapping air pollution that the World Health Organization said is a health problem for almost everyone on Earth. Indoor and outdoor dirty air is linked to 7 million premature deaths a year, per the WHO. A study has even associated it with dementia risks.

However, there are also nuclear pitfalls. The Los Alamos news release mentioned that the information they are gathering is also of value for weapons development. Experts and advocates on both sides continue to debate the repercussions of nuclear waste, meltdown risks, and the prospect of limitless, cleaner power.

Fission energy, powering 54 plants stateside, is still being developed as growing data center electricity demand strains the power grid.

For its part, fusion could resolve many of the concerns. The THOR project was completed in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the National Ignition Facility. The experts plan to continue refining the diagnostic system, per the release.

""This is a game-changing breakthrough,"" physicist Joseph Smidt said.

Solar energy is another clean energy option that is among the cheapest — second to wind — to develop, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It doesn't provide weapons-related data or create radioactive waste, either.

On a continent where more than 300 million people lack access to safe drinking water, green hydrogen risks becoming water plunder disguised in green labels.","Energy that is hailed as clean demands a vital resource that is missing: water.

The world applauds green hydrogen as the clean energy that will save the planet. It is sold as the invisible gold of the twenty-first century. But there is a truth buried under the propaganda. To produce every kilo of hydrogen, liters and liters of pure water are needed. On a planet already suffering historic droughts, where millions of people lack drinking water, that promise turns into a threat.

The geopolitics of the twenty-first century will not only revolve around minerals and fuels. It will also revolve around water. The same countries that are pushing green hydrogen megaprojects are the ones watching their people dry up. Chile announces plants in Atacama, one of the driest deserts in the world. Namibia and Mauritania hand over land for gigantic projects while their populations still carry buckets of water. Saudi Arabia builds complexes with desalination plants that generate more brine than energy.

The contradiction is brutal. They speak of clean energy, but they hide the water cost. They proclaim the fight against climate change, but they risk deepening the water crisis. What should be a path toward sustainability can become a new form of plunder. Green hydrogen not only divides the world into producers and buyers. It also divides it between those who will have water to live and those who will give up theirs to export molecules.

The water cost of hydrogen

Green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis. A process that splits water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen using renewable electricity. The equation is simple in theory, but brutal in practice. To produce one kilo of hydrogen, between nine and twelve liters of pure water are needed, free of salts and minerals. That water must be treated and demineralized before entering the electrolyzers, which makes the process even more expensive.

The numbers escalate at industrial scale. The International Energy Agency estimates that if the world produces the 530 million tons of green hydrogen projected for 2050, more than five billion cubic meters of water per year will be required, equivalent to the annual consumption of a nation of one hundred million people. In other words, the energy transition based on hydrogen demands a new sacrifice: turning water into exportable energy.

The contradiction is obvious. Projects rise in arid regions where water is scarcest. Chile announces complexes in Atacama and Magallanes. Namibia and Mauritania promise massive exports from the desert. Saudi Arabia pushes its futuristic city Neom based on hydrogen, with desalination plants that generate millions of tons of brine discharged into the sea. They call it progress, but for local communities it is another form of dispossession.

The water cost of green hydrogen opens a new political question. Should water be used to feed electrolyzers or to secure life and agriculture? What right do corporations have to drain rivers and aquifers in the name of an energy that will not even remain in producing countries? At its core, green hydrogen risks being clean only in appearance. Clean in Europe’s and Asia’s carbon accounts, but dirty in the thirst it leaves behind.

Latin America: green energy in dry lands

Latin America is presented as the new Saudi Arabia of green hydrogen. Governments and corporations announce gigantic projects that promise billion-dollar exports to Europe and Asia. But behind the discourse of progress lies a paradox: many of these megaprojects are being built in territories where water is scarce and where millions of people still lack access to the most basic resource.

Chile leads the regional map. In Magallanes, world-scale plants are planned to produce green ammonia and export it to Germany and Japan. In Atacama, the driest desert on the planet, solar parks are being built to power electrolyzers that require thousands of cubic meters of pure water every day. The same country where more than 400,000 people suffer chronic water scarcity is handing over its water to corporations that will generate energy for European ships.

Argentina is not far behind. In Río Negro, the Australian company Fortescue is projecting an $8.4 billion investment to install a green hydrogen hub that will need water resources in a province already under stress. Patagonia, with its wind potential, is turning into the epicenter of a clean energy that risks drying up agricultural valleys.

Brazil and Mexico are moving forward with pilot projects in Ceará, Bahia, and Yucatán—regions where water is limited and contested between human consumption, agriculture, and mining. Figures projected by the International Energy Agency indicate that producing just one million tons of green hydrogen per year consumes more than nine million cubic meters of water, enough to supply a medium-sized city.

The warning is clear. Latin America is giving up water and territory to produce energy it will not consume. Green hydrogen is sold as the key to the future, but in practice it threatens to repeat the history of plunder: cheap raw materials for the north and thirst for the south.

Africa: the desert as a testing ground

Africa is the new laboratory of green hydrogen. In the midst of energy poverty and lack of drinking water, megaprojects are rising that promise to save the planet but may condemn local communities. Namibia is the most brutal example. There, the company Hyphen Energy is pushing a $10 billion complex on the southern coast, aimed at exporting green ammonia to Germany and the Netherlands. The project will use desalinated water, but that desalination will generate tons of brine discharged into the ocean, altering already fragile marine ecosystems.

Mauritania has become the other epicenter. The consortium CWP Global is planning a $40 billion megaproject, one of the largest in the world, also geared toward exports to Europe. The Mauritanian desert, where communities survive with minimal water and electricity, will be converted into an energy extraction zone to supply foreign trains and ships. The paradox repeats itself: countries where more than 40 percent of the population lacks regular access to electricity are giving up their water resources to produce energy they will not consume.

South Africa and Morocco have joined the race. Pretoria announced a hydrogen corridor in Northern Cape, while Rabat signed agreements with the European Union and Germany to be a key supplier in the next decade. Both rely on desalination to sustain production. That technology raises the cost of hydrogen and generates a hidden problem: millions of tons of brine dumped into the sea, impacting fisheries and biodiversity.

The figures are stark. Producing one million tons of green hydrogen per year requires more than nine million cubic meters of water. Namibia, Mauritania, and Morocco aim to multiply that figure tenfold over the next twenty years. On a continent where more than 300 million people lack access to safe drinking water, green hydrogen risks becoming water plunder disguised in green labels.

Asia and the Middle East: water or energy

Asia and the Middle East concentrate the paradox of green hydrogen at its most extreme. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announce gigantic hydrogen plants in the middle of the desert. The flagship project is Neom, the futuristic Saudi city presented as a model of sustainability, which includes the installation of one of the largest hydrogen plants on the planet. Production depends on massive desalination, a process that requires additional energy and discharges millions of tons of highly polluting brine into the Red Sea. Clean energy in theory, but with a toxic environmental trail.

India faces an even more direct dilemma. The government launched a national green hydrogen plan with the goal of producing five million tons annually by 2030. However, much of that production would be located in the arid regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat, where water is already insufficient for agriculture and human consumption. One kilo of hydrogen means ten liters less of water for farmers already enduring chronic droughts. In a country with more than 100 million people without secure access to drinking water, hydrogen can become more of a threat than a solution.

China is also betting big. Its hydrogen megaprojects are concentrated in the north, in areas such as Inner Mongolia, rich in wind and solar power but poor in water. The challenge is obvious: while China leads in electrolyzers, it must guarantee water to sustain large-scale production. The risk is that the energy meant to decarbonize the global economy will end up worsening local water stress.

The figures don’t lie. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, 60 percent of green hydrogen projects in Asia and the Middle East are located in regions with high or extreme water stress. The question becomes unavoidable: what is worth more—water for life, or water turned into fuel for global trade?

Potential conflicts

Green hydrogen is not only an energy bet, it can also become a new motive for water wars. Where historical tensions already exist, the arrival of HV megaprojects threatens to deepen conflicts. The Nile River is a clear example. Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia have spent years disputing control of the Grand Renaissance Dam. If hydrogen production is added in Ethiopia and Sudan, the waters of the Nile will become fuel for export and not a vital resource for 150 million people.

The Indus River in Asia faces a similar situation. India and Pakistan dispute its flow under a fragile sharing agreement. India’s decision to push hydrogen projects in arid regions using Indus water could ignite a new conflict front. The same is happening in the Amazon, where there is already talk of exploring HV projects in Brazil and Peru, in a basin that holds 20 percent of the world’s freshwater and already suffers from deforestation and pollution. Turning that river into an energy input for export would be repeating plunder under another guise.

The numbers put the contradiction in black and white. More than 400 million Africans and 100 million Asians today lack secure access to drinking water. Producing one million tons of green hydrogen per year consumes more than nine million cubic meters of water, enough to supply a city of half a million inhabitants for a year. Water colonialism is taking hold in silence. The north buys green molecules, and the south gives up the water it needs to live. They call it energy transition, but it smells like the same old story: exporting life and staying with thirst.

Alternatives and solutions

Green hydrogen does not have to be a water plunder. There are technological and political alternatives that could prevent the energy of the future from being built on the thirst of the people.

The first option is to look to the sea. New electrolyzers designed to operate directly with seawater reduce dependence on freshwater sources. The technology is still expensive, but it is advancing quickly. Researchers in China and Australia have already tested prototypes that produce hydrogen without the need for desalination.

The second alternative is the reuse of wastewater. Cities that today dump millions of liters of treated water into the sea could redirect part of that flow to hydrogen production. Germany and Japan are already developing pilots along these lines. The cost is lower than desalination and avoids tensions with agriculture and human consumption.

The third solution is not technical but political. Water justice must be a principle of the energy transition. No hydrogen project should advance if it compromises access to drinking water for local communities. The priority must be clear: life first, export second.

The numbers show viability. Using wastewater could cover up to 15 percent of the projected water demand for hydrogen by 2030. Direct seawater electrolysis could reduce operating costs by 20 percent if scaled up industrially. These are figures that prove this is not science fiction, but political will and real investment.

The dilemma is clear. Hydrogen can be the excuse to deepen water colonialism, or it can be the impulse for a just and sustainable energy transition. It all depends on who sets the rules: the banks and corporations of the north, or the peoples who put their water at stake.

Green hydrogen is announced as the key to a clean future. But behind every electrolyzer beat the rivers, the aquifers, and the communities that feed it. There will be no just transition if water becomes a commodity to produce molecules destined to light up distant cities while entire peoples continue carrying jugs just to drink.

The history of energy colonialism may repeat itself in another disguise. First it was gold, then oil, now it may be water turned into hydrogen. The discourse changes, the logic remains. The south delivers what is vital, the north keeps the benefit. They call it green energy, but it may end up being blue plunder, hidden in liters of water evaporated in silence.

And yet, not everything is written. Technologies exist that can use seawater and urban waste. Social movements already raise their voices to demand water justice. Governments could still put sovereignty above contracts signed on their knees. Hope is not naivety, it is memory. The peoples who survived past colonialism know they can resist the colonialism of the future.

Green hydrogen can be a mirage or a real opportunity. It can dry out the planet or give it a breath. The decision is not in tanks or ports. It is in the hands of those who must choose between selling the water of life or defending it as a human right.

And that choice will define whether the energy of tomorrow will be liberation or condemnation.

The EV revolution has taken a huge hit since the failed US president brought his team of fossil fuel champions to Washington. Emissions rules? Gone. EV tax credits? Gone. Funding for EV chargers? Gone — although, most of it was later restored. EVs are now viewed as part of the “green new scam” touted by America’s Dear Leader and his jock-sniffing coterie of sycophants.

It’s not just the US that is affected. The malevolence against electric cars in the US has been a disaster for foreign automakers. Volkswagen this week announced it will furlough 160 employees at its ID.4 factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as demand for the car has evaporated. Although everyone in the industry expects EV sales to break records in September as buyers race to get their orders in before September 30, which is when the federal tax incentive ends, after that, sales of electric cars are expected to plummet, and how long will it be before Americans begin to embrace them again is a matter of intense speculation.

Canada Ditches EV Mandate

This week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rescinded a policy put in place by his predecessor that would require automakers in Canada to sell a certain percentage of electric cars beginning next year. According to Bloomberg, the move is designed to support domestic manufacturers whose business has been upended by the cockamamie tariff wars initiated by Washington.

Under the Trudeau plan, 20 percent of new cars sold in Canada in 2026 would need to be electric, rising to 100 percent by the end of 2035. “These targets were made up by the government, not based on any sound assessment of real market dynamics,” Brian Kingston, CEO of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, said in an interview in August.

An Engine For All Seasons

So, what are manufacturers who have designed battery electric cars supposed to do now that the bloom is off the EV rose? Horse Powertrain, a joint venture between Renault and Geely, says it has the answer — an ultra-compact engine and integrated generator it says can be retrofitted to any EV to help calm the fears of customers who are still freaked out by charging anxiety.

A year ago, Horse Powertrain introduced a compact electric motor that can be added to virtually any conventional car to boost its efficiency. Next week at the IAA auto show in Munich, if you stop by booth B40 in hall A2, you can see its latest creation.

That may seem like a stretch to most of us. The engine may be diminutive, but there are things like gas tanks and exhaust systems that need to be fitted as well. Horse Powertrain suggests those niggling issue can be overcome. Perhaps they can.

The company slyly suggests its C15 engine is small enough to fit into a briefcase. Actually, it measures 19.7 x 21.7 x 11 inches (50 x 55 x 28 cm). Perhaps briefcases are bigger in Europe and China than they are in the US, but give the company credit for some creative marketing. If you call it a suitcase engine, everyone will want to see it, which is pretty much the point of all marketing.

In a press release, the company says “the C15 integrates an engine, generator, and inverter into a unit compact enough to be fitted within existing battery electric vehicle (BEV) platforms with little to no modification. This allows OEMs to easily and efficiently convert a BEV platform into a range extended EV (REEV), allowing them to expand their product line-ups to meet local market demands.”

Matias Giannini, CEO of Horse Powertrain, said: “Range extended EVs are the fastest-growing powertrain category in many global markets. The Horse C15 range extender solution offers OEMs a straightforward and cost effective way to tap into this opportunity, and adapt their native BEV platforms into REEVs.

“We believe demand for REEVs will continue to grow. Horse C15 will play a critical role in this transition, as one of the market’s most efficient and flexible REEV solutions to date. It also underlines our commitment and ability to support OEMs in delivering a full range of EVs, hybrids, and combustion platforms.”

The C15 has been designed for Euro 7 compliance, including China 7 and SULEV 20. It will be available in naturally aspirated form for B and C segment vehicles, with maximum engine power of up to 70 kW (93 hp). For larger D segment vehicles and commercial vehicles, the addition of a turbocharger increases power output up to 120 kW (161 hp).

The little engine is able to run on gasoline, ethanol or methanol flex fuels, and synthetic fuels. In all applications, the range extender maintains the charge level of the battery used to power the drive motor of an EV. By adding the C15 to an existing model, the manufacturer can elect to use a smaller battery, which could lower the price of the vehicle and make it more appealing to customers.

By definition, the C15 never powers the vehicle’s wheels directly, which allows it to operate as efficiently as possible to minimize fuel consumption and emissions, while keeping noise, vibration, and harshness to a minimum.

Splitting The Difference

Writing in New Atlas, C.C. Weiss summed up the Horse Powertrain phenomenon succinctly. “Horse has always struck us as a company just over the right side of the thin wire fence dividing genius from insanity. Had it debuted a couple of years earlier, when the automotive world had its head down toward going 110% all-in on electric vehicles, it would have struck us as a bit insane, or at least too little, too late.

“But having ramped up at a time when governments and automakers worldwide are rethinking those EV plans and timelines, it seems to be perfectly positioned for a renaissance in hybrid technology. For now, at least.”

We agree. The debate about hybrid, plug-in hybrid, series vs parallel, extended range, and battery electric cars has been raging for nearly 15 years. We confess that here at CleanTechnica, most of us have always laughed at manufacturers who couldn’t make up their minds about what direction the market — and government polices — were likely to go in the future, and so designed their platforms to accept a variety of powertrains.

We thought that was nuts because anyone with more than a 4th grade education could see that EVs were the future. By relying on such multi-dimensional chassis configurations, they are denying their customers some of the important benefits of an EV, such as more interior space for people and stuff, more “cab forward” designs, and worst of all — no frunk!

But as things have developed, the companies that allowed themselves such flexibility may be better positioned for the markets of today. Tomorrow can always take care of itself, we suppose.

It pains us to admit we might have gotten too far out over our skis when it comes to promoting the EV revolution and wishing the S curve would hurry up to work its magic. The biggest factor, of course, other than the whiplash of changes in policy, is that in many places — particularly in the US — EV prices are still significantly higher than they are for conventional cars. That has to change before the EV revolution becomes unstoppable.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/C15-top.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 01:58:53.026868

The arrival of power changed everything.

The 48-year-old now uses hair dryers. The village pharmacy stocks vital medicines requiring refrigeration. More jobs were created as trading and transport picked up.

“These are the kinds of businesses that drive economies,” World Bank President Ajay Banga said in an interview with The Associated Press during a July visit to tour electrification projects and meet entrepreneurs like Guambe. “Electricity isn’t just light, it’s a chance.”

Mozambique has won World Bank backing for the $6 billion Mphanda Nkuwa hydroelectric plant, southern Africa’s biggest such project in 50 years.

Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries by per capita income, aims to connect all of its 33 million mostly rural citizens to electricity by 2030, largely through renewable energy from hydroelectric, solar and other sources.

The challenge is similar in much of sub-Saharan Africa, home to 85% of the global population living without power, according to the World Bank.

Electricity access in Mozambique has nearly doubled from 31% in 2018 to 60% in 2024. The state-run energy supplier Electricidade de Moçambique, or EDM, says it connected 563,000 homes in 2024 and plans to reach 600,000 this year.

“Mozambique has the resources, gas, hydro, solar, and it’s already the biggest supplier of excess power to southern Africa,” Banga said.

His visit came with fanfare, and political undertones. President Daniel Chapo, who took office after a disputed 2024 election, raised his fist to cheering crowds.

Located 60 kilometers (37 miles) downstream from the even larger Cahora Bassa hydroelectric dam along the Zambezi river, the Mphanda Nkuwa plant is expected to generate 1,500 megawatts when it begins operations in 2031. That will help a region facing a 10,000-megawatt deficit that keeps millions from accessing power.

The World Bank is not financing the project outright.

Global energy firm TotalEnergies, French utility Électricité de France and Mozambique’s Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa will develop the plant. The World Bank is providing a mix of support including concessional funding for legal and environmental issues and transmission lines, partial risk guarantees and political risk insurance.

Banga said this approach in Africa aims to move away from reliance on donors for high-impact projects. It coincided with a global shift in development funding. With the Trump administration dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, multilateral lenders like the World Bank are stepping in, often emphasizing private sector–led growth.

“Many shareholders, even in Europe, are reducing their overseas development assistance budgets because they have to divert the money to defense and their own needs. This is the way it is,” Banga said.

Mphanda Nkuwa could also help Mozambique earn critical foreign exchange through exports of electricity to neighbors like South Africa and Zimbabwe. It is among several large hydropower projects aiming to reshape Africa’s energy future.

Ethiopia is preparing to inaugurate its $4 billion Grand Renaissance Dam, which will eventually generate over 5,000 megawatts, doubling the nation’s power output despite fierce opposition from Egypt. In Congo, the World Bank is backing the huge Inga 3 project that could also send electricity to South Africa, Nigeria and others.

Yet hydropower — the world’s largest source of renewable electricity — remains mostly untapped in Africa, with the World Bank and the International Hydropower Association estimating around 90% of capacity is still unused.

And building a mega-dam is only part of the challenge in Mozambique.

“Our country is quite big, and it’s not so easy to go everywhere with the national grid,” said EDM chairman Joaquim Ou-Chim. “So it’s off-grid solutions, mainly driven by solar.”

About 10% of electricity access in Mozambique comes from off-grid projects, and more are being rolled out.

Evaristo Cumbane, an energy consultant based in Maputo, said large projects like Cahora Bassa and Mphanda Nkuwa are important but stressed the need for smaller, local sources of energy.

“We are talking about plenty of rivers, plenty of sunshine, plenty of wind, plenty of coastlines,” he said, adding that “the real Mozambique is in rural, remote areas.”

Cumbane also urged caution over Mozambique’s growing debt burden. Public debt rose to about $17 billion in the first quarter of 2025. A record $2.1 billion was spent in 2023 in debt service, according to the Finance Ministry.

“The World Bank is not a godfather, it is not god. The guy is here on business. These are not donations,” he said.

It was not clear how much new debt is involved in the Mphanda Nkuwa hydroelectric project. Banga said the project’s final cost is yet to be determined but estimated $5 billion to $6 billion.

Mozambique’s path has been complicated. Since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, it has seen civil war, flare-ups of fighting following a peace deal and an ongoing Islamist insurgency in the north that forced TotalEnergies to halt a $20 billion gas project, though it hopes to restart operations.

But for Mozambicans, Guambe’s buzzing barbershop is proof of what’s possible when power reaches the people.

In another impoverished neighborhood outside Maputo visited by Banga, 38-year-old Aurélio Arlindo has been unemployed for years and lives without electricity. But new power poles signal hope.

“It’s really coming. I am just waiting,” he said, and he hopes to open a cold drinks stall.

The mirrors tilt to varying degrees throughout the day, tracking the sunrays and projecting them onto a tower. The tower houses a receiver that absorbs intense heat, boils water and produces high-pressure steam. This is then converted into 50 megawatts of electricity — enough to power over 40,000 households for 24 hours.

The KHI Solar One project is one of many looking to add renewable energy to South Africa's power grid, which is heavily reliant on coal-fired power stations.

However, as hundreds of delegates prepare to gather in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa for the Africa Climate Summit this week, it's clear that many more such projects are needed to bring electricity to millions of people on the continent who need it and to fight the impacts of climate change.

Africa's energy needs

According to the International Energy Agency, about 600 million people on a continent of some 1.5 billion live without electricity, leaving children without lights to study at night and homes without power for appliances.

The World Bank estimates that Central and West Africa have some of the world’s lowest electrification rates. In West Africa, where 220 million people have no electricity, the electrification rate is as low as 8%.

The lack of electricity also limits the continent's access to quality health care, education and economic growth brought about by a sufficient and uninterrupted power supply.

The continent's embracing of renewable energy has been slow when compared to more developed economies like China, European countries and the U.S., which account for 80% of renewable power capacity installed worldwide.

Only 1.5% of installed renewable power capacity is in Africa.

Renewable energy potential in Africa

According to a report by the United Nations released in July, Africa has 60% of the world's best solar resources with the continent's deserts and warm climate creating massive potential for solar projects.

Despite this, Africa received just 2% of global clean energy investments in 2024.

At a climate summit in January this year, African leaders committed to bringing renewable energy capacity in Africa to 300 gigawatts by 2030. That amount of power equals the output of about 114 large power stations — enough to power a large city or a small country. Meanwhile, the International Renewable Energy Agency projects that 90% of Africa's power could be generated from renewables including solar by 2050.

This includes other renewable energy sources besides solar, with countries like South Africa opting for an energy mix that includes hydropower and wind energy.

China's rising solar exports to Africa

Some recent analysis of Chinese export data has shown that exports of solar panels to Africa have increased significantly over the last 12 months.

A report by energy think tank Ember notes that imports from China rose 60% in the last year to 15,032 megawatts, with 20 African countries setting a record for imports of solar panels in a 12-month period.

While the surge in solar panels had previously been buoyed by imports by South Africa, which went through years of power blackouts due to a lengthy electricity crisis, imports of solar panels from outside of South Africa tripled in the last 12 months.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HuQ.Z1jYEg.sNIwg1x2a5g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/ddaa0e404cd17be1dbd648bb10e4766d,N,,2025-09-07 07:02:56.504986

Along with Jackson County, the first awardee, Spencer will be on the receiving end of a program that provides local governments with private funding to address environmental barriers, preparing rail-served properties for new industrial uses that attract investment and create lasting jobs.

“Not every job-creating site begins as a blank slate,” said Carl Warren, NCRR president and CEO. “We help communities overcome early redevelopment hurdles, unlocking the potential of rail-served properties.”

Brownfields are sites hindered by environmental concerns that can complicate redevelopment. NCRR’s program helps communities take critical, initial steps toward entry into the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) Brownfields Program, positioning sites for remediation, industrial investment and job creation.

“NCRR is helping communities turn yesterday’s challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities by preparing rail-served sites for new industry and lasting jobs,” said Trish Haver, NCRR’s chief commercial officer.

Spencer plans to facilitate transformation of a property at 2555 North U.S. Highway 29, once a textile dyeing and finishing facility, into a rail-accessible industrial site, attracting investment and expanding job opportunities. NCRR awarded the municipality $99,800 in grant funding, with a 20-percent match, or nearly $20,000, provided by Samet Corporation.

“This funding helps us partner with property owners and redevelopment professionals to ready a site that has remained inactive and largely untouched for roughly 25 years,” Spencer Town Manager Peter Franzese said. “By preparing this property for industrial use, we hope to identify new possibilities for investment and quality jobs in our community, while addressing a site that has long stood as a reminder of one of North Carolina’s most significant economic challenges.”

Jackson County received $92,000 to assess a 42-acre former sawmill site at 3636 Skyland Drive in Sylva which closed in early 2024. The county will provide a 20-percent match toward the $115,000 project, which will fund environmental assessment and remediation planning. The goal is to repurpose the property for future industrial use.

“This project allows Jackson County to transform a recently closed sawmill into new opportunities for our people and our future,” said Kevin King, Jackson County manager. “With NCRR’s support, we are preparing the site for industry, rail access and workforce training. These investments will create good jobs and long-term prosperity for families across Western North Carolina.”

To ensure long-term impact, the railroad company requires that supported sites:

• Enter the NCDEQ Brownfields Program as part of redevelopment planning.

• Use grant funds within two years of the award for on-site remediation.

• Secure a company that will move at least 40 rail cars annually for five years; if not, partial repayment may be required.

For investors, the U.S. natural gas sector presents a compelling case study in how strategic infrastructure development and regional production shifts can create long-term value.

Production Growth and Regional Drivers

U.S. dry natural gas production has defied expectations of decline, surging to 107.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in June 2025—a 4.5% increase compared to June 2024 and the highest monthly output since 1973 [1]. This growth is underpinned by robust performance in key shale basins. The Permian Basin, for instance, added 2 Bcf/d in 2025 alone, while the Haynesville and Appalachia regions each contributed an additional 0.9 Bcf/d [2]. These gains reflect a strategic reallocation of drilling rigs to gas-rich plays, with the Haynesville region seeing an 18% increase in active rigs between April and August 2025 [2].

The EIA forecasts that 2025 production will average 106 Bcf/d, a 3% rise from 2024 levels, with growth sustained by new infrastructure. The Louisiana Energy Gateway pipeline, set to expand takeaway capacity in the Haynesville region, and LNG export projects like Golden Pass and Plaquemines LNG Phase 2 are critical to unlocking future output [2].

Demand Resilience and Export Dynamics

Despite flat domestic consumption, U.S. natural gas demand remains resilient due to its role in power generation and industrial processes. However, the true driver of demand is the global LNG market. Exports are projected to rise by 2 Bcf/d in 2025–2026, tightening supply-demand balances and supporting price stability [2]. This trend is amplified by Europe’s continued reliance on U.S. LNG to replace Russian imports and Asia’s seasonal demand spikes, particularly in Japan and South Korea.

Price Resilience and Investment Implications

Natural gas prices have exhibited remarkable seasonal resilience, with the Henry Hub price averaging $3.60 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the second half of 2025 and projected to climb to $4.30/MMBtu in 2026 [2]. This upward trajectory is fueled by infrastructure bottlenecks—such as constrained takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin—and the ramp-up of LNG export facilities. For investors, this volatility underscores opportunities in midstream assets, such as pipelines and processing facilities, which are essential to monetizing production gains.

Strategic Investment Opportunities

Shale Plays and Drilling Efficiency: The Permian, Haynesville, and Appalachia basins remain high-conviction areas. The Permian’s associated gas production, driven by record crude oil output, is expected to add 11.5 Bcf/d in 2025 [4]. Operators with strong acreage in these regions and access to capital-efficient drilling technologies will outperform.

Midstream Infrastructure: Projects like the Matterhorn Express Pipeline and Louisiana Energy Gateway are critical to alleviating bottlenecks and enabling production growth. These assets offer stable cash flows and long-term value as they connect supply hubs to export terminals.

LNG Export Facilities: With global demand for cleaner energy intensifying, new LNG terminals will become pivotal. The EIA estimates that U.S. LNG exports could reach 12 Bcf/d by 2026, creating a tailwind for companies involved in terminal construction and operations [2].

Conclusion

The U.S. natural gas market is undergoing a transformation, characterized by production growth, infrastructure innovation, and export-driven demand. While 2026 may see production stabilize, the long-term outlook—projected to reach 120 Bcf/d by 2040—remains bullish [5]. For investors, the key lies in aligning with regions and sectors poised to benefit from this structural shift.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 01:59:55.387980

The bigger problem is that, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office, Canada’s federal and provincial governments – mainly Ontario and Quebec – have earmarked up to $52.5 billion to subsidize 13 major Electric Vehicle supply chain projects, 14% more than the $46.1 billion the EV industry in Canada is spending on itself.

While most of these subsidies have yet to be paid, these governments have a huge financial stake of taxpayers’ money in the eventual success of the EV industry, with some projects already delayed because of lower-than-expected EV sales due to higher costs to consumers compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, a shortage of public charging stations and reduced range in cold weather.

Canada to stall electric vehicle rules as Carney seeks to boost auto sector

Poilievre accuses PM of flip-flopping on gas, diesel car ban

ELBOWS DOWN: Carney sees popularity drop, Tories still leading Liberals

When Carney announced his decision to cancel the 20% mandate for new EV sales in 2026 on Friday, he said the government will conduct a 60-day review of future mandates of 60% of new car sales being EVs by 2030 and 100% by 2035.

He said this will “consider potential amendments to the annual sales targets,” as well as “explore possible additional flexibilities” to ensure government programs promoting EV sales “reflect market realities, remain effective for Canadians” and do not “place undue burden on automakers.”

Aside from responding to the public’s declining interest in EVs in a time of economic uncertainty, rising unemployment and cost-of-living concerns, Carney is responding to warnings from the auto sector that its unrealistic EV mandates would further damage Canada’s struggling auto sector, which employs almost 550,000 Canadians in direct and indirect jobs.

Carney’s cancellation of the consumer carbon tax and his postponement of the 2026 EV mandate – both Justin Trudeau-era policies – while welcome, are baby steps compared to what really needs to be done.

They are only two of more than 140 federal government programs, administered by 13 federal departments and agencies, that as of 2023 had committed more than $200 billion of taxpayers’ money to address climate change.

Independent evaluations – for example, by the federal environment commissioner and PBO – have concluded they will fall far short of achieving Canada’s target of reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions to at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2050.

RECOMMENDED VIDEO

According to the latest government data from 2023, emissions were down only 8.5%.

The problem with these unrealistic federal targets is that they lead to unattainable and costly policies, such as the now-cancelled mandate that EVs had to reach 20% of all new car sales by next year.

A report by federal environment commissioner Jerry DeMarco following an audit of the Liberals’ Net Zero Emissions Accountability Act last year concluded the government’s lack of transparency made it impossible for the average citizen to understand, much less believe, its claim it will reduce Canada’s emissions by at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030.

In examining a sampling of 20 government measures to reduce emissions, it found only nine were on track to achieve their goals.

Of 32 additional measures the government claimed would help boost reductions from 36.2% to at least 40% in 2030, only seven were new.

An investigation last year by Auditor General Karen Hogan of the now-disbanded, $1-billion Sustainable Development Technology Fund, which audited a sampling of the projects it funded, found 90 cases where conflict-of-interest rules were not followed in awarding $76 million worth of government contracts and 10 examples where $56 million was awarded to ineligible projects.

It’s not just the Liberal government’s EV mandates that needs to be critically assessed. So does its entire $200-billion program to address climate change.

Carney has taken a small step in the right direction by cancelling the EV sales mandate for next year but if that’s where it ends, it won’t save taxpayers from a looming financial disaster.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/V0xQ40JHrl8Lgilf0ZyN_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/toronto_sun_articles_263/cabfad009b6747995825da0a2a935701,N,,2025-09-07 01:59:48.059612

Black Hollow Sun I delivers clean energy to Platte River Power Authority, powering thousands of local homes

SEVERANCE, Colo. — A major milestone for renewable energy in Northern Colorado arrived this week as ContourGlobal announced the start of operations at Black Hollow Sun I (BHS I), a 185-megawatt solar facility located just east of Fort Collins.

The project, the company’s first renewable facility in the United States, is delivering electricity directly to Platte River Power Authority, which serves Fort Collins, Loveland, Estes Park, and Longmont. Once complete in 2026, the two-phase Black Hollow Sun complex will be the largest photovoltaic installation in Northern Colorado, producing enough power to supply more than 73,000 homes while offsetting nearly 450,000 metric tons of CO₂ emissions annually.

Regional Impact

BHS I created a significant economic boost during construction, generating about 450 direct jobs and 250 indirect jobs for skilled workers and regional partners across Weld County and surrounding communities. With BHS II already under construction, more opportunities for local contractors, suppliers, and service providers are expected over the next year.

The clean power produced by the project will strengthen the resilience of Northern Colorado’s electric grid while supporting the community-owned Platte River Power Authority’s commitment to reliable, low-carbon energy.

Looking Ahead

ContourGlobal leaders say this development is part of a larger U.S. strategy to expand renewable energy investments. American-manufactured solar modules provided by Qcells are being used in the project, underscoring both domestic supply partnerships and long-term sustainability goals.

The company has also shown its commitment to community engagement, recently sponsoring the Severance Days Festival, strengthening ties with the growing town located just 16 miles from Fort Collins.

Robotic arms swing methodically, while digital screens display real-time production data.

The park has established a complete industrial chain covering research and design, manufacturing and quality testing, according to He Changguo, manager of the firm's northern regional manufacturing center. Since 2008, wind turbines produced in the park have been deployed in more than 100 projects across China.

This facility epitomizes the accelerating pace of Inner Mongolia's green transition. Rich in coal and central to China's energy supply, the region accounted for more than one-quarter of the nation's coal output in 2024. This wealth of resources fueled decades of growth but also tied the region to high-polluting and resource-heavy industries.

In recent years, however, the nationwide low-carbon push has set the region on a new course. By tapping its abundant wind and solar resources, the region is cultivating fresh momentum for growth. Once renowned for its coal reserves and desert environment, Inner Mongolia is now dotted with vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines.

So far, over 30 companies similar to Ming Yang Smart Energy Group, which operate full industrial chains in the new energy sector, have taken root in the region. In 2024, the added value of large-scale new energy and related industries rose by 20.1 percent compared with 2023, and that of new energy equipment manufacturers surged 42.4 percent year on year.

Gong Mingzhu, director of the regional Development and Reform Commission, said Inner Mongolia has established a comprehensive industrial chain for wind, solar, hydrogen and energy storage equipment manufacturing, effectively positioning the region to embark on a new chapter in industrial development.

As new energy industries gain momentum, Inner Mongolia is also transforming its traditional coal-based sectors, shifting from simple extraction toward a more diversified and cleaner industrial system.

A plant in Ordos exemplifies this transformation. Built by Inner Mongolia Baofeng Coal-based New Material Co., Ltd., the facility synthesizes olefins -- a class of chemical compounds serving as key raw materials for industrial products from plastics to textiles and aerospace components -- from coal.

With an annual production capacity of 3 million tonnes, this facility stands as the world's largest single-site coal-to-olefins project, according to the company.

Notably, the plant employs green hydrogen at scale to replace fossil fuels in olefin production, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 6.3 million tonnes annually.

In 2024, Inner Mongolia's modern coal chemical industry output exceeded 100 billion yuan (about 14.07 billion U.S. dollars), while the region ranked first nationwide in both coal-to-gas and coal-to-olefin production capacities.

""Simply mining and selling coal cannot fully realize the value of Inner Mongolia's energy endowment, nor can it meet the requirements of building a modern country,"" said Hu Chengdong, deputy director of the regional energy bureau.

It is imperative for Inner Mongolia to transition from an extractive growth model, shift from factor-driven to innovation-driven development, and propel traditional industries toward higher efficiency and greater value, Hu added. ■",,N,,2025-09-06 22:02:46.662188

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.

Tesla has proposed a new pay package for Elon Musk, potentially making him the world's first trillion-dollar executive if he meets aggressive targets, including significant increases in car production, share price, and operating profit. However, Tesla faces challenges such as declining sales in Europe due to Musk's political affiliations and intensifying competition from rivals like BYD.

The world's richest man could become its first trillionaire if Elon Musk hits a series of extremely aggressive targets for his electric car company over the next decade, according to a proposed pay package released by the company.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world's first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.

Musk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world's most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company's compensation committee - not least because of Tesla's main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk's foray into right-wing politics.

""It doesn't matter how much money he gets. He can't help himself,"" said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high. ""And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.""

To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world's first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world's most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.

Live Events

Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.

Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years. He is currently estimated to be worth more than $400 billion by Forbes magazine.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German. Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla's 0.7%.

Without a reversal of those trends, meeting the financial goals could prove especially difficult. In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Even bulls on the stock are not convinced the new pay incentive will keep Musk, who frequently posts on his X social media platform, from saying things that alienate potential buyers.

Said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, ""Fixing the Musk brand damage remains a work in progress."" Even so, Ives told clients, ""We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk.""

In January 2024, a Delaware judge threw out Musk's previous pay package, worth $44.9 billion at the time. Investors voted to restore that compensation package at Tesla's last shareholders meeting on June 13 of last year. But late last year the package was revoked for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling. Last month, Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of ""transformative and unprecedented"" growth - despite the drop in sales and profits - and noting that the CEO hadn't been paid in years.

The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package. Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. Musk has said that he needed more shares and control so he couldn't be ousted by shareholder activists. If he does hit all the goals, Musk would own about quarter of the company's shares, up from 13% today.

Tesla's stock nearly 3% in afternoon trading.

BP is seeking a development consent order (DCO), which is required for nationally significant infrastructure projects, for a blue hydrogen plant on the Teesworks site in Redcar.

The government had been set to make its decision by 28 August, but this has now been pushed back to 30 October to ""allow time to request further information"", according to MP Miatta Fahnbulleh.

Since BP first announced its plans, landowners South Tees Group (STG) has sought permission for the data centre.

If the hydrogen plant is approved, BP would be given the power to compulsorily purchase the land it needs.

But STG now has different plans for the site and wants to build a giant AI data centre on it instead.

Teesworks is run as a joint venture between the publicly-owned and funded South Tees Development Corporation, led by the Tees Valley Combined Authority (TVCA), and two Teesside businessmen, Martin Corney and Chris Musgrave.

The men initially owned 50% of the shares of Teesworks, but that was raised to 90% in 2021 with the remaining 10% staying in public hands.

BP has said the plant would be one of the UK's largest blue hydrogen facilities and represent more than 10% of the government's hydrogen production target by 2030.

But in a letter detailing its opposition to BP's plans, STG claimed the proposed data centre, which was approved by Redcar and Cleveland Council in the summer, was of ""critical national importance"".

For renewable energy investors, the pause raises questions about the alignment of Canada’s energy transition with its automotive policy.
A slowdown in EV sales could indirectly weaken the business case for renewable energy projects, particularly those tied to grid modernization and battery storage.
Opportunities in Alternative Clean Energy While the EV mandate pause may dampen short-term momentum for battery electric vehicles, it opens avenues for alternative clean energy pivots.
Global investment in clean energy is projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025, dwarfing fossil fuel investments [6].","The Canadian government’s decision to pause its 2026 electric vehicle (EV) mandate has sent ripples through the automotive and renewable energy sectors, creating a complex landscape of strategic risks and opportunities for investors. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s move, announced amid escalating trade tensions with the United States and domestic industry lobbying, suspends a policy that would have required 20% of new light-duty vehicle sales to be zero-emission by 2026. While the long-term targets of 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035 remain intact, the immediate pause reflects a recalibration of priorities in the face of economic headwinds [1].

Strategic Risks for Investors

The automotive sector, particularly automakers and dealers, has welcomed the pause as a necessary reprieve from what they describe as unrealistic targets. The Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) has praised the decision, arguing that the mandate’s aggressive timelines risked affordability crises and supply chain disruptions [2]. However, this pause introduces uncertainty for EV infrastructure investment. According to a report by BloombergNEF, Canada’s EV charging network expansion had already lagged behind its climate goals, with only 12% of required charging stations operational as of mid-2025 [3]. The suspension of the 2026 mandate may further delay private-sector commitments to infrastructure, as companies reassess the viability of long-term projects.

For renewable energy investors, the pause raises questions about the alignment of Canada’s energy transition with its automotive policy. The federal government’s Clean Electricity Strategy, which aims to position Canada as a global leader in low-carbon technologies, relies on robust EV adoption to drive demand for clean power [4]. A slowdown in EV sales could indirectly weaken the business case for renewable energy projects, particularly those tied to grid modernization and battery storage.

Opportunities in Alternative Clean Energy

While the EV mandate pause may dampen short-term momentum for battery electric vehicles, it opens avenues for alternative clean energy pivots. The government’s 60-day review of the EV Availability Standard (EVAS) has already sparked discussions about biofuels and hydrogen as complementary technologies. For instance, the Canadian Renewable Fuels Association has lobbied for expanded incentives for biofuel integration, which could diversify the country’s decarbonization strategy [5].

Investors may also find opportunities in the renewable energy sector’s broader resilience. Global investment in clean energy is projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025, dwarfing fossil fuel investments [6]. Canada’s Green Bond Program, which has raised over $11 billion since 2023, continues to fund projects in solar, wind, and grid modernization, even as EV policy evolves [7]. Additionally, the federal government’s $5-billion Strategic Response Fund, designed to cushion industries against U.S. trade pressures, could redirect capital toward innovation in low-carbon manufacturing and energy storage [8].

Balancing the Scales: A Call for Flexibility

The pause underscores the need for policy flexibility in a rapidly shifting economic and technological landscape. While environmental advocates warn that the move risks undermining Canada’s climate commitments, industry leaders argue it preserves jobs and stabilizes the auto sector during a period of global uncertainty [9]. For investors, the key lies in hedging against volatility by diversifying portfolios across EV-related infrastructure, renewable energy, and alternative decarbonization technologies.

The coming months will be critical. The 60-day review of the EVAS, set to conclude by October 2025, could yield adjustments that reconcile industry needs with climate goals. In the interim, investors must navigate a landscape where policy uncertainty coexists with long-term opportunities in clean energy. As one analyst noted, “The pause isn’t a pivot—it’s a recalibration. The direction remains clear; the pace may shift” [10].",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 20:01:04.514454

Nio (NYSE:NIO) Stock

Chinese EV maker NIO recently reported mixed results for Q2 2025. The company missed sales estimates, as robust growth in deliveries, driven by models like the ONVO L90, was offset by the impact of price wars amid intense competition in the Chinese EV market.

Nonetheless, improved deliveries and optimism about the demand for the ES8 model have moved NIO ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) higher by 32% over the past month and more than 36% year-to-date.

Looking ahead, Nio expects Q3 vehicle deliveries in the range of 87,000 to 91,000 units, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 40.7% to 47.1%. It is worth noting that Nio’s August deliveries jumped 55% to 31,305 units, including 10,575 units of the ONVO L90, the flagship SUV of its mass-market brand.

Is NIO a Good Stock to Buy?

Reacting to the Q2 print, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh raised the price target for NIO stock to $6 from $3.50, while reiterating a Hold rating. The 5-star analyst noted that Nio’s Q2 revenue and earnings were “modestly softer” compared to the consensus estimates. Rakesh added that Nio’s Q3 deliveries guidance of 89,000 units (at the midpoint), which missed the consensus of 91,100 units, indicates 47% sequential growth and a new lower average selling price (ASP) related to the Firefly/ONVO L90 ramps.

While better near-term EV demand for lower ASP models is helping, Rakesh argues that the expectation for exiting Q4 2025 at about 50,000 deliveries per month seems challenging. Overall, Rakesh believes that NIO is fairly valued at a price-to-sales (2026) multiple of 0.8x, as near-term revenue and delivery tailwinds are offset by margin challenges as models ramp.

Currently, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Nio stock based on six Buys, five Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average NIO stock price target of $5.95 indicates that the stock is fully valued at current levels.

XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) Stock

Let’s look at another Chinese EV maker, XPeng, which has seen its stock rally about 68% year-to-date. XPeng impressed investors with a 125% year-over-year jump in its Q2 revenue. Moreover, the company reported a 63% year-over-year reduction in its second-quarter net loss attributable to shareholders, thanks to robust deliveries and improved margins.

XPeng is benefiting from continued demand for the Mona M03 and P7+ sedans, the updated versions of the G6, G9, and X9 models, and the launch of the new G7 SUV.

Looking ahead, XPeng is confident about continued growth, backed by its focus on innovation and overseas expansion. In the first half of the year, XPEV’s overseas deliveries surpassed 18,000 units, increasing more than 200% year-over-year.

Is XPEV a Good Stock to Buy?

Recently, Jefferies analyst Alexious Lee reiterated a Buy rating on XPeng stock with a price target of $29. The 4-star analyst hosted a post-result non-deal roadshow (NDR) for XPeng in Hong Kong. Lee noted that XPeng’s first-half results beat expectations, thanks to solid margins from economies of scale.

Lee sees a clear path to profitability by the fourth quarter of this year, with the G7 and new P7 models set to start mass deliveries. Lee stated that he views XPeng’s “tech DNA as the most differentiated moat,” which is combining rapid product innovation, AI leadership, and global expansion to bolster its place as a top-tier EV maker. Further, Lee believes that the CEO’s share buyback reflects confidence in XPeng’s trajectory.

Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on XPeng stock based on nine Buys, two Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average XPEV stock price target of $25.75 indicates about 30% upside potential.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Stock

Tesla stock has been under pressure this year due to concerns about weak deliveries, CEO Elon Musk’s political distractions, and a lack of innovation. The stock is down 13% year-to-date and has underperformed the broader market.

However, TSLA stock has recovered 14% over the past month due to optimism about the company’s full self-driving (FSD) technology, the continued rollout of its robotaxi service, and prospects for Optimus, its humanoid robot.

Moreover, investors cheered the decision of Tesla’s board to approve a $1 trillion pay package for CEO Musk, contingent upon his achieving certain milestones.

Is TSLA Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

Reacting to the board’s proposed pay package for Musk, Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro called the milestones “very aggressive.” The 4-star analyst added that achieving these targets would “clearly require sustained executional excellence” and strong growth in auto deliveries, FSD success, robotaxi traction, and robust success of the Optimus humanoid robot.

Gengaro stated that the unprecedented pay package clearly incentivizes Musk to lead Tesla for the long term. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $440.

Overall, Tesla scores a Hold consensus rating based on 14 Buys, 14 Holds, and eight Sell recommendations. The average TSLA stock price target of $309 indicates about 12% downside risk from current levels.

Conclusion

Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about Nio and XPeng stocks, but sidelined on Tesla. Analysts see higher upside potential in XPEV stock than in the other two EV stocks. XPeng’s robust deliveries in recent quarters, despite intense competition in the Chinese EV market, solid execution, and improving margins support analysts’ bullish stance.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2314812733-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 20:00:53.548918

City Council members approved a $4 million loan agreement with the Texas Water Development Board during their Aug. 26 meeting. The funds will go toward a water treatment project to remove per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, that are commonly known as “forever chemicals,” from fluid coming from the city’s southeast landfill before being treated.

The chemicals have been found in leachate, the fluid that drains from landfills or through waste, that then flows into the city’s wastewater collection system and is treated at the Village Creek Water Reclamation Facility, city spokesperson Mary Gugliuzza said in a statement.

The southeast landfill receives residential, commercial and industrial waste.

Because of the amount of PFAS collected over the last 50 years in solid waste streams, leachate often contains high concentrations of the chemicals, Gugliuzza said.

PFAS are made up of manufactured chemicals that break down very slowly and can build up in humans, animals and in the environment over time, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Forever chemicals can be found in sources of drinking water systems, landfill and disposal sites, fire extinguishing foam, food packaging, household cleaning products, biosolids and manufacturing or chemical production plants.

Exposure to the chemicals can lead to decreased fertility, developmental effects in children, increased risk of some cancers, a weakened immune system and increased cholesterol levels, according to the EPA.

The project comes in response to the city’s requirements on industrial waste pretreatment, Gugliuzza added, which limits the amount of forever chemicals that go through wastewater treatment.

The city will not have to repay the loan as long as it meets contractual requirements, according to city documents.

Fort Worth leaders have taken up other water quality treatment projects recently to address PFAS in local water supplies.

In March, city officials joined a lawsuit alleging the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth and chemical manufacturers contaminated Fort Worth’s water supply by using products containing forever chemicals, including fire-fighting foam.

The city sought $420 million in reimbursement for treating the water. The lawsuit, originally filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, was dismissed by Fort Worth officials.

They later joined a federal lawsuit filed out of South Carolina along with other plaintiffs against the original 12 defendants. City officials could not provide an update on the case.

Water treatment plant to supply additional millions of gallons of water

Council members also approved a contract with the state water board to fund the $180 million expansion of the Eagle Mountain Water Treatment Plant.

The plant will be able to treat an additional 35 million gallons a day after the expansion, up from the 105 million gallons a day it currently produces.

The funds, made available through the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas, offers local governments financial assistance to fund projects related to conservation and reuse, water treatment plants, reservoirs and pipelines.

The expansion project comes in response to rapid development and population growth.

Fort Worth has 1 million residents. Officials expect to add 550,000 more residents by 2045 throughout the city’s service areas, water utility director Chris Harder said in a Feb. 18 meeting.

The water department ultimately plans on expanding the Eagle Mountain plant to produce up to 200 million gallons a day, Harder said. The total expansion is projected to cost up to $250 million.

However, as gas prices fluctuate wildly, many Americans may reconsider the cars they drive and how much they drive.","Gas can get real expensive, real fast

Unless you are a proud owner of an electric car, you know that paying for gas is an expense that cannot be ignored for the life of you. It’s one of those routine costs that sneaks up on your budget every week, and depending on where you live, it can take a much bigger bite out of your paycheck than you might expect. Gas prices vary wildly across the country, but the real story isn’t just about what’s posted on the pump; it’s about how much of your paycheck is swallowed up at the gas pump.

For some drivers, it’s a manageable hit and just another part of the weekly grind. For others, it can be a heart-wrenching expense that creates a significant hole in their online banking statements. A new study looking at both pump prices and local incomes paints a clearer picture of which states’ drivers are sacrificing the most just to keep moving.

The brains at FinanceBuzz used data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Census Bureau, and other sources like AAA to calculate and compile the U.S. states where the average driver spends the most of their monthly income on gas.

They found that drivers' gas spending and financial impact can vary significantly based on various factors like the median income in different states, the average number of miles they drive, and local gas prices. After analyzing all the data, it was determined that, on average, Americans spend 2.28% of their income on gas nationwide. However, in some states, this expenditure can be as high as 3.73%, while in others, it can drop as low as 0.76%.

Drivers in the South have it the worst at the pump

FinanceBuzz analyzed states where drivers need to budget heavily for gas, revealing that in many of these states, apart from Montana and Florida, drivers clock in over 1,000 miles per month on average. These states are often large and rural, resulting in long daily drives that can lead to higher fuel costs than their residents can afford.

Mississippi and Arkansas have the lowest median incomes, with the average driver taking home less than $50,000 a year, and New Mexico and Louisiana are close behind. Despite states like Mississippi having some of the lowest gas prices nationally, drivers in these states spend a larger chunk of their income on gas, due to the combination of low earnings and high monthly mileage.

Drivers in D.C. and on the Coasts have it the best at the pump

Unlike the states where drivers spend a large portion of their income on gas, the states where people spend a much smaller percentage of their take-home pay tend to be smaller, more urbanized areas with higher median incomes.

Drivers in Washington, D.C. may spend the smallest percentage of their incomes on gas, but FinanceBuzz notes that drivers there clock in an average of just 440 miles per month, the lowest in the country. Though it’s technically not a state, our nation’s capital is a city with a well-developed public transportation system that enables people to get around without much driving. At the same time, drivers in New York and Rhode Island drive fewer than 600 miles per month on average, largely due to the New York Metro Area’s robust transit systems and Rhode Island being the smallest U.S. state by total land area.

In addition, drivers in states on this list tend to have higher average incomes. The median income in Washington, D.C., is the highest in the country, topping $100,000, while median earnings in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland rank among the highest in the country.

Final thoughts

Ultimately, the link between gas prices, income, and the cars Americans drive underscores the complexity of decisions influenced by economic circumstances. Beyond our cities, the United States is a landscape where gas prices play a pivotal role in shaping the choices of a diverse range of car owners. The connection between income levels and gas prices can significantly impact what people drive and how much gas they use. However, as gas prices fluctuate wildly, many Americans may reconsider the cars they drive and how much they drive.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/ec6b54898649cb72ac9af060130ea595,N,,2025-09-06 19:06:42.737518

Gavin Newsom, whose administration signaled strong opposition to advancing E15 ahead of a California Air Resources Board regulatory review.

In testimony at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing last month on Assembly Bill 30, California Department of Finance officials labeled the bill as duplicative and unnecessary. A budget official pointed to the $2.3 million and 10 positions the Legislature approved this year for CARB to implement the new E15 standards, resources that will not be available until the agency completes its review.

The administration’s opposition to AB 30 centers on new costs to the California Department of Food and Agriculture for enforcing petroleum product quality standards. CDFA would need new equipment to sample and test E15, along with other expenses for maintenance and supplies. To cover those costs, the department would have to raise its motor vehicle fee beyond the current five cents per gallon. Increasing fuel fees would run counter to the administration's priority to lower gas prices.

Finance staff underscored that CARB’s review is the proper venue to determine how E15 fits within those standards.

Newsom has until Oct. 12 to decide.

Legislative Push for Lower Prices

Despite the administration’s stance, lawmakers moved the bill with rare bipartisan unity. The Assembly passed AB 30 in June without opposition, and the Senate followed with a 39-0 vote this week. With its urgency statute, the bill would take effect immediately upon the governor’s signature.

Backers have highlighted the potential for cost savings as Californians continue to pay some of the nation’s highest gas prices. A University of California, Berkeley and U.S. Naval Academy study estimated drivers could save about 20 cents per gallon, or $2.7 billion statewide, if E15 were widely available.

“California consumers cannot wait any longer,” said California Sen. Laura Richardson, D-South Bay, during the floor debate.

The bill’s author, Assemblymember David Alvarez, D-San Diego, argued it is past time for the state to join the other 49 states that already allow the blend.

Industry groups representing ethanol producers and corn growers have echoed those arguments, citing both economic and environmental benefits. Studies by CARB and UC Riverside have suggested E15 could cut tailpipe pollutants that contribute to smog and health risks.

Fuel Industry Urges Signature

The Renewable Fuels Association pressed Newsom to sign quickly.

“Many other states have already seen the benefits of E15 — healthier air, better engine performance and cost savings at the pump,” said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper. “Now California drivers are on the cusp of experiencing those same advantages.”

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor pointed out that E15 is already approved for use in 96% of all light-duty vehicles on the road.

“Growth Energy has already begun to provide technical expertise in support of CARB’s still-forthcoming E15 approval rulemaking, and we encourage the state to identify other ways to maximize the impact AB 30 can have in the short-term,” said Skor. “With AB 30, the Legislature heard and responded to California drivers that demanded more affordable fuel options.”

In addition to national trade groups, California-based stakeholders have lined up behind the bill. The California Farm Bureau has endorsed AB 30, citing potential relief for rural communities facing high fuel costs. The California Fuels and Convenience Alliance, which represents the state’s retailers, has also backed the measure.

What’s Next

Newsom now faces a decision that could anger Democrats and biofuel producers alike if he issues a veto. His administration has leaned on fiscal concerns, warning that authorizing E15 before CARB’s process concludes would raise state spending — as it continues to grapple with an ongoing budget deficit — while undermining regulatory integrity.

In a special session last year, lawmakers shot down a bill to accelerate E15. Matthew Botill, a division chief at CARB, explained to the lawmakers that the agency must evaluate the potential air, water and soil impacts. That has led to several studies and literature assessments, followed by a review from an environmental policy committee, extending the process. Once that is completed, CARB can consider reopening the rulemaking, triggering several more months of hearings and administrative review.

“It's a resource-intensive process,” said Botill. “It does take time and staff on the CARB side.”

Two weeks after the bill stalled, Newsom directed CARB to accelerate its review regardless of the legislation. A month later, Alvarez echoed that message with AB 30.

Newsom's office declined Friday to comment on his plans for the bill.",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/QI8cdkoufBfmwkc6h6GViAr8dC0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Ethanol20from20flickr-2000-0a0d81f6221043f98e22ca5a38613e31.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 19:02:44.074432

International markets are gaining significant ground due to more attractive valuations, favorable monetary policy, and a different mix of companies.
While the U.S. equities markets will remain the gold standard, there are definitive signs that global dynamics are shifting.","For much of the past decade, the U.S. stock market has dramatically outperformed its global counterparts. A major reason is the emergence and dominance of the U.S. technology sector and the rapid expansion of “mega-cap” companies such as Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia. However, there are signs that international equities may be making a comeback.

Thus far this year, international stocks are enjoying higher returns than those of U.S. firms by some measures. This phenomenon has not been limited to a single region, as numerous markets have shown impressive gains. Historically, the performance leader has swung from the U.S. to the rest of the world and back multiple times, and several key factors are contributing to this current shift.

One reason is the high values of U.S. stocks, particularly in the technology sector, which have been trading at a significant premium compared to international equities. Price-to-earnings ratios for U.S. stocks have been higher for quite a while. In fact, the valuation gap is the widest that it has been in decades. As a result, other major markets are becoming a more attractive proposition for value-seeking investors.

In addition, many countries began easing up on monetary policy before the United States. The Federal Reserve has not yet reduced interest rates this year (following three moves in 2024), while central banks elsewhere (particularly in Europe) have implemented cuts. Much of this pattern stems from the potential inflationary effects of tariffs and the resilience of domestic growth. Nonetheless, this approach has put U.S. economic prospects and corporate earnings at a comparative disadvantage.

Another factor is that, while U.S. market strength has been highly concentrated in relatively few technology-oriented stocks, other sectors, such as financials and industrials, are now showing some momentum. These segments are more heavily represented in international markets, thus enhancing the attractiveness of global investments.

Despite the performance of international stocks, investors have been slow to shift until recently. There is growing acknowledgment of the risks associated with concentration in the U.S. market due to high valuations and the importance of a small number of firms to overall returns. Additionally, U.S. firms are affected by various domestic policy issues which have brought unprecedented uncertainty and notable volatility of late (though many nations face significant challenges).

International markets are gaining significant ground due to more attractive valuations, favorable monetary policy, and a different mix of companies. The underlying driver of stock markets is expected firm profitability which is in turn dependent on economic conditions and innovation. While the U.S. equities markets will remain the gold standard, there are definitive signs that global dynamics are shifting. The coming months should be quite interesting to watch.

(CNN) — The Environmental Protection Agency has moved to suspend more than 100 staffers who signed a letter of dissent against the Trump administration’s policies in July, a representative of the union covering the agency’s staff told CNN on Friday.

The EPA previously moved to fire a handful of employees late last week, but now it is taking disciplinary action against more than 130 employees also suspected of signing the letter, the representative said. These employees were sent letters indicating they would be suspended for 14 days without pay.

The reason cited in the letters is for “conduct unbecoming of a federal employee,” the representative said, noting that is highly unusual, if not unprecedented, under the circumstances.

An EPA spokesperson would not confirm the report or details, saying the agency “does not comment on individual personnel matters.”

“These workers bravely voiced concerns about harmful changes at the Agency that threaten the lives of every American. And we know the administration’s motives are not about government efficiency or advancing public safety. Placing these workers on leave and now firing or suspending them months later has wasted over 47,000 work hours and $2 million. This is simply about squashing dissent and preventing workers from protecting American lives,” said Justin Chen, president of the union group AFGE Council 238, in a statement Friday.

The EPA placed roughly 140 employees on administrative leave in July, days after they signed a public letter expressing concern about the treatment of federal employees and the Trump administration’s regulations on climate and public health. In the letter, employees criticized the EPA, saying it has strayed from its core mission to protect human health and the environment.

The EPA conducted an “administrative investigation” into the employees, who were placed on administrative leave until July 17, according to internal emails viewed by CNN at the time. Some employees were let go last week, but additional staff members were affected on Thursday.

On Friday, the agency’s spokesperson also repeated its previous statement on the matter, saying the EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage, and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November. Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”",https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 18:02:59.764527

That is why the Central Asian nation – already producing rare metals worth over $252.7 million annually – is investing in advanced mining technologies, infrastructure enhancements, and diverse international partnerships.","Amid the global hunt for natural resources, Kazakhstan aims to position itself as a reliable supplier of critical minerals. Although the energy-rich Central Asian nation is expected to soon become the third-largest holder of rare earth reserves in the world, Astana is signaling that it wants to be more than just a raw material supplier.

Kazakhstan’s decades-old cooperation with major international energy giants has shaped the country’s overall economic growth. The nation’s GDP per capita ($14,770, by far the highest in Central Asia) is expected to surpass Russia’s $14,260 and China’s $13,690. But from the Kazakh perspective, things could be even better. Astana now seeks to revise its contracts with Western oil corporations, particularly when it comes to oil exploitation.

According to reports, 98% of the revenue generated from Kashagan – a massive offshore oil field in the Caspian Sea and Kazakhstan’s most valuable find in the last five decades – is being funneled into the profits of Shell (UK), Eni (Italy) and Total Energies (France). It is, therefore, no surprise that the Central Asian nation aims to secure a more favorable stance in these arrangements.

Another challenge for Kazakhstan is the very structure of its export portfolio. Presently, Europe primarily imports oil from Kazakhstan, with 80% of it passing through Russia. Astana is actively working to diversify its exports and boost crude oil shipments via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.

Simultaneously, Astana is expected to continue working toward another ambitious goal: generating 15% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 50 percent by 2050. It is part of the nation’s strategy to become a significant exporter of green electricity to Europe.

In parallel, Kazakhstan plans to attract new investors to its energy sector. It seeks to develop nuclear cooperation with Japan, while also eying to establish joint gas projects with Indonesia. Moreover, by the end of 2026 Kazakhstan and Jordan are expected to begin developing uranium deposits in the Middle Eastern country. If the results prove economically viable, a joint enterprise will be launched, and Kazakhstan’s Kazatomprom will hold a 70% stake, while the Jordanian National Uranium Company (Jumco) will retain 30%.

This move suggests that Astana is not only focused on tapping into its own natural resources, but is also looking to expand its energy interests beyond its borders. It is no secret that Kazakhstan – despite being the world’s largest producer of uranium – is interested in the extraction and processing of uranium and rare-earth metals in Tajikistan, a landlocked Central Asian nation that appears keen to strengthen its ties with its neighbor, the region’s largest economy.

Indeed, an increasing number of countries are eager to do business with Kazakhstan and establish closer economic and political ties with the energy-rich state. Fully aware of this, Kazakh policy makers decided to invite experts from various nations to discuss geopolitical, economic and strategic issues at upcoming the Astana Think Tank Forum. The event will take place on October 15-16, providing a platform for honest, constructive policy dialogue in a polarized world.

Over the years, Kazakhstan has been pursuing a balanced multilateral approach in the international arena, balancing relations with all major actors in Central Asia: Russia, China, the United States, and the European Union. The fact that Russia’s Rosatom and the China National Nuclear Corporation are set to build nuclear power plants in the largest regional nation, clearly indicates that Astana intends to extend its “multi-vector” approach to the energy sector as well.

In an attempt to diversify its export portfolio, Kazakhstan is actively cooperating with China in the development of its energy and mining sectors. At the same time, it seeks to strengthen ties with the U.S.-based investment firm Cove Capital, a company interested in conducting geological explorations in the former Soviet republic.

Reports suggest that in the first three months of the year, authorities in Kazakhstan identified 38 new mineral deposits, including gold, rare earth metals, copper, nickel, and brown coal. As Jozef Síkela, the European Commissioner for International Partnerships, stressed in March, the access to critical raw materials is essential for the EU to modernize its economy.

Kazakhstan, on the other hand, intends to modernize its existing production facilities and infrastructure, expand geological exploration, introduce modern processing technologies, and strengthen the research base. To achieve that goal, Astana plans to bring international partners into exploration and processing projects, aiming to gain access to advanced technology, state-of-the-art equipment, and lucrative markets.

The country holds significant reserves of critical minerals, including zinc, copper, lead, and nickel. However, despite the growing global demand for these resources, the ease and cost of mining will vary depending on factors such as depth, grade, water availability, and accessibility. Kazakhstan knows its mineral wealth has huge potential to help accelerate the world’s energy transition, and yield tangible benefits for its people. That is why the Central Asian nation – already producing rare metals worth over $252.7 million annually – is investing in advanced mining technologies, infrastructure enhancements, and diverse international partnerships.

Energy Equity: A Balancing Act For investors, the challenge lies in balancing the immediate risks of rising utility costs with the long-term potential of green energy.
Conclusion: Strategic Opportunities in a Shifting Energy Landscape Missouri's utility sector is a microcosm of the broader energy transition.","Missouri's energy landscape is undergoing a pivotal shift as Spire Missouri's recent gas rate hike—approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission (PSC)—takes effect on October 24, 2025. The 10% to 10.5% increase in natural gas rates will add approximately $8.21 to $8.93 per month to the average residential bill, depending on the region. While the hike is framed as necessary to fund infrastructure upgrades, it raises critical questions about affordability for households and the broader implications for energy equity. At the same time, the regulatory environment and infrastructure investments are creating fertile ground for energy infrastructure and green utility stocks to thrive.

The Financial Impact on Missouri Households

Spire's rate increase, though reduced from its original $289.5 million request to $210 million, still represents a significant burden for consumers. For eastern Missouri households, the $8.21 monthly increase may seem modest in isolation but compounds over time. For a family earning below the median income of $65,000 annually, this hike could consume 1.5% of their monthly budget—a non-trivial share when combined with inflationary pressures on other essentials. Western Missouri residents face a slightly higher 10.5% increase, reflecting regional infrastructure disparities.

However, the PSC's approval included safeguards. The rate hike is partially offset by a 40% drop in natural gas prices since 2024, ensuring that 2025 bills will still be lower than in the previous year. Additionally, Spire's low-income programs, such as the Limited Income Customer Charge Pilot Program—which waives a $22 monthly fee for qualifying households—provide critical relief. These measures highlight the tension between utility profitability and consumer affordability, a theme that will define energy policy debates in the coming years.

Regulatory Shifts and Infrastructure Investments: A Tailwind for Energy Stocks

The rate hike is part of a broader trend of regulatory alignment with infrastructure modernization. Missouri utilities are increasingly prioritizing grid resilience and renewable integration, driven by both necessity and policy incentives. Ameren Missouri (AEE), for instance, is capitalizing on this momentum with its $28 billion five-year plan. The company's Reform Renewable Energy Center—a 250-MW solar project adjacent to its nuclear-powered Callaway Energy Center—exemplifies the hybrid approach to energy generation. By pairing solar with battery storage and natural gas backup, Ameren is positioning itself to meet reliability demands while reducing carbon intensity.

Ameren's strategic alignment with regulatory goals—such as its net-zero-by-2045 target—has already translated into strong investor confidence. Its disciplined execution and regulatory approvals in Missouri and Illinois have enabled stable returns, making it a standout in the utility sector. Similarly, Evergy (EVE), another Missouri-based utility, is expanding its natural gas and solar capacity under a $2.75 billion infrastructure plan. While environmental groups have criticized its reliance on gas, the company's ability to secure federal tax credits for solar projects underscores the financial incentives driving this transition.

National Green Utility Stocks: Riding the Renewable Wave

Beyond Missouri, national green utility stocks are poised to benefit from the same forces. NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE), the world's largest wind and solar generator, is a prime example. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has supercharged its growth, with agreements to develop 10.5 gigawatts of renewables and storage by 2030. NextEra's transmission projects in AI-driven data center hubs like the PJM Interconnection further position it to capitalize on surging electricity demand.

Brookfield Renewable Partners LP (BEP) is another key player, leveraging its global hydroelectric and solar assets to meet corporate clean energy demands. Its recent partnership with Cameco to acquire Westinghouse—a nuclear services giant—signals a strategic pivot toward diversified energy solutions. Meanwhile, GE Vernova (GEV), spun off from General Electric, is gaining traction with its focus on offshore wind and grid modernization, supported by IRA tax credits.

Energy Equity: A Balancing Act

For investors, the challenge lies in balancing the immediate risks of rising utility costs with the long-term potential of green energy. Spire's rate hike and Missouri's regulatory environment highlight the need for utilities to invest in infrastructure while maintaining affordability. Companies that successfully navigate this balance—like Ameren and NextEra—offer a compelling mix of stable dividends and growth potential.

However, energy equity remains a critical concern. Low-income households, which already spend 3.5 times more of their income on energy than higher-income households, are disproportionately affected by rate hikes. Investors should consider utilities that integrate social responsibility into their strategies, such as Spire's pilot programs or Ameren's community-focused solar initiatives.

Conclusion: Strategic Opportunities in a Shifting Energy Landscape

Missouri's utility sector is a microcosm of the broader energy transition. While rising gas rates test consumer resilience, they also catalyze investments in infrastructure and renewables. For equity investors, the path forward lies in supporting companies that align with both regulatory trends and societal needs. Ameren, NextEra, and Brookfield represent not just financial opportunities but also models for sustainable energy equity in an era of rising costs and climate urgency.

As the October 24 rate hike looms, the interplay between affordability, infrastructure, and innovation will define Missouri's energy future—and the stocks that lead the charge.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 18:03:13.591064

Ultimately, the US has shifted its policy away from green technology acceleration to a more guarded strategy focused on domestic energy security, creating a more complex and uncertain environment for the future of the energy transition.
By Rystad Energy More Top Reads From Oilprice.com Canada Rethinks EV Targets to Aid Carmakers Oil Slips 2% as Saudi Arabia Presses OPEC+ to Fast-Track Output Hike SCO Unity Crumbles Amidst Internal Conflicts","US President Donald Trump significantly pivoted US energy policy with the signing of The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), transforming supply chains, redirecting investment flows and solidifying the US government’s support of traditional fuels. The act, which underscored the administration’s domestic energy dominance ambitions, was packed with various cost-cutting measures that directly reversed key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Rystad Energy estimates that the OBBBA’s aggressive foreign content tests, and restrictions on Specified Foreign Entities (SPEs), may force companies to build more resilient, but potentially more expensive, supply chains, independent of target nations. Specific provisions, like the North American feedstock requirement for biofuels, will likely directly reshape global trade flows, creating clear-cut winners and losers in international commodity markets.

Compared to the IRA’s original timeline, the OBBBA shortens the runway for projects in several key sectors, accelerating the termination of tax credits for wind, solar and clean hydrogen. In a clear policy choice, biofuels received a favorable multi-year extension of credits, while consumer-facing credits for electric vehicles (EVs) and residential solar are eliminated.

One of the law’s most significant revisions is the shortened timeline for Clean Electricity Production and Investment Tax Credits, known as the 45Y and 48E credits. Now, solar and wind projects must begin construction within the next 12 months and be placed in service by end of 2027, rather than after 2032. Rystad Energy expects developers to rush orders for project materials to comply with the new one-year period set by the OBBBA to safe-harbor incentives for projects to be placed in service by 2029-2030.

The OBBBA also?introduces stringent changes for clean energy manufacturing and supply chains, with the most critical changes in the introduction of new restrictions on foreign content. To qualify for the remaining tax credits, project components must meet domestic or ‘friend-shored’ sourcing thresholds that escalate over time, topping out as high as 90% for some equipment. From a solar developer’s perspective, meeting the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements will be a costly and arduous process.

US shale companies with the most exposure to federal land with mineral rights stand to benefit from the royalty rate cut and tax incentives ushered in through the OBBBA. Although the legislation may not spur a new era of high growth from US shale oil plays, marginal benefits can be realized through continued near-term investments and improved economics that will favor companies with the most exposure to federal lands. In the long term, reduced federal royalty rates could help lower the marginal supply cost needed for new incremental sources of gas. Additionally, Rystad Energy finds that the reinstatement of the 100% bonus depreciation for tangible capital expenditure could lower breakeven prices by one to two dollars per barrel for short-term development in most core unconventional US oil plays, assuming consistent recurring investment. This benefit will apply to all companies, regardless of federal lands exposure.

The impact of the OBBBA, much like the IRA, will resonate globally, calibrating the competitive landscape for clean tech investment. Ultimately, the US has shifted its policy away from green technology acceleration to a more guarded strategy focused on domestic energy security, creating a more complex and uncertain environment for the future of the energy transition.

It's a shame that we let it go to waste day after day after day after day.","McKibben is not a common name in my experience, but it is at times an influential name. On more than one occasion at a Marriot Hotel, we were treated like royalty when announcing our name while checking in. Some Marriot properties are managed by McKibbon Hospitality, that had its beginnings in 1926 by the McKibbon brothers in Gainesville, Georgia, with a small Piggly Wiggly franchise.

I’ve seen portraits of Jack McKibbon adorning the registration desk area of a few hotels and even when we have protested that our name is spelled differently, insisting that we are not related, we were treated as if we were. Which in all fairness, is a goal of the McKibbon Hospitality management team.

When we visited Walden Pond, just after we were coming out of the pandemic lockdown, we were invited by the ranger to watch a brief film, “Henry David Thoreau, Surveyor of the Soul,” before heading down to the pond. She was cautious, as she should have been, about shaking Bruce’s outheld hand, keeping her own hands firmly tucked in.

The beautiful film closed with remarks from Bill McKibben, known as the first environmentalist to sound the alarm about global warming with his groundbreaking book, “The End of Nature,” published in 1989. As we exited the theater, Bruce told the ranger that we were in town for the McKibben Family reunion and she eagerly grabbed his hand that she had shunned earlier, in awe that we were McKibbens.

I would love to be related to Bill McKibben. Educated at Harvard University, he is the Schumann Distinguished Scholar in Environmental Studies at Middlebury College, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the 2013 winner of the Gandhi Prize and the same year the Thomas Merton Prize, and holds honorary degrees from 18 colleges and universities.

In addition to writing 21 significant books on climate and justice, “he is a founder of 350.org, the first planet-wide, grassroots climate change movement, which has organized twenty thousand rallies around the world in every country save North Korea, spearheaded the resistance to the Keystone Pipeline, and launched the fast-growing fossil fuel divestment movement.”

Turning point with climate

He also is a co-founder of Third Act, which mobilizes people over age 60 for action on climate and justice, including Third Act Florida in our state: thirdact.org.

On Aug. 19, 2025, Bill McKibben launched his most recent book, “Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization.” What is most remarkable to many, including Bill McKibben himself, is that just when it seems the news could not be worse about the condition of the planet, renewable energy has crossed a crucial threshold of being both affordable and accessible.

“Sometime in the course of this decade, we passed some invisible line where it became cheaper to produce energy from the sun and the wind than from burning coal and gas and oil,” McKibben writes. He believes that if we act now, we will be able to put the brakes on climate devastation and solve problems related to our earth and our humanity that desperately need addressing.

As someone who has for most of his career been the bearer of bad news regarding climate, the “doomsday prophet” as he has been called and calls himself, what a delight to him and to us to realize that there is legitimate hope for our planet if we act now.

Another 'Sun Day' on Sept. 21

On the first “Sun Day,” on May 3, 1978, President Jimmy Carter visited the Solar Energy Research Institute that his administration had founded in 1977, three years after Congress and the Nixon White House had taken steps to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.

Carter said, “We must begin the long, slow job of winning back our economic independence. Nobody can embargo sunlight. No cartel controls the sun. Its energy will not run out. It will not pollute the air; it will not poison our waters. It's free from stench and smog. The sun's power needs only to be collected, stored, and used.”

McKibben laments that we did not find the will to move on this opportunity 48 years ago, but is so thrilled that we have another chance today if we only take it.

This year’s Sun Day is scheduled for Sept. 21, and the hope is to organize a powerful climate movement to take advantage of this remarkable opportunity affordable solar power is presenting to us. The Sun Day website found at sunday.earth is easy to use and offers helpful ideas about how to plan and register an event, whether large or small, to take action, how to find an event to join, and how to celebrate the power of clean energy.

Harnessing solar

There is a playlist on Spotify of sun songs, a sun drawing collection from people around the world who have drawn the Sun Day logo, to which you can add your own drawing, and suggested postcards you create to send to lawmakers. And above all, we can read and share McKibben’s remarkable book, with astonishing information about the ways in which we are on the road to restoring some of what we have lost.

Solar is no longer alternative energy, as it is growing faster than any energy source in history. And the key now, he says, is to propel the rising solar power movement forward despite massive resistance from the fossil-fuel industry and its political enablers.

A theologian I admire, Diana Butler Bass, praises his book not only for the remarkable information contained within it, but “the sheer beauty of its prose.” It has important dimensions of scientific information and moral imperative that invite the reader to hope and to action.

McKibben is not a preacher, though he has taught Sunday School and led worship at his small Vermont Methodist Church.

He does say in gratitude, “The good Lord was kind enough to hang this big ball of burning gas 93 million miles up in the sky. And he's given us the wit to learn how to make full use of it. It's a shame that we let it go to waste day after day after day after day. The sun already gives us light; it already gives us warmth. It already allows us to have photosynthesis, and now it's willing to give us all the power we could ever want. I think we should thank God for that.”

It is my prayer that we will thank God and find the will to take advantage of this remarkable gift that is ours if we act now. Would you join thousands of others across the globe who see this as a decisive moment?

Sept. 7 is Grandparents Day. Perhaps those of us who are grandparents will get involved for the sake of those children we adore. Or the one death in five globally that could be saved annually without breathing combustion byproducts of fossil fuel. Or to seize the single greatest possibility for rapid development and poverty alleviation that we've ever seen in renewable energy. Together we can do this. How exciting!

Why are electric bills in Indiana higher this summer?

Electric bills in Indiana, including Monroe County, are higher this summer than a year ago because of higher electricity rates and above-normal temperatures.

State regulators early this year approved a request by Duke Energy to be allowed to raise its electric rates.

A spokeswoman for the utility said the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission allowed Duke Energy to raise its rates by about 9% in February, which is contributing to rates this summer being higher than a year ago. Rates will increase another roughly 4% early next year.

However, Duke’s Lead Communications Manager McKenzie Barbknecht said higher temperatures this summer also have contributed.

Average temperatures in Bloomington this summer:

June: 75.6 degrees, or 3.6 degrees above normal, Barbknecht said via email.

July: 79.3 degrees, or 4.6 degrees above normal.

August, as of the middle of the month: 76.4 degrees, or 2.4 degrees above normal.

What does Duke Energy plan to do with the additional revenue?

The utility said in a news release early this year that it asked state regulators to be allowed to hike rakes “to continue making investments in a modernized electric grid that is more resistant to power outages, increasing reliability at our power plants, constructing hundreds of miles of new power lines, complying with evolving environmental responsibilities and improving electric grid security.”

The utility said that among other things, it has been installing:

Sensors on power lines that can detect problems automatically and would reroute power, much like a GPS system in a car reroutes a driver.

Underground power lines and steel poles to replace wood poles to harden its system against severe weather.

How can you lower your electric bill?

Duke and the U.S. Department of Energy said you can reduce your electricity usage by:

Raising your thermostat.

Using cool water to wash clothes.

Running heat-producing appliances in the morning when it’s cooler.

Closing curtains on the sunny side of your home.

Operating ceiling fans (counterclockwise).

Buying energy-efficient appliances, electronics and lights.

Reducing “always-on” appliances. Look for electronics that you don’t use or can switch off — or perhaps get rid of that extra refrigerator.

Are we done for the year with high temps? What's the forecast?

While many Hoosiers have gotten a nice break from summer heat in the past few days, with highs in the low- to mid-70s, the mercury is expected to rise again in Bloomington, with highs in the mid-80s in mid-September, according to The Weather Channel — though lows will remain in the mid- to high 50s.

Source: DOT, IRS EV STATS IN HAWAII >> Hawaii has 38,086 registered passengers EVs.","For electric vehicle drivers in Hawaii, there will soon be few, if any, perks left — as some of the most popular ones are set to expire this month.

Solo drivers with EV license plates have since 2012 been permitted to use the high-occupancy vehicle lane on Oahu highways, which are usually reserved for cars with at least two occupants during rush hour to encourage carpooling.

On Sept. 30, a federal code allowing states to set their own HOV lane requirements expires, and federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of EV vehicles also end.

These changes come at a time when Hawaii is being held accountable for its ambitious, state-mandated goals of achieving 100% clean energy and net-zero emissions by 2045, and are expected to hamper efforts to get more residents to drive electric in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“It definitely doesn’t help,” said state Rep. Nicole Lowen, chair of the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee. “Taking incentives away isn’t pushing things in the right direction.”

Still, she thinks most of the impetus behind EV adoption has been market­ driven.

The HOV lane perk may have been an incentive for some drivers commuting on the H-1 freeway to go electric, but even without it, EVs remain a competitive choice for consumers, she said, because they cost less to own and operate in the long run.

There are fewer maintenance costs, such as a regular oil changes, and no more waiting in line at the gas station.

“From a consumer point of view, there’s still a really strong case for it,” she said. “I think we’ll continue to see people buying EVs.”

History of perks

In an effort to boost the adoption of EVs, Hawaii passed a law in 2012 that offered a smorgasbord of perks.

EVs were not only allowed to use the HOV lane with only one occupant, but granted free parking at street parking meters, in state and county parking lots, and at airport parking lots.

Those privileges sunsetted on July 1, 2020, but the state Department of Transportation extended the HOV perk for EV drivers.

DOT says it is complying with federal law come Sept. 30, but will retain language written into Hawaii’s administration rules should states be able to make their own rules once again.

Additionally, car consumers will no longer be eligible for a $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of new EVs as a result of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” adopted in July. Hawaii does not offer tax credits or rebates for the purchase of EVs.

The Electric Vehicle Association called the rollback of incentives a step in the wrong direction and “a lane change we can’t afford to make.”

EVA board member Elaine Borseth called the HOV lane perk “one of the simplest, most effective ways to encourage clean transportation,” and said it’s still necessary, given that EV adoption is still in a critical growth phase.

“We’re on our way, but we’re not there yet,” she said in a recent blog post. “Removing low-cost, high-impact incentives like HOV access risks slowing the momentum just when we need it most.”

EVs on the rise

Noel Morin, president of the Hawaii EV Association, said it is unfortunate to see these barriers to adoption, especially as sales are gaining momentum in the state.

The perks and tax incentives appear to have spurred the growth of EVs in Hawaii, with year-over-year increases over the past five years.

In July 2021 there were 15,551 registered EVs in Hawaii, which more than doubled to nearly 33,000 by July 2024. As of July this year, the state counted 38,086 registered EVs in Hawaii, a 16% increase from 2024.

EVs now represent 3.5% of the more than 1 million registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“If you look at the trajectory, more people are adopting EVs,” Morin said. “As people upgrade, and rental car companies dispense of EVs, it also means you have a pre-owned market.”

The range of EV batteries has improved, and there are an expanding number of EV options to choose from in the U.S., including ones that start at lower price points from brands such as Nissan, Chevrolet and Hyundai.

Locally, the expanding pre-owned EV market also offers consumers more affordable EV choices.

The addition of tariffs and Matson’s recent announcement that it will no longer ship EVs to Hawaii complicate the market outlook, but the days in which EVs were considered a rarity in Hawaii are over.

The Tesla Model Y, despite a drop in sales, is the third-most-popular vehicle in the state, according to Hawaii Auto Outlook, two notches below the Toyota Tacoma, which has long taken the top spot.

Hawaii also has been recognized as a top state in the U.S. for EV adoption.

J.D. Power last year ranked Hawaii third, behind California and Washington, in EV adoption based on an index weighing consumer preferences and availability. Hawaii was also among the top five EV markets, with EVs making up nearly 12% of new vehicle sales in the state.

Achieving EV equity

“We see an increase in EV registrations, so it’s steadily heading in the right direction, but obviously, not fast enough,” said Jeff Mikulina of Climate Hawaii. “The timing is very unfortunate for these new changes.”

While perks help get people in the door, he said, Hawaii needs a clean transportation program that works for everyone.

“So I think it’s on the state, now, particularly with this Navahine settlement, to really focus on equity and infrastructure, and making those take center stage,” he said.

That means making EVs more accessible for families, renters, and rural communities, he said, and investing in more charging stations, particularly for multifamily units — and doing everything possible to make clean transportation “the default as opposed to a luxury.”

DOT released a 205-page draft of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of a settlement of a lawsuit – Navahine vs. DOT — filed by a group of young climate activists.

Public comments on the draft were due by the end of Sunday.

As a legislator, Lowen has introduced bills seeking to expand EV charging infrastructure, including one offering rebates for EV-ready parking stalls in new affordable housing developments.

Morin agreed much more needs to be done to accelerate the adoption of EVs in the state if Hawaii is to reach its clean-energy goals.

Hawaii consumes nearly 40 million gallons of gasoline and diesel each month, and gas and diesel vehicles still make up 93% of all registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“It’s not just about EVs,” Morin said. “It’s about sustainable transportation. It’s about efficient transportation.”

That includes expanding other options like public transit, biking, walking, and rideshares.

“We want to be independent of fossil fuel imports,” Morin said. “We don’t want to be dependent on ships coming in to turn on our lights, transport our kids, or do our jobs. One way to do that is to achieve these goals.”

While it’s going to “take a little longer to make it happen,” he said, it doesn’t change the urgency of those aspirations.

Education is still a part of it, and Hawaii EV is hosting events locally from Sept. 12 to Oct. 12 to raise awareness on the numerous benefits of electric cars, trucks, and motorcycles as part of National Drive Electric Month.

Mikulina said the timing of the federal cutbacks is unfortunate, but is nevertheless confident that market demand for EVs will not go away, as global trends show the future is electric.

“Really, I think the momentum is so strong to electrify transportation and for clean energy,” said Mikulina, “that this is this is just a speed hump.”

CHANGES AFOOT FOR EV DRIVERS

>> On Sept. 30, the right to use the HOV lane during rush hour by solo EV drivers ends.

>> Where are HOV lanes? Oahu, the most populated isle in Hawaii, is home to most HOV lanes, which are available on the H-1 highway weekday mornings, as well as on H-2, Nimitz, Moanalua, and Kalanianaole highways.

>> On Sept. 30, federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible new EVs, and up to $4,000 for used EVs expires. These tax credits were originally set to last through Dec. 31, 2032, under the Inflation Reduction Act.

>> What to know: The IRS says a contract signed or down payment made for an EV before Sept. 30 is still eligible, even if the car is delivered at a later time. The vehicle must be acquired with a written binding contract before Sept. 30.

>> Starting in July, Hawaii EV owners could choose between paying a per-mile road usage charge of $8 per 1,000 miles, capped at $50, or annual fee of $50 (replacing the $50 EV surcharge). In 2028, all EV owners must pay the per-mile usage charge.

Property Council Illawarra Shoalhaven Regional Director Matthew Wales said the announcement was a major win for the region, reflecting years of advocacy for investment in Port Kembla’s future.

“Port Kembla has always been the industrial heartbeat of the Illawarra, and today’s announcement sets the stage for it to become the region’s growth engine for the next generation,” Mr Wales said.

“Our members have consistently called for government and industry to work together on a long-term plan for Port Kembla. We are proud to see this vision taking shape with a rezoning proposal that unlocks new industries while preserving the site’s proud industrial history.”

Mr Wales said the Property Council has long championed the need for a diversified Illawarra economy, with the Port Kembla Master Plan at the centre of that ambition.

“BlueScope’s master plan shows what’s possible when we plan big – thousands of jobs in emerging industries, billions in new investment, and a secure future for local workers,” Mr Wales said.

“With this rezoning now on exhibition, we look forward to working with government, BlueScope and the community to ensure the delivery of this transformational project.”

The Property Council has previously called for state investment to support Port Kembla’s expansion, recognising the precinct’s potential to underpin economic growth and create a multi-faceted industrial hub for the future.

“We’ve consistently highlighted the opportunity to unlock underutilised land around the steelworks to attract new industries and create a stronger future for the Illawarra,” Mr Wales said.

“This project is about giving local workers and businesses the confidence that Port Kembla will remain the region’s industrial engine while opening the door to new careers in advanced manufacturing, clean energy and technology. That certainty is exactly what investors, educators and contractors have been waiting for.

“This site might be the same size as Monaco, but it won’t be luxury yachts, casinos and Formula One, it will be proudly Illawarra – practical, hardworking and focused on building the industries of tomorrow.”

“The Property Council will continue to work with all partners to make sure this momentum translates into lasting jobs and opportunities for the community,” Mr Wales said.

Spiro and Catholic Church Partner to Roll Out Solar-Powered Swap Stations Across Kenya

Spiro, one of the leading electric mobility companies in Africa, has just signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Catholic Church in Kenya to establish solar-powered battery swap stations nationwide, advancing the country’s transition to clean and affordable mobility.

Spiro says this initiative is the first of its kind at this scale, combining Spiro’s e-mobility technology with the Catholic Church’s trusted grassroots presence to expand access to affordable, renewable energy solutions across urban and rural Kenya. The Catholic Church has a big presence in Kenya. For example, the Archdiocese of Nairobi, which covers two counties (Nairobi and Kiambu Counties), has 16 deaneries, 127 parishes, and over 4,000 small Christian communities. Across the whole country, the Catholic Church has over 1,000 parishes and over 5,000 mission stations. Facilities ranging from schools to healthcare centres, as well as other real estate, form quite a large portfolio.

“Rolling out solar-powered swap stations marks a new chapter in Kenya’s clean mobility journey. By combining renewable energy with our battery swapping technology and working hand in hand with the Catholic Church, we are ensuring riders can power their journeys affordably, sustainably, and closer to where they live and work,” said Kshitij Sharma, Spiro Kenya country head.

“The Catholic Church is committed to initiatives that safeguard creation and promote the wellbeing of our communities. Partnering with Spiro to establish solar-powered battery swap stations aligns with our mission of stewardship and service, bringing affordable and clean mobility solutions closer to the people we serve,” said Fr. John.

Spiro says the rollout will be phased across the country, helping Kenya cut emissions, lower transport costs, and advance its climate action goals. By embedding clean energy infrastructure within communities, the partnership is set to unlock new green jobs, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and make sustainable transport accessible to millions.

Spiro adds that this MoU reflects Spiro’s wider mission to transform Africa’s transport ecosystem through locally manufactured, green mobility solutions while collaborating with institutions that hold deep trust and reach at the community level. This collaboration came out of the blue. It’s one that you wouldn’t normally expect. But it’s an interesting one that makes a lot of sense. The motorcycle industry is a vital pillar of Kenya’s transport system. There are about 4 million vehicles registered in Kenya. Motorcycles make up over 50% of the country’s fleet. It’s no surprise then that motorcycles are seeing most of the action in Kenya, and at the moment, the motorcycle sector is the main driver of electric vehicle adoption. In 2024, just over 7% of new motorcycle registrations were electric, followed by 4% for electric tuk tuks, 1.1% for electric buses and minibuses, and then 0.18% for electric cars.

As the Catholic Church is embedded in the community with a wide presence, people going to church or other business at Catholic Church facilities will no doubt include a large portion getting there via motorcycle taxi. Leveraging this large network and real estate to facilitate adoption of electric mobility supported by solar-powered swap stations at these Catholic facilities looks like a great initiative. A good number of these facilities would naturally be in rural areas as well. Therefore, implementing this solar-powered swap station there would help improve connectivity in these areas as well.

This collaboration got me thinking. Smart partnerships between the new electric mobility companies and existing local organisations can help propel the electric mobility industry to new heights at a much faster pace. In general, the electric mobility sector in most African countries has been driven by startups without much government support. We haven’t seen the kind of financial incentives that helped propel the EV sector in Europe, North America, and China. In a lot of African countries, the transition has been led by locally developed solutions solving real-world everyday problems, resonating with the target market and driving initial uptake. In sectors such as the motorcycle industry, the unit economics just made sense, and customers in the target segments clearly saw the potential savings on fuel and general operational costs, enticing them to switch to electric motorcycles.

Armed with results from real-world pilots, several firms have managed to raise significant funds from investors, helping them grow from early pilot phase to early commercialisation, and some have even grown to full commercial operations. Besides traditional equity and debt contributions, which can be quite hard to close for startups on the African continent, especially in a new sector such as electric mobility, innovative partnerships could provide a pathway to sustaining these businesses. In all of these markets, there are family owned or even larger businesses that have been operating in those markets for decades, accumulating decades of local market expertise, including how to navigate the local business environment. These businesses would have accumulated loads of cash over the years and would be looking to diversify and put some of that money to use in a forward-looking industry.

Another area to leverage is these organizations would have built a very large client base and network that these electric mobility startups could plug into, providing a good base to start with and scale. Just like in the case of the Catholic Church, some of these organisations could have large real estate portfolios, which in some cases are underutilised, and partnerships with electric mobility startups could open up win-win scenarios where the mobility startup gets access to prime sites for infrastructure such as EV charging and battery swap stations and the owners of the properties get to earn some additional revenues and unlock efficiencies. I think the industry will grow more via leveraging these local partnerships. This will help get it to a level where large institutional investors will start to notice and get the confidence to invest in mobility companies as they usually do in other areas. This will also give confidence to larger traditional investors such as the large pension funds that want to invest in less risky portfolios. I hope we start to see more collaborations like this.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kenya-Spiro-elecric-motorcycles-Catholic-Church.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 18:02:48.091205

Here in Connecticut, we’re not backing down. This fall, we have important opportunities to defend clean energy, and make sure people know the facts about what’s at stake and how we can take action together.

Although this bill passed, federal clean energy tax credits are still available, but only for a limited time.

Families can save thousands of dollars while reducing pollution:

$4,000 back on a used EV, or instant savings when you lease one before September 30th 2025.

Households can also receive up to $1,000 for installing a home charger. For home energy upgrades by June 30, 2026.

Families can claim up to $3,200 in tax credits for audits, heat pumps, and insulation through December 31, 2025.

For solar panels, home batteries, and other clean energy projects, the credit covers up to 30% back on multiple projects through 2025.

These programs were designed to save money and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. Trump’s cuts will take that away, which makes it more important than ever to claim these benefits now and speak out.

In the weeks ahead, we’re coming together to show the strength of the clean energy movement.

OFFSHORE WIND

On Friday, August 22 the Trump Administration ordered an immediate halt to work on Revolution Wind, a wind project that was 80% complete. The wind farm was being built at the State Pier in New London, and part of its electricity is coming to Connecticut bringing affordable, renewable offshore wind to our state. In all, this wind project supports more than 2,500 U.S. jobs across construction, operations, shipbuilding, and manufacturing.

You can see the Sierra Club Connecticut statement on this order.

Connecticut has committed to two gigawatts of offshore wind energy, and support is growing across the state and along the East Coast. Offshore wind is one of the most powerful tools we have to tackle the climate crisis while creating healthier communities and stronger local economies.

Offshore wind means good jobs for local workers, from shipyards and ports to electricians and clean energy technicians. It means healthier air by cutting pollution from fossil fuels so families can breathe easier. It means homegrown, reliable power that stabilizes electricity costs and reduces our dependence on imported fuels. And it means thriving coastal economies, with revitalized infrastructure and new opportunities for small businesses.

We stand with communities, laborers, and local leaders who are saying YES to Offshore Wind. Together, we can power our future with clean, affordable, and reliable energy while creating resilient places to live and work.

Add Your Name: Say YES to Offshore Wind

If action is not taken, the situation is predicted to worsen. This is because of a growing and ageing population who are more vulnerable to the impacts of air pollution, resulting in nearly 13,000 increased air pollution deaths in 2030 compared with 2015.

The research, led by Princeton University, looked at pollution sources and population. These revealed health gains from climate actions across every US state and, more locally, in nearly every US county.

Climate actions are often framed around targets that are several decades away. Yet it is increasingly clear that reducing fossil fuel combustion will bring immediate benefits for the issue of air pollution.

Xinyuan Huang, the lead author of the US-wide research, said: “Climate actions not only reduce carbon emissions but also bring significant air-quality improvements to regions with historically high pollution levels.

“Under ambitious climate policies, states like West Virginia and Kentucky could see deaths from particle pollution decrease by over 19% in 2030, demonstrating the substantial health benefits of shifting away from fossil fuels.”

Policies and actions included more renewable energy, such as wind and solar power; increased uptake of electric cars; and the electrification of freight trucks.

They also included reductions in vehicle miles travelled as well as gains from low- and zero-emission zones and decongestion charging, such as the successful scheme in New York. As in many parts of the world, decarbonising US buildings is challenging, although heat pumps outsold fossil gas boilers in the country in 2023.

Dr Wei Peng said: “Figuring out how to leverage and combine actions to maximise local benefits will be important to promote widespread public support for this transition. With a focus on the health benefits, our study aims to offer insights into this critical policy challenge.”

Separate research, published last month, found large inequalities in the health burden from fossil fuel and production and use in the US. Racial-ethnic minorities were found to experience the greatest differences in air pollution exposure and health burdens. Louisiana and Texas had the most extreme inequalities in exposure, mainly from fossil fuel production and processing.

An earlier economic analysis estimated that improvements in air pollution from net zero policies in the US could reduce early deaths from air pollution by between 4,000 and 15,000 a year in 2035, a health gain of $65bn-$128bn.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba11d7b78f296b602da23f474b235c78f8d4c73/0_0_4259_3409/master/4259.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=175e794f619789f17b9e923454be2c83",N,,2025-09-06 18:03:29.425522

Conclusion Trump’s renewable energy rollbacks exposed the sector to strategic risks but also revealed its capacity to adapt through market innovation and subnational action.","The Trump administration’s aggressive rollback of renewable energy policies between 2017 and 2021 created a polarizing environment for the U.S. clean energy sector. While federal deregulation and a focus on fossil fuels introduced significant strategic risks, market forces and state-level initiatives revealed enduring opportunities. This analysis examines how these dynamics shaped investor sentiment, corporate strategies, and stock performance in the renewable energy space.

Regulatory Rollbacks and Market Dynamics

The Trump administration’s energy agenda prioritized deregulation and fossil fuel expansion, epitomized by the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017 and the replacement of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan with the weaker Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule in 2019 [1]. These moves accelerated permitting for oil, gas, and coal projects while slowing the deployment of renewables [2]. According to a report by Renewable Energy Vulnerabilities and Fossil Fuel Revival, the administration’s policies created a “headwind” for solar and wind technologies reliant on federal subsidies, such as the 30% tax credit for solar installations [3].

However, the sector’s resilience emerged from declining technology costs and state-level commitments. Despite federal rollbacks, solar installations grew by 50% during Trump’s first term, driven by state incentives and corporate demand [4]. This duality—federal policy headwinds and market-driven tailwinds—underscored the sector’s adaptability but also highlighted its vulnerability to regulatory shifts.

Investor Sentiment and Stock Volatility

Clean energy stocks faced heightened volatility during Trump’s tenure, particularly in response to policy announcements. A 2024 Reuters analysis noted a sharp drop in the MAC Global Solar Energy Index following Trump’s re-election, as investors feared further rollbacks of tax credits and subsidies [5]. The administration’s emphasis on deregulation and fossil fuels also led to a “divergence in market performance,” with the S&P 500 rising 63.0% from 2017 to 2021, while clean energy indices lagged [6].

Academic studies further contextualize this volatility. Research published in Energy Economics found that Trump’s tweets on energy topics amplified speculative behavior in oil markets, indirectly affecting renewable energy sectors through investor uncertainty [7]. Additionally, the phaseout of federal tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by 2025 introduced a “race against time” for companies like Xcel Energy to secure incentives, creating short-term price swings [8].

Corporate Adaptation Strategies

Faced with federal inaction, corporations and states became pivotal in sustaining clean energy growth. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under Biden, demonstrated how state-level and private-sector initiatives could fill federal gaps. Even during Trump’s term, companies leveraged state incentives and international markets to advance projects [9]. This adaptability, however, came at a cost: firms had to navigate fragmented regulatory landscapes and accelerate timelines to meet expiring tax credit deadlines [10].

ESG Fund Flows and Long-Term Resilience

The ESG investment landscape reflected a similar tension. While $50 billion flowed into ESG funds in 2020 and $70 billion in 2021, reflecting strong demand for sustainable investing, outflows began in 2023 and 2024 as Trump’s anti-ESG rhetoric gained traction [11]. A CNBC analysis noted that despite these outflows, ESG assets still grew in 2024 due to market appreciation, suggesting long-term resilience [12].

Strategic Risks and Opportunities

For investors, the Trump-era experience highlights two key lessons:

1. Policy Risk: Clean energy stocks remain sensitive to regulatory shifts, as seen in the MAC index’s post-2024 drop. Companies reliant on federal subsidies face heightened exposure to policy reversals.

2. Opportunistic Resilience: Declining technology costs and state-level momentum create a floor for growth. Firms that diversify funding sources (e.g., state incentives, private equity) and prioritize international markets may mitigate federal policy risks.

Conclusion

Trump’s renewable energy rollbacks exposed the sector to strategic risks but also revealed its capacity to adapt through market innovation and subnational action. While federal policy uncertainty remains a headwind, the interplay of falling costs, corporate agility, and ESG demand suggests that the clean energy transition is far from derailed. Investors must balance short-term volatility with long-term structural trends, recognizing that the sector’s future will be shaped as much by state and corporate action as by federal policy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 18:03:21.125881

Experts predict EV sales gains through the end of the month.

Car buyers may get some good deals on EVs, analysts said.

August was Ford Motor Co.'s sixth consecutive month of sales gains, driven by SUVs and big gains in sales of electric vehicles as the nation's car buyers hurried to get ahead of the expiration of the federal EV tax credit.

On Sept. 3, Ford reported August U.S. sales increased by 3.9% to 190,206 vehicles sold in the month compared with the year-ago August. For the first eight months of the year, Ford has sold a total of 1.5 million vehicles in the United States, a 6.6% gain compared with the same period a year ago.

Sales for Ford's luxury brand, Lincoln, declined 14.9% to 8,379 vehicles sold in August and sales at the Ford brand came in at 181,827 vehicles, a 5% gain compared with August 2024.

But the big winner for Ford was its retail EV sales. Sales of EVs skyrocketed by 19% to a total of 10,671 sold in August. Year to date, however, Ford's EV sales are down 5.7% at 57,888 sold.

""The ‘pull forward’ effect of vanishing EV incentives is reflected in Ford’s electric vehicle sales last month,"" Karl Brauer, executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, on Sept. 3. ""Consumers planning an EV purchase in the next three to six months are now rushing to buy one before the federal tax break goes away on Sept. 30.""

What's driving EV sales

In August, Ford sold 18,773 hybrid vehicles, a gain of 14.5% compared with August 2024. Hybrid vehicles run on an electric motor before switching to a gasoline engine when the electric motor charge runs out.

Ford's sales of internal combustion vehicles, those that run on gasoline, inched up 2% in August to 160,762 gasoline cars sold.

Year to date, Ford's sales of hybrid vehicles are up 24% to 155,107 sold. January through August, Ford has sold 1.3 million gasoline-powered vehicles, a gain of 5.5% compared with the same period in 2024.

Sales of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E rose 35.3% to 7,226 in the month; sales of the Lightning F-150 rose 21.2% to 3,217 in the month; but sales of the limited commercial vehicle E-Transit plummeted 76% to 228 sold.

The driver behind these gains in retail EV sales is the mega-tax bill signed into law in July. That legislation pushed up the expiration date of the federal clean vehicle tax credit to Sept. 30 from its original date of 2032. That means the deadline for snagging a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a qualifying, new electric vehicle is closing in.

Edmunds.com's Ivan Drury said Ford’s straightforward marketing messages coupled with incentives that resonate with consumers has resulted in positive sales, especially in EVs.

""This is a night and day difference between last year when Ford’s EVs were sitting on the lot for 99 days on average back in August of 2024 versus this August at nearly half that with 51 day lot times,"" Drury, Edmunds' director of Insights, said. ""The EV turnaround stems from both the right mix of incentives catering towards leasing with 64% of Ford EV’s being leased versus 48% last August as well as the clock ticking on the EV tax credit expiring, putting a sense of urgency behind any potential EV consumers.""

The problem is sustainability, Drury said. He said with the tax credit set to expire, the industry will see the binge on EVs result in a hangover during fourth quarter.

Car buyers can expect EV deals

Savvy consumers can't help but be aware of the EV tax credit's impending death. For those who aren't, all they have to do is look at auto websites and ads. Some dealers are running headlines on their sites that read: ""Plug in before it powers down.""

As the Detroit Free Press reported in early August, analysts predict EV sales to be the strongest ever during the third quarter as consumers scramble to take advantage of the tax credit.

“The urgency created by the administration’s decision to sunset government-backed, IRA-era EV incentives was expected to create serious demand for EVs in the short term. If last month is any measure: Mission Accomplished,"" wrote Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox senior analyst, in a report released Aug. 13. ""July sales were near an all-time monthly record. At this pace, Q3 will be the best ever and then some, as buyers jump in before the big incentives dry up.”

Brauer told the Free Press that the EV sales spike will continue through the end of September across all EV models, ""followed by a whipsaw"" in the other direction as EV sales evaporate in the fourth quarter, similar to Drury's prediction.

""It’s a predictable pattern, one we see whenever large purchase incentives are removed from the marketplace,"" Brauer said.

In the meantime, consumers can expect to find deals as EV inventory evaporates.

""Dealers are very aware of this pattern, and those with EV stock will offer increasingly desirable pricing and financing as the end of September draws near,"" Brauer said. ""Having a large supply of unsold EVs on their lot on Oct. 1 is a position dealerships will actively avoid.""

Ford's other results

For the month, Ford sold 81,539 SUVs, a 6.2% gain compared with August 2024. Sales of pickups rose 2.4% to 105,432 sold. Sales of traditional passenger cars inched up 2.2% to 3,235 sold.

Some winners: Bronco sales rose 32% to 13,378 vehicles sold in August compared with the year-ago period. August Explorer sales soared 22% to 20,617 vehicles sold. Sales of the Maverick pickup rose 16.4% to 11,956 vehicles sold.

Some losers: Sales of the Escape were down 10.4% to 12,290 in August compared with the year-ago period. Despite Lightning sales rising, sales of the F-Series in total dipped 3.4% to 68,318 units sold in August.

At Lincoln, only the Navigator and Corsair saw sales gains. The Corsair, which Ford will stop producing by year-end, sold 2,526 units in August, a 8.6% gain. The Navigator saw a 2.5% sales gain to 1,624 units sold.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/06/USNK/86016128007-20230405-t-165518-z-201621158-rc-2-f-80-agip-39-rtrmadp-3-autoshownewyork.JPG?crop=3078,1732,x0,y160&width=3078&height=1732&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-06 15:02:58.828956

The California-based company cited insurmountable financial pressures, including failed attempts to secure investor funding and generate sufficient sales, leading to the closure of its facilities in Michigan and California as well.

The decision, announced this week, marks a significant setback for North Carolina’s burgeoning electric-vehicle and renewable-energy ecosystem. State officials, who had celebrated the project as a landmark economic win just a year ago, confirmed that the Rocky Mount-area factory is now off the table, leaving local communities grappling with dashed expectations.

A Promising Start Derailed by Market Realities

Natron’s trajectory had seemed promising. In August 2024, the company unveiled plans for what would have been the first U.S. gigafactory dedicated to sodium-ion batteries, a technology touted for its potential to offer cheaper, more abundant alternatives to lithium-ion counterparts. Governor Roy Cooper heralded the announcement, noting it would inject nearly $1.4 billion into Edgecombe County and create high-paying jobs in manufacturing and research.

According to reports from WRAL, the state approved an incentives package worth up to $56.3 million to lure Natron to the Kingsboro megasite, positioning it as one of the largest economic development deals in eastern North Carolina in recent years. This move aligned with broader efforts to bolster the state’s clean-energy profile, attracting companies focused on sustainable technologies amid global supply-chain shifts away from lithium dependencies.

Financial Strains and Operational Halts

However, cracks began to appear earlier this summer. By July, Natron paused its North Carolina plans due to funding shortfalls, as detailed in an article from the Raleigh News & Observer. The company struggled to raise capital in a competitive market where investor enthusiasm for battery startups has waned amid economic uncertainties and fluctuating raw-material prices.

The final blow came this month, with Natron confirming it would end all operations effective immediately. Sources from CleanTechnica highlighted “strong financial pressures” that rendered the business unprofitable, despite the technology’s advantages in safety and scalability for applications like data centers and electric vehicles.

Implications for Regional Economies and Industry Trends

The fallout extends beyond North Carolina. In Michigan, where Natron had operations, similar job losses are rippling through local supply chains. Industry analysts point to this closure as a cautionary tale for the battery sector, where hype around next-generation technologies often outpaces commercial viability. Sodium-ion batteries, while promising due to their use of plentiful sodium instead of scarce lithium, face hurdles in energy density and market adoption.

State commerce officials, as reported by NC Commerce, expressed disappointment but emphasized resilience in pursuing other clean-energy investments. The Kingsboro site remains available, potentially attracting new suitors in a sector still hungry for domestic manufacturing capacity.

Lessons for Future Investments in Emerging Tech

For industry insiders, Natron’s demise underscores the volatility of scaling innovative energy solutions. While the company secured partnerships and initial funding rounds, it couldn’t bridge the gap to mass production amid rising interest rates and investor caution. Comparisons to other battery ventures, such as those in lithium-iron-phosphate, reveal a pattern: success hinges on not just technological edge but also robust financial backing and timely market entry.

Looking ahead, North Carolina’s economic developers are likely to scrutinize incentives more closely, balancing optimism with due diligence. As one expert noted in coverage from the Carolina Journal, this episode highlights the risks of over-reliance on speculative tech firms in state-led growth strategies.

Broadening Horizons Amid Setbacks

Yet, the closure isn’t entirely devoid of silver linings. The groundwork laid for the Kingsboro megasite—improved infrastructure and workforce training—could accelerate future projects. Broader industry shifts, including federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, continue to fuel interest in U.S.-based battery production, potentially filling the void left by Natron.

In the end, this development serves as a reminder of the high-stakes nature of the energy transition, where innovation must align with economic realities to thrive.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-d2658df3-993e-4a1b-895b-8615664c145b.jpeg,N,,2025-09-06 15:03:11.756075

As the country pushes for greener power and energy independence, the agreement marks a major step toward making solar not just cleaner but truly local.

Starting in late 2026, Corning will supply solar wafers from its Michigan factory that T1 will use to make solar cells at a new facility in Austin, Texas. Those cells will then be assembled into panels at T1's existing Dallas-area plant.

T1 CEO Daniel Barcelo said in a statement, per Reuters: ""This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security.""

The timing is key. With solar demand rising and new federal rules favoring American-made components, this deal reduces dependence on China, currently the world's leading wafer producer, and boosts both clean energy and U.S. manufacturing.

By making solar panels cheaper and more locally available, the deal could help lower energy costs for households while also cutting harmful carbon pollution by replacing fossil fuels with clean, homegrown power.

It also supports thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs, keeping the benefits of the clean energy transition rooted in local communities.

Thanks to deals like the one between T1 Energy and Corning, more affordable, American-made solar panels are on the way, making installing solar the ultimate home energy hack.

Once panels are installed, your electricity costs can drop to near zero. If you are curious to learn more about installing solar in your home, EnergySage provides a free service that can help you compare quotes from vetted local installers with the potential of saving up to $10,000 on installations.

Running other money-saving electric appliances, such as heat pumps, becomes even cheaper, boosting savings and reducing your carbon footprint. Mitsubishi can help you find the right, affordable heat pump that meets your needs and those of your home.

This year’s fire season has been the worst in European history, driven in part by lightning-caused wildfires in Spain.
Despite these regional differences, the result was clear: virtually everyone will be dealing with more wildfire risk in the future.
More smoke from more lightning-caused fires may also coat glaciers in Canada, Greenland and Europe with dark particles that can make them melt more quickly.
Due to their remote nature, lightning-caused wildfires also tend to drain emergency response capacity away from urban areas.","The climate crisis will continue making lightning-sparked wildfires more frequent for decades to come, which could produce cascading effects and worsen public safety and public health, experts and new research suggest.

Lightning-caused fires tend to burn in more remote areas and therefore usually grow into larger fires than human-caused fires. That means a trend toward more lightning-caused fires is also probably making wildfires more deadly by producing more wildfire smoke and helping to drive a surge in air quality issues from coast to coast, especially over the past several years.

Over the last 40 years, thunderstorms and other weather conditions favoring lightning have been happening more often across many parts of the US west, including western Washington, western Oregon, the California Central valley, and higher elevations throughout the Rocky Mountains.

This trend isn’t just in the US. This year’s fire season has been the worst in European history, driven in part by lightning-caused wildfires in Spain. In Canada, huge fires this year have burned more than 200% of normal forest area, the vast majority of which were caused by lightning.

Despite the well-documented trend toward worsening fires, most climate models have been too coarse to resolve how the relationship between lightning and wildfires will change as the climate crisis deepens.

A new study published last week is the first to use machine learning techniques to tackle this problem, simultaneously looking at future changes in lightning frequency and changes in weather variables like air temperature, humidity, wind and soil moisture that can predict how likely a fire is to spread.

“The overall signal is that we will have more risk of lightning-caused fires,” said Dmitri Kalashnikov, a climate scientist at the Sierra Nevada Research Institute at University of California-Merced and the study’s lead author.

The findings come as this year’s wildfire season in the US is shifting into high gear in a manner eerily similar to what Kalashnikov imagines for the future – lurching forward after a series of dry thunderstorms tore through California earlier this week.

Thousands of lightning strikes this week have sparked at least 20 new fires and burned tens of thousands of acres across California’s Central valley and into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, with one fire destroying several structures in the Gold Rush-era settlement of Chinese Camp east of Modesto.

Kalashnikov’s team found that some places, like the inland Pacific north-west, will see a surge of lightning with a relatively small increase in overall fire risk due to a moistening environment. Other places, like the desert south-west, will see an increase in wildfire risk without much of a change in the number of days with lightning due to an overall trend towards more pervasive drought.

Despite these regional differences, the result was clear: virtually everyone will be dealing with more wildfire risk in the future. In fact, Kalashnikov’s team found future increases in the number of lightning-caused wildfires across a robust 98% of the western US “due to more lightning, or more fire weather, or both”, he said.

In a future world with limited firefighting resources, the implications of more lightning-caused wildfires are worrying.

Over a recent 15-year span, wildfire smoke killed about a thousand people in the US each year. A surge in lightning-caused fires could cause America’s smoke epidemic to take the lives of potentially more than 20,000 people a year by mid-century.

In addition to the increase in wildfire risk, Kalashnikov’s study found the biggest impact from the expected increase in thunderstorms and lightning across some parts of the west could be an increase in flash flooding and mudslides, especially in recently burned areas. More smoke from more lightning-caused fires may also coat glaciers in Canada, Greenland and Europe with dark particles that can make them melt more quickly.

Due to their remote nature, lightning-caused wildfires also tend to drain emergency response capacity away from urban areas.

Even today, a sudden lightning storm “can stretch resources really, really thin” for weeks during peak wildfire season, said Max Moritz, a University of California Cooperative Extension wildfire specialist and adjunct professor at University of California-Santa Barbara.

“Maybe a week or two later you may have a big Santa Ana wind event,” said Moritz, “then you have a real recipe for catastrophe.”

When coupled with the trend of urbanization of wildfire-prone areas that we are seeing across the west, a world with worse wildfires could place additional pressure on the insurance industry which is digesting billions of dollars of claims from this year’s fires in Los Angeles alone.

In the US, firefighting resources are stretched thin nationwide as a result of the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Park Service and a host of other federal agencies with staff throughout the west. As of late July, more than one-quarter of all firefighting jobs remained vacant at the US Forest Service, and a recent immigration raid within an active firefighting crew in Oregon has reportedly reduced firefighter morale.

Moritz sees a possible partial solution – change the way we build cities in fire-prone regions.

In addition to instituting basic fire safety building codes, Moritz envisions agricultural buffers surrounding cities that could effectively shield homes and people from encroaching fire.

“There’s a growing awareness now that live fuel moisture, the amount of water in green living twigs and leaves, is also a really strong control on fire dynamics,” said Moritz. “That’s what we have here in Santa Barbara. We’ve got an existing old agricultural belt that’s relatively thin. In the places where it still exists, wildfires cannot sweep out of the national forest and into neighborhoods.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/647c5161307ec6e2a2dc62a970a364bf67967cda/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9e438507f240b9864b85e1b73e9ec7c6",N,,2025-09-06 15:03:06.591551

Legal challenges to federal incentives, regulatory rollbacks, and geopolitical tensions are reshaping the industry’s trajectory. For investors, the implications are profound: automakers are recalibrating strategies, energy markets are reconfiguring supply chains, and sector rotations are accelerating. Understanding these dynamics is critical for navigating the next phase of the EV revolution.

Automakers: From All-Electric Hype to Pragmatic Pivots

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit at year-end 2025 has forced automakers to abandon earlier all-electric ambitions. General Motors, for instance, has scaled back its 2030 EV production targets, shifting to a hybrid model that includes internal combustion engines (ICE) and plug-in hybrids [4]. This pivot reflects a broader industry trend: Hyundai and Honda are retooling factories to produce multiple vehicle types, while Ford has delayed battery plant expansions due to uncertain demand [1].

Regulatory uncertainty is compounding these challenges. The Trump administration’s 2025 rule banning critical minerals from “foreign entities of concern” has forced automakers to reconfigure supply chains at significant cost. For example, GM’s partnership with Australian lithium producers and Tesla’s vertical integration of battery production highlight the scramble to comply with new sourcing mandates [3]. Meanwhile, tariffs on Chinese EVs and batteries—accounting for 60% of global EV sales—have further strained domestic producers [2].

Energy Markets: Resilience Amid Disruption

Battery manufacturers and renewable energy firms are adapting to a post-incentive era. The Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (§45X) remains a lifeline, but its stringent sourcing criteria—requiring 65% of materials to be U.S.-sourced—have spurred vertical integration. Companies like Panasonic and LG Chem are consolidating production facilities to meet these thresholds, while startups are exploring alternative chemistries to bypass supply chain bottlenecks [1].

Grid operators, meanwhile, are deploying smart technologies to manage EV-driven demand. Time-of-use pricing, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems, and AI-driven load management are gaining traction as utilities seek to balance renewable energy integration with peak demand [5]. California’s ongoing legal battle with the DOJ over truck emissions standards underscores the state’s role as a regulatory bellwether, with its policies still driving 30% of U.S. EV adoption despite federal rollbacks [5].

Investor Strategies: Navigating Volatility and Long-Term Themes

For investors, the EV sector’s volatility demands a dual approach: hedging against regulatory risks while capitalizing on enduring trends. Q2 2025 data reveals a sector in flux: Tesla’s Cybertruck sales plummeted 50%, while GM’s Equinox EV doubled its sales to 78,000 units [1]. Such divergences highlight the importance of stock-specific fundamentals over broad sector bets.

Sector rotation is accelerating as investors seek defensive plays. European infrastructure funds, for instance, attracted $100 billion in inflows in Q2 2025, reflecting a shift toward regulated utilities and grid modernization [4]. Conversely, U.S. equity funds faced outflows amid trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Yet long-term themes—such as AI-driven electrification and critical minerals—remain intact. Nickel and lithium producers, despite 50% of global nickel supply operating at a loss, are seeing government-backed rebalancing efforts [2].

Conclusion: Strategic Exposure in a Fragmented Landscape

The EV sector’s future hinges on navigating regulatory fragmentation. Automakers must balance short-term pragmatism with long-term electrification goals, while energy markets will need to innovate to offset supply chain constraints. For investors, the key lies in diversification: pairing exposure to resilient subsectors (e.g., grid infrastructure, critical minerals) with active hedging against policy risks. As one industry analyst notes, “The EV transition isn’t over—it’s just becoming more complicated.” [3]",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 18:03:25.030335

Three automakers benefit from increased EV sales

The $7,500 federal tax credit for buying an electric vehicle will officially end on September 30, 2025. Then poof, that massive EV incentive will be history.

Some states will continue providing tax credits until funds run out. However, they’re much lower than $7,500. For example, Maine offers $2,500.

This has started a fire under some drivers, pressuring them to get the best electric vehicle deal possible before prices increase.

Electric Ford models have benefited from a year-over-year sales increase of 20%. The Ford Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning have ballooned to about 10,671 units per month.

Kia has also enjoyed increased sales. The Kia EV9 has a 54% sales increase over last month, with 2,679 units sold.

According to Index Box, the smaller Niro EV has experienced sales increases of 39% and 57%. Kia has had increasing electric vehicle sales for the past four consecutive months.

Hyundai is the third automaker with booming electric car success. Its total sales increased by 12.0% compared to last month.

Electric vehicles are responsible for 32% of the total sales volume. Sales for one of my favorite electric SUVs, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, increased by 60%.

Crews have successfully drilled more than 18,437 feet to tap Sweetwater County’s Madison Limestone formation. The engineering feat, which took months, is a major step toward establishing what developers hope will be one of the largest carbon dioxide storage projects in the U.S.

At 3.5 miles, it’s the deepest Class VI carbon dioxide injection well in the U.S., according to project officials, and it is the second well completed for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub project. It is part of the public-private Wyoming CarbonSAFE program, which aims to identify geologic formations to permanently store carbon dioxide from industrial facilities in the region.

The average depth for an oil or natural gas well in Wyoming is about 8,000 feet or 1.5 miles, according to industry sources. Anything more than 12,000 feet is considered “deep,” by industry standards. The deepest petrol well in Wyoming is nearly 26,000 feet, in the Madden formation near the Lost Cabin gas plant in north-central Wyoming, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming.

The first well for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub reached a depth of just over 16,000 feet.

“This deeper well gives us a more complete picture of the subsurface, reinforcing our commitment to building scalable, practical carbon solutions for Wyoming’s key industries,” Frontier President and Co-Chief Executive Officer Robby Rockey said in a prepared statement.

The new well, referred to as J1-15, will provide a wealth of new data to potentially confirm years of previous modeling, which has so far suggested the Madison Limestone is capable of holding large volumes of carbon dioxide. Targeting several geologic strata, the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub could hold more than 350 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to Frontier.

For scale, a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Carbon dioxide capture and storage vision

The University of Wyoming’s School of Energy Resources partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy about 10 years ago on the CarbonSAFE Initiative. The vision is to advance the use of carbon capture technologies — filtering carbon dioxide from smokestacks — by providing a place to put the greenhouse gas.

It’s a major pillar of Gov. Mark Gordon’s Decarbonizing the West energy policy initiative, which he has said will help keep Wyoming’s fossil fuels in the nation’s energy mix while building a new commercial sector to reduce the nation’s industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

In addition to the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub project, exploration and validation efforts are underway at Echo Springs in Carbon County and at the Dry Fork Station coal-fired power plant in Campbell County. Apart from the Wyoming CarbonSAFE efforts, Tallgrass Energy is exploring a carbon sequestration project in Laramie County.

Frontier Infrastructure, a division of Dallas-based Tailwater Capital, is the primary private partner for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub. The $54 million project is backed by about $43 million in federal money, according to project officials. It’s unclear, so far, exactly which companies and gas-emitting facilities might sign on to offload their carbon dioxide, but Frontier has indicated that local trona mines and soda ash processing facilities in the southwest corner of the state will serve as its “anchor” clientele.

One potential client, the Project Bison direct-air capture partnership between Carbon Capture Inc. and Frontier Carbon Solutions, is no longer active, according to those familiar with the project. Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to ease emission regulations, many still see carbon capture and carbon storage as a growing industry in the U.S. and abroad.

Frontier Infrastructure, for its part, is dedicated to “empowering industries to meet their carbon reduction goals” and helping to ensure “that the region remains competitive in an evolving global market,” according to its website.

As for the security of existing federal funding for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub efforts, it is currently “obligated” through February, according to an SER official close to the project.

In an emergency court filing Friday, the company said a Portland judge has set up an “impossible schedule” of 160 jury trials “week after week” over 2 1/2 years. The trials are for small groups of individual homeowners to seek millions of dollars in monetary damages for homes and businesses destroyed by the blazes four years ago, PacifiCorp said.

The unrelenting pace of the trials “imperils the operations of an essential public utility on which millions of customers depend” and threatens to “impose a crushing financial burden” on the largest electric grid operator in western US, according to the filing.

The company already has been hit with almost $500 million in damages for about 90 plaintiffs following a jury’s finding in 2023 that PacifiCorp was negligent for failing to shut off power lines ahead of a big wind storm. More than 1,900 fire victims in western Oregon have yet to present evidence of damages to juries in a case that’s shaping up as one of the biggest in the state’s history.

While destructive wildfires are now an almost routine part of summer in the American West, PacifiCorp’s decision to take its chances with a jury in 2023 marked the first time a lawsuit over large-scale devastation blamed on a utility’s equipment went to a trial.

PacifiCorp has said it’s confident it will get the landmark verdict overturned on appeal. But it’s now asking a state appeals court to halt further damages trials until the appeal is resolved, which could take several years.

PacifiCorp representatives didn’t immediately respond outside regular business hours to a voice mail request for comment.

In a regulatory filing last month, PacifiCorp didn’t describe its financial risk from the 2020 fires in the same dire terms as the court filing. The company said it has paid more than $1 billion in settlements, and estimated that probable losses for the fires totaled about $2.7 billion at the end of June.

Lawyers for fire victims declined to comment on Friday’s filing. They argued in a filing last week that pausing the trials would be unfair, as the fires “left thousands of Oregonians homeless, struggling to make ends meet, and traumatized.”

In 2024, Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett warned in his annual letter to investors that wildfires have turned utilities across western US into risky investments. Utilities in California, Colorado, Hawaii and Texas have also faced billions in fire liabilities.

PacifiCorp has explored options with Oregon regulators and lawmakers to minimize its wildfire exposure, including recouping its litigation losses from customers and capping damages for non-economic claims.

Maximilian was recently joined by Mayor Tom Roach, state Sen. Shelley Mayer and Rep. George Latimer for the unveiling of the bench, which he helped secure with a $5,000 grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

The charging and connectivity bench, which is manufactured by SELS Solar, costs over $5,000 but Max – as he’s commonly known – used his negotiating skills to bring the price down to the amount in the grant, which he pursued independently.

“The bench is a renewable energy source. It’s also a public amenity, which is a bonus,” he said Thursday while sitting on his futuristic bench, which is covered with solar panels that convert sunlight to electricity using photovoltaic cells.

“People from all over White Plains can come and have a place to sit, a place to charge, free WiFi and Bluetooth,” Max said, adding that it is the only such bench in the city of some 60,000 residents.

For pedestrians who wish to do more than stop for a rest and figuratively recharge, the SB1020 stainless steel bench features USB charging ports, an inductive charging pad, WiFi connectivity and Bluetooth. The various options are displayed with blue logos on either side of the armrests.

“I want to try and make a change. If I can do this with $5,000, imagine what the city can do with a budget of $100,000,” Max said. “I want this to be a stepping stone for the city to implement more renewable energy sources. “This is a testament for what White Plains can do,”

Max said he was grateful for the city and thanked its leadership, the library and Public Works crews for their roles in bringing the project to fruition.

The student, who has attended the district’s schools since kindergarten, also praised WPHS and his teachers over the years.

“White Plains High School is a really good place and I love the learning atmosphere. The teachers really facilitate learning and make it more enjoyable,” said Max, whose brother, Josh, is entering the 10th grade.

He is already applying to colleges with the goal of entering the field of finance after first considering a career in computers.

“I used to gravitate toward computer science but with the job market right now it’s not that sustainable. So right now, finance is my go-to option,” Max said confidently.",https://yonkerstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/max.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 15:01:35.726215

That momentum is at risk of slowing as the accelerated phaseout of tax credits makes wind and solar projects more expensive.
In addition, blue states including California and New York are still pushing to expand their clean power fleets.
Following the passage of Trump’s tax-and-spending law, BloombergNEF’s revised estimate for new wind, solar and energy storage additions in the US through 2035 is 26% lower than previously projected.","President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented attack on wind and solar power as he seeks to reshape the US energy landscape and reverse the green agenda put forward by his predecessor.

Since Trump returned to office in January, his administration has taken aim at projects on federal lands and oceans, stopping work on wind farms, revoking permits, and making it more difficult for new renewable energy developments to secure approval. He’s also weakened the economics of wind and solar projects more broadly, pushing legislation through Congress that phases out key tax breaks and moving to tighten access to these incentives.

The broadsides have thrown the US clean energy industry into crisis, putting billions of dollars of investment at risk and threatening thousands of jobs. It’s a sharp reversal from just three years ago, when the sector hailed the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act under then-President Joe Biden as the most significant piece of climate legislation in US history.

Why does Trump dislike renewables?

Trump has criticised solar and wind as being unreliable and expensive. He’s called for more power to be generated from fossil fuels, namely natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear.

Renewables generation is intermittent as the sun isn’t always shining nor the wind blowing. But developers are increasingly turning to batteries to store surplus power and discharge it to the grid when needed.

Trump also isn’t a fan of how renewable power installations look, describing solar projects as “big ugly patches of black plastic that come from China” and mar farmland.

He’s been a vehement critic of wind turbines for years, falsely claiming they cause cancer and deriding them as bird-killing eyesores. Before his first presidential term, Trump lost a legal challenge in the UK to prevent an offshore wind project from being built within sight of a golf course he owns in Aberdeen, Scotland.

“Windmills are a disgrace,” he said in July after a visit to the course. “They hurt everything they touch. They’re ugly. They’re very inefficient. It’s the most expensive form of energy there is.” Looking at the levelised cost of electricity the long-term price a power plant needs to break even offshore wind is much more expensive than a new gas-fired facility, but it’s cost-competitive with coal and cheaper than nuclear, according to BloombergNEF’s assessment published in February. Meanwhile, onshore wind, as well as solar, is cheap enough to compete with a new-build gas plant.

How has Trump sought to curb wind and solar developments?

The Trump administration has harnessed its oversight of millions of acres of federal land and waters, where developers need government authorisation to build. While these areas are being made easier to explore for the oil and gas industry as part of Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda, the government is imposing standards that would essentially prevent new renewables installations.

On Trump’s first day back in office, he froze permitting for all wind projects on federal land and oceans, and indefinitely halted the sale of new leases for offshore wind development. He also directed the Interior Department to review the “necessity of terminating or amending any existing wind energy leases” and to identify “any legal bases for such removal.” Since then, a number of wind projects have been upended. This includes the Revolution Wind development off the coast of Rhode Island. The government issued an order halting construction of the project which is already 80% complete citing national security concerns. This sent shares of developer Orsted A/S to record lows and added to the Danish company’s mounting troubles. Orsted’s Revolution Wind LLC unit filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in early September, seeking to overturn the stop-work order so that it can finish the project.

For developers hoping to get past the planning stage, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has ordered that all solar and wind projects on federal lands require his personal sign-off, which could mire the approval process in red tape. The department said it’s acting in accordance with Trump’s order to end “preferential treatment” for these technologies.

As part of this mandate, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management rescinded Biden-era decisions that earmarked coastal waters for future wind turbines. This covers more than 3.5mn acres, including in the Gulf of Mexico, the New York Bight, and off the coast of California and Oregon.

How has the Trump administration targeted renewables beyond federal land and waters?

Only 4% of operational US renewables capacity is located on federal land. While the government doesn’t have direct control over clean energy developments on private property, many of those projects still need federal approvals that are being held up. In addition, the Trump administration has been trying to make the economics of wind and solar less attractive.

Trump has branded efforts to combat climate change as the “Green New Scam” and vowed to do away with subsidies for these activities. The tax-and-spending law he helped push through Congress known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases out the tax credits for wind and solar projects years before they were due to expire. On top of this, the Treasury Department has issued guidance making it harder for developments to qualify for the incentives.

There could be bad news to come on the tariff front, too. Wind turbines and parts are already subject to the 50% duties Trump imposed on imported steel and aluminium products. But the Commerce Department has opened a so-called Section 232 investigation into the national security implications of importing wind energy components, which could lead to sector-specific levies.

It also opened a Section 232 probe into imports of polysilicon a key raw material for solar modules which could result in additional duties on imports.

How have these actions impacted the US clean energy industry?

The industry had been building momentum as solar and wind power almost tripled their share of US electricity generation over the past decade, topping 15%. But it’s now in a tough spot. Billions of dollars of new factories and clean energy projects have been cancelled, delayed or scaled back since the start of the year.

Clean energy advocacy group E2 estimates that $22bn worth of projects were scrapped or downsized from January to June, and more than half of the investment lost was in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

Trump’s crackdown on renewables will likely hit smaller and medium-sized companies harder because they lack the financial moat needed to survive the instability. Larger solar developers have expressed more cautious optimism, saying they’ve been able to start enough projects that qualify for the expiring tax credits in order to continue their projects for the next several years.

The nascent US offshore wind industry is perhaps in the most precarious position given it was just starting to take off before Trump re-entered the White House.

How is this affecting energy prices?

That’s a subject of huge debate and has become a hot-button political issue. Electricity prices nationally rose at more than twice the rate of overall inflation in the past year and remained at a record high in June.

While the Trump administration says that adding wind and solar to the grid has been pushing up the cost of electricity, data shows that increased spending on power lines and poles has been the biggest driver of utility bill hikes.

Utilities have been upgrading their grids to accommodate new sources of generation and demand, and network operators are also trying to improve resilience to extreme weather events and modernise infrastructure that was built in the 1960s and 1970s.

Higher electricity costs are a reflection of tight supply as well, as aging coal- and gas-fired plants retire and power consumption rises after years of relatively tepid growth. Demand is being propelled by industrial users and the power-hungry data centres behind artificial intelligence. Slowing the deployment of renewables could exacerbate the situation.

The phaseout of wind and solar incentives under Trump’s tax-and-spending law could raise average US household energy bills by $78 to $192 in 2035, and increase annual industrial energy expenditure by $7bn to $11bn, according to the Rhodium Group.

Where does this leave the outlook for US renewables?

The threat of the federal government pulling the plug on fully permitted and nearly complete assets could make renewables developers and project financiers more wary of making long-term investments in the US, even after Trump has left office. It could also create uncertainty for states such as Massachusetts and Rhode Island that are relying on offshore wind to meet growing power demand and decarbonise their grids.

Blue states won’t be the only ones facing challenges. In red Texas the top US state for wind generation and number two for solar behind California all but 6% of new capacity added to the grid since 2020 has come from renewables or batteries, fuelling the power needs of its growing economy. That momentum is at risk of slowing as the accelerated phaseout of tax credits makes wind and solar projects more expensive.

Despite the Trump administration’s roadblocks, the US clean energy buildout is expected to continue, albeit more slowly. Solar and batteries are faster to deploy than Trump’s favoured energy sources. There’s currently a multiyear manufacturing backlog for the combined-cycle turbines used in gas plants, while new nuclear capacity whether based on conventional or next-generation reactors is many years away.

And onshore wind and solar are expected to be cost-competitive even without subsidies, according to BloombergNEF. In addition, blue states including California and New York are still pushing to expand their clean power fleets.

But the outlook for the sector has certainly dimmed.

“My prayer for our legislature is to be a good carpenter, right? Measure twice, only cut once,” Roth said. “We don't want to harm private rights. We don't want to cause danger around people.”

Political extremes and public frustration

Mitchell noted that recent disputes over energy development reflect the chaos of a political environment where ideas swing from one extreme to another. Roth agreed, adding that most Oklahomans aren’t engaged in the political noise.

“I think 80 percent of the public that’s in the middle is too busy to be on Facebook ranting with internet science,” Roth said. “I know a lot of Oklahomans who are working hard to get by.

The rules will largely scrutinise whether industrial units are compliant with environmental regulation. The overall framework for monitoring and compliance within the existing environmental framework is presently supported by the Central Pollution Control Board, the Regional Offices of the Environment Ministry, and the State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees. They have, however, been facing significant constraints in terms of manpower, resources, capacity and infrastructure. “These limitations have hampered their ability to comprehensively monitor and enforce environmental compliance across the vast number of projects and industries operating nationwide,” said a press statement by the Environment Ministry. This scheme aims to bridge the manpower and infrastructure deficits faced by regulatory authorities, thereby strengthening the effective implementation of environmental compliance mechanisms.

Under the new rules, private agencies can get themselves accredited as auditors. Much like chartered accountants, environment auditors can get themselves licensed and be authorised to evaluate the compliance of projects with environmental laws and their adherence with best practices in the prevention, control and abatement of pollution. Environmental regulation has, in recent years, transcended policing and bookkeeping. Given that human-caused climate change is seen as a problem that nations must collectively fix, new dimensions to environmental regulations have emerged. Thus, audits undertaken by these agencies can also be used for compliance with ‘Green Credit Rules’, under which individuals and organisations can gain tradeable ‘credits’ for afforestation, sustainable water management and waste management among other activities. Beyond industrial units, nearly every company in India will have to account for its direct and indirect carbon emissions. This will entail fairly complex accounting practices, which are beyond what Pollution Control Board officials can handle. However, preparing for the future should not be at the expense of compromising core responsibilities. It is usually at the district, block and panchayat levels that the most flagrant environmental travesties abound, which escape notice usually because of the lack of trained staff.

“I figure I jump on it before it went away,” said Cole Meyers, a customer who decided to purchase an electric vehicle before the credit expires.

The federal EV tax credit offers up to $7,500 for new electric vehicle purchases and up to $4,000 for used EVs. Buyers have until Sept. 30 to claim these discounts.

“How beneficial is that for you to do this now and take advantage of the rebate. Oh, it’s huge. I mean, it’s a huge chunk of money that comes off the top,” Meyers said.

Brad McAreavy, president of Rochester’s Automobile Association, noted the potential short-term impacts of the credit’s expiration.

“Anytime incentives go away from the auto industry you know you usually have a little bit of a slump after it and most people are using that tax credit not just on a discount but to help get financed,” McAreavy said.

McAreavy also said they have seen a spike and expect it to continue all the way through September.

As technology and battery improvements advance, McAreavy believes vehicle prices will decrease, making them more affordable.

Martin Klima, Chief Customer Officer, SilverDoor

Corporate travellers are switching from the East to the West Coast with demand for US West Coast corporate housing across key locations including California, Washington, Seattle and Silicon Valley rising by 44% YOY for the last quarter. At the same time, ongoing legislation changes and uncertainty ahead of the upcoming mayoral election scheduled for November coupled with average daily rate (ADR) rising 41% YOY for the last quarter, are also impacting the decline in corporate demand for New York. These are some of the findings in SilverDoor’s latest Quarterly Market Update report published today. With enquiries for New York City down by nearly a third – 29% - for the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year, it has been replaced by Dubai in the top five cities for corporate demand according to the latest SilverDoor booking data:

London

Singapore

Madrid

Amsterdam

Dubai

Corporate demand and mobility are growing from the advancing technology sector which is continuing to increase its footprint across the West Coast and towards the southern states. The advance of AI and machine learning investment is spearheading the combined 44% growth in demand YOY for this quarter across Seattle and California’s Silicon Valley. Likewise further south, Houston in particular continues to offer comparatively lower operating costs, more favourable tax rates and a significantly lower ADR compared to New York such that as corporates continue to diversify operations beyond core cities, bookings for the popular Texas city are up 58% YOY this quarter.

The ever-advancing growth in AI investment is also having a ripple effect across the Pacific into the APAC region. Whilst Singapore demand remains high, it is starting to soften, with a 10% decline in demand YOY and ADR also following suit with a similar 13.5% decline YOY for the last quarter. Conversely, growth in AI demand globally has meant growth in demand for semiconductor manufacturing particularly in Taiwan. Likewise tech sector and cloud service growth is impacting demand in Tokyo – both destinations are reporting triple figure growth of 600% and 154% increase in bookings respectively for this quarter YOY. Across EMEA it is the renewable energy sector that has delivered significant growth in destinations to more coastal locations. Investment in solar power and offshore wind farms, particularly in Spain, has resulted in a marked shift in corporate demand as bookings for a number of destinations including Bilbao, Valencia and Zaragoza are all on the rise. Bilbao bookings have increased by 50% in the last quarter compared to the same period in 2024, Zaragoza bookings are up five-fold, and the number of room nights booked in Valencia in the last quarter is up 380% YOY. An increase of bookings by 65% YOY for the last quarter has seen Dubai claim a place in the top five with growth in demand for the region primarily coming from not only an increase in extended stays but also an increase in relocation assignees from the financial, law and pharmaceutical sectors, all of which are increasing investment across Dubai and the Middle East. Commenting on the report, Martin Klima, SilverDoor Chief Customer Officer, said, “These latest demand trends reflect a continuing wider shift in both corporate travel and operating policies. As businesses continue to balance their own growth plans against wider geopolitical and economic landscapes, diversifying operations and locations can be one way to achieve just that. Growth in regions beyond the more traditionally popular hubs like New York City towards cities in western and southern US states, and likewise the significant APAC demand growth in Taiwan, indicate where corporates are committing to investing their funds and placing their people. “As AI, technology, and renewable energy investment continues, it will be interesting to watch how the diversification trend evolves in the coming months and the impact it will have on demand across both the serviced apartment and wider accommodation sector both, from a short-term and longer-term perspective. “Growth in serviced apartment usage also comes with a shift in how corporate travellers are choosing their accommodation. Guests are increasingly keen to return to a particular apartment or operator if and when budgets and policy allow, particularly for longer stays where assignees have come to know and trust a specific operator. Pointing to more brands now having a strong presence in different markets and delivering consistent levels of service and quality throughout their portfolio, this brings with it the potential for increased loyalty across the sector.” The full SilverDoor Market Update is now available to read here *Figures from SilverDoor’s own booking data.

“Minnesota has a massive need for tree seedlings,” Ingmire said.
He's also been selling seedlings at his Bemidji Natural Choice Farmers Market booth, and says having them there gives him an opportunity to talk about the project.
We’ve got different insect pests and fungal pests that are putting stressors on trees just because of the temperature extremes.","NARY — Brian Ingmire’s mission to help reforest northern Minnesota with trees from south of here became a lot more important after the June 21 storm that leveled millions of trees in the Bemidji area.

Ingmire and his wife, Trina, own the 10-acre New North Farm southeast of Bemidji in Hubbard County. They sell Certified Naturally Grown produce at Bemidji’s Natural Choice Farmers Market on Saturdays. They also raise sheep and chickens.

Brian is a member of the Farm & Forest Growers Cooperative, a network of small farms and nurseries that grow climate-adaptive tree seeds into seedlings, and then sell the seedlings to reforestation agencies and individuals.

The program is headed by Dr. Julie Etterson, Distinguished McKnight Professor at the University of Minnesota Duluth’s Swenson College of Science and Engineering.

“Minnesota has a massive need for tree seedlings,” Ingmire said. “Something like 10 million trees are needed every year at a minimum. And we have a lot of forest disturbance, whether it’s fires or wind events.”

Ingmire figures he has about 30,000 tree seedlings on his farm, and about two-thirds of them will be available for purchase this fall. Online orders can be placed at climatesmarttrees.com . He's also been selling seedlings at his Bemidji Natural Choice Farmers Market booth, and says having them there gives him an opportunity to talk about the project.

New North Farm is one of 24 members of the cooperative. Ingmire is growing several varieties, including red oak, burr oak, yellow birch and silver maple. All are collected from about 200 miles south and then started up north.

“I can tell you where their parent tree came from,” Ingmire said. “They should be able to handle the changes in temperature extremes. We’ve got different insect pests and fungal pests that are putting stressors on trees just because of the temperature extremes. These trees should have the genetic ability to deal with that kind of extreme.”

The need for reforestation was certainly exacerbated in the Bemidji area after the June storm. It is estimated that Beltrami County lost nine million trees, and many were also downed in parts of Hubbard and Cass counties.

“That number exceeds a lot of the nursery capacity that we have,” Ingmire said.

Trees that are purchased this fall should be planted right away to ensure their survival.

“Most of our sales will be done for spring planting,” Ingmire said, “but I would like to see as many available in the fall as possible. I think the trees do better when they're planted in the fall. But you've got a very narrow window here in northern Minnesota between when trees drop their leaves and when the ground freezes. Some years you've got a month to get all that done, and some years you've got two weeks.”

He said trees that are not sold this fall will be kept in cold storage at UMD and will be available in the spring.

Listening to Ingmire talk about the seedling program, his gardens and forest ecology, it’s clear to see his passion for science and the environment.

""In a lot of ways it’s a spiritual thing for me,"" he said. ""You either set everything aside and you take a preservationist mindset where nature's best left without man touching it, or you recognize that we as humans have a unique role and responsibility to participate and be part of the natural world. There's really no separation between the two of them.""

He noted that the impacts humans have are global, but that these impacts start on a local level.

""One tree at a time, or one farm that's growing vegetables that feed people. So you can choose to participate in a lot of different ways,"" Ingmire said. ""The way that I choose to participate is to imagine and envision what it could be, and then work to model that and make it happen. And help other people do the same.""

Ingmire's full-time job is with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture as a water certification specialist. It’s a position that allows for flexibility, especially during the growing season, and it also allows him to visit with farmers throughout the region.

He has a degree in natural resources and environmental maintenance from Ball State University in his native Indiana. He did graduate work at Western Kentucky University and Indiana University before becoming a science teacher at the junior college and high school level.

After that, he managed water quality programs for the Environmental Protection Agency and spent 13 years as a conservation planner and trainer with the United States Department of Agriculture.

The Ingmires moved to Minnesota nearly four years ago after he started his current position with the MDA. But finding the right place to live was a bit of a challenge for Brian and Trina.

“It was right in the middle of COVID,” Brian said. “Interest rates were starting to go up. Everybody was racing to get a place.”

The couple had planned to visit five properties in the Bemidji area, but by the time they arrived, three of them had been sold.

“The first one we looked at was just a nightmare,” Brian said. Even the farm they bought didn’t look right when they pulled into the snow-covered driveway.

“It looked horrible,” Brian said. “We didn’t have any photos of the inside of the house. The doors were open on the sheds when we pulled in. It hadn’t been plowed. But then we got into the house and it had a bank of south-facing windows and all the sun was shining through. We thought, ‘This is it. We can do this.’”

Fast forward four years, and Brian and Trina have created a pristine and productive farm, with a lot of sweat equity and a little help from their hungry sheep.

“I was looking at soil maps and thought it should be good,” Brian said. “It’s prime agricultural land. We had a lot of little surprises when everything thawed. There were piles of trash, it was all grown over and full of boxelder. Kind of daunting, but I was ready for it. I was just ready to have my own piece of land, and I had ideas I wanted to try out.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/6270a4e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x4284+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F20%2Fa80e09dd49a3ae86822b44a6ae3b%2Fingmire2.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:08:39.440485

The internet titan has silently removed its goal to ""pursue net-zero emissions"" across all operations by 2030 from its Sustainability webpage, as first spotted by Canada's National Observer.

An update to Google Sustainability's ""Operating sustainably"" landing page, now renamed to ""Our operations,"" has removed its first headline broadcasting Alphabet Inc.'s long-stated goal to achieve net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030. The new page adds details on Google's sustainability goals in recent hardware releases, but shirks any mention of a net-zero climate policy or a carbon footprint beyond the aluminum used in constructing Google Pixel phones.

After the National Observer first reported on the change, a spokesperson from Google clarified the company's carbon emission policy. ""Our most recent environmental report shows a 12% reduction in data center energy emissions in 2024,"" reads the press statement. ""This was achieved by bringing new clean energy online, even amidst increased energy demands. In 2021, we set out an ambition to reach net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030. We continue to work towards this ambition.”

Likewise, Google's Data Centers Sustainability webpage also maintains the net-zero carbon by 2030 pledge is still in place at the firm. But the wording around it has now shifted to framing the goal as more of a moonshot than a guarantee. This was seen as inevitable by many as in 2023 and 2024, Google transitioned away from its practice of buying carbon offsets to achieve a ""technically carbon neutral"" status, now striving for a more robust and substantial carbon effort.

Possible Reasons Behind the Change

Still, seemingly hiding the net-zero verbage from view on its flagship sustainability website is a noteworthy choice by Google. Two major shifts in 2025 may have something to do with the decision: Google's spiraling AI energy costs and the U.S. government's crackdown on climate change initiatives.

Google and other AI hyperscalers have been continually purchasing and building data centers to meet perceived AI demands since the field opened wide last year. As a result of Google's major strategy shift towards AI, the company announced that its greenhouse gas emissions climbed by 48% in the past year, noting then that this boom would make the 2030 goal a challenge.

On the other hand, the Trump administration has been advancing its strategy on climate action and carbon emissions. After taking down a number of government websites discussing climate change upon coming into power, the U.S. government has begun championing the use of ""incredibly clean"" coal power plants.""

Now that Google seems to be officially considering its climate plans as a long shot more than a real commitment, what its path forward looks like will likely be somewhat in flux.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZBz8tMdiR9FaRK5xeafByT.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:06:07.771924

Spring Hill makes the Cadillac Lyriq SUV and Vistiq, while Fairfax is currently closed as the facility prepares to produce the Chevrolet Bolt EV.
The strategic adjustments at Spring Hill also include a temporary reduction in staffing levels, the memo also said.
About 700 employees will be laid off at Spring Hill, GM confirmed.
Still, Ford reported its retail EV sales skyrocketed by 19% to a total of 10,671 sold in August.","Spring Hill makes the Cadillac Lyriq SUV and Vistiq, while Fairfax is currently closed as the facility prepares to produce the Chevrolet Bolt EV. CAMI produces the BrightDrop electric delivery van.

The production changes come on the heels of partial shutdowns at the electric vehicle manufacturing plant Factory Zero, in Detroit-Hamtramck.

General Motors' Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee is planning several weeks of downtime in the coming months, according to a memo obtained by the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.

Additionally, the Detroit automaker told the Free Press on Sept. 4 that it is adjusting future production plans at its Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas City, Kansas, and at its CAMI Assembly Plant line in Ontario, Canada.

Spring Hill makes the Cadillac Lyriq SUV and Vistiq, while Fairfax is currently closed as the facility prepares to produce the Chevrolet Bolt EV. CAMI produces the BrightDrop electric delivery van.

“General Motors is making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand by leveraging our flexible ICE and EV manufacturing footprint,” GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said in a statement.“ GM's U.S. manufacturing footprint remains our strength, and we are in the process of investing nearly $5 billion over the next two years to further increase domestic vehicle production, enabling the ability to assemble more than 2 million vehicles per year in the U.S.”

Spring Hill will close the week of Oct. 6 and the week of Thanksgiving, as well as the full month of December, according to the memo sent to employees Sept. 3. The change will impact vehicle assembly as well as the teams that assemble battery packs for EV batteries, GM confirmed. Ultium Cell employees will not be affected.

Separately, Fairfax Assembly, which ended production earlier this year of the Cadillac XT4 and the Chevrolet Malibu, is no longer planning to add a second shift once construction ramps up on the Bolt. GM said this summer it plans to begin assembly of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox in Fairfax by mid-2027.

Plans were to start with one shift in November, according to the company website, but now GM says it will wait on market conditions before making the decision to expand to a second shift.

Meanwhile, the production pause at CAMI will be extended through Nov. 17. CAMI Assembly had run two shifts while producing Chevrolet BrightDrop vehicles, but GM said in April that the plant would initiate temporary layoffs. Unifor said those layoffs would last through October. During this downtime, GM says it plans to complete retooling work to prepare the facility for production of the 2026 model year of commercial electric vehicles.

When production resumes, the plant will operate on a single shift for the foreseeable future — a reduction expected to impact 450 workers.

Factory Zero also altering plans

The production changes come on the heels of partial shutdowns at electric vehicle manufacturing plant Factory Zero, in Detroit-Hamtramck.

Last week, GM told employees that the plant would partially shut down some first- and second-shift production starting after Labor Day and that it would resume Oct. 6. Meanwhile, the temporary layoff in place for second-shift production that GM announced in April was extended until Oct. 6. The move impacted production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ and approximately 360 employees were laid off.

The strategic adjustments at Spring Hill also include a temporary reduction in staffing levels, the memo also said.

About 700 employees will be laid off at Spring Hill, GM confirmed.

Spring Hill Vehicle Assembly and the battery operations on site expect to be running on first shift only from January to May 2026, per the memo. Impacted employees will be placed on layoff status and may be eligible for sub-pay and benefits in accordance with the National UAW/GM contract.

“We understand this is difficult news. At the same time, it's important to remember Spring Hill has a bright future ahead,” the memo said. “We've earned multiple product allocations, including the next-generation Cadillac XT5 and the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer, thanks to your strong business performance, high engagement and track record for launch excellence.”

EV sales are strong, but uncertain

Electric vehicle sales soared in July and August as buyers tried to take advantage of up to $7,500 in federal tax credits before the Sept. 30 deadline.

Automakers preparing for a slowdown are starting to make production announcements now, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry.

“Given the situation with the tax credits going away at the end of the month, cars that would have been bought in the fourth quarter are being bought now,” he said. “Automakers are going to adjust their production in accordance with what they're selling.”

GM said Sept. 2 that sales of more than 21,000 EVs combined from Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC set an all-time record for the automaker.

Still, the company is bracing for an EV sales falloff, and Duncan Aldred, GM senior vice president and president of North America, said in a statement the company would be mindful of its EV production plans.

“We’re expecting strong demand once again in September. The question, of course, is what’s next? There’s no doubt we’ll see lower EV sales next quarter after tax credits end Sept. 30, and it may take several months for the market to normalize,” Aldred said. “We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won’t overproduce.”

On Sept. 3, Ford Motor reported gains in August U.S. retail sales, driven in a large part by EV sales. It's unusual because EV sales had been muted, given that demand for them had not been as strong as the industry had predicted it would be a few years ago. A lagging charging infrastructure and high price tags for EVs had hampered sales just 12 months ago.

According to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for a new EV across all brands for July was $55,689. By comparison, the average transaction price in July for a new car in general was $48,841.

Still, Ford reported its retail EV sales skyrocketed by 19% to a total of 10,671 sold in August. But for the first eight months of the year, Ford's EV sales are down 5.7% at 57,888 sold compared with the year-ago period.

Analysts said any EV sales gains are not sustainable this year. That is why GM is making adjustments to production now.

Karl Brauer, executive analyst with iseecars.com told the Free Press that the EV sales spike will continue through the end of September across all EV models, “followed by a whipsaw” in the other direction as EV sales evaporate in the fourth quarter.

“It’s a predictable pattern, one we see whenever large purchase incentives are removed from the marketplace,” Brauer said.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2023/03/16/PDTF/0ec0d5ca-19cc-4f6a-b7da-a0b535b551f0-IMG_Cadillaclyriqevent05_1_.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y152&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-06 12:05:15.712906

Agen said building out nuclear power is the third prong of the Trump administration’s approach to winning the artificial intelligence race against China after extending the lifespans of aging coal plants that are retiring and increasing the efficiency of the existing electric grid.

In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has deployed a range of tactics to stop offshore wind expansion, which was a cornerstone of former President Joe Biden’s efforts to combat climate change but has struggled with soaring costs and supply chain snags.

Most notably, Trump’s Interior Department late last month issued a stop-work order on the Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, which is 80% complete.

Agen dismissed criticism that revoking permits for nearly-completed renewable energy projects causes instability and uncertainty, saying the Trump administration is sending a signal that projects that will succeed will not be reliant on tax credits or subsidies.

“If you want to invest in a project that you can be financially viable in, and you’re not reliant on tax subsidies to do it, I think that’s the message that we’re trying to show and I think that we have seen success on the fossil fuels,” he said.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said.","The “one big beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law in July is set to upend many aspects of American life, including climate policy. The law, which Republicans backed en masse, not only derails the nation’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could also strike a blow to consumers’ pocketbooks.

From a climate perspective, the legislation’s most significant rollbacks are aimed at industries such as renewable energy, not individuals. But there will be very real impacts for taxpayers hoping to decarbonize their homes.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, provided tax credits for climate-friendly purchases ranging from heat pumps to solar arrays through 2032. That time frame has been cut to as little as a few months.

“This bill is going to take away a lot of assistance from consumers,” said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He noted that two million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.

The good news is that the law does not affect the billions of dollars that the IRA already sent to state efficiency and electrification rebate programs, and that much of that money will remain available beyond the federal sunsets. But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.

“If consumers are able to make the investment now,” he said, “it will help them out.”

For those looking to act, Grist shares a roundup of when credits will go away.

Buy an EV before October

New electric vehicles that meet federal domestic manufacturing requirements qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. While credits on foreign-made EVs aren’t offered directly to consumers, automakers do get them and often pass the savings along through leases. Used EVs under $25,000 that are purchased at a dealer are also eligible for up to a $4,000 credit.

All of this goes away on September 30. There will be no credits after that. Ultimately, this will make new electric vehicles more expensive and put the technology further out of reach for low- to moderate-income Americans.

The income caps on the EV credits still apply, limiting the benefit on new EVs to those households earning less than $300,000 and on used vehicles to those earning less than $150,000. There is an MSRP limit of $80,000 for new cars, too.

Strangely, the tax credit for installing an EV charger (up to $1,000) runs through June of next year.

Make home improvements by the end of the year

The remarkably vast Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides up to $2,000 toward qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers. It offers another $1,200 toward efficiency upgrades such as insulation, doors, windows, and even home energy audits.

These are going away on December 31. All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates. You must have a tax bill to benefit, which may not be the case for certain low-income households.

Pay for solar this year

The most valuable IRA incentive being axed is the Residential Clean Energy Credit. It covers 30 percent of clean energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps, and there is no cap. With the average cost of a solar system in the U.S. just north of $28,000, that means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500. That credit vanishes at the end of this year, though the law refers to the “expenditures” being made by then, so that could mean paying for — but not necessarily installing — a system by then.

Like with other credits, Ungar suggests confirming any changes with a tax professional. He also said that the potential for higher tariffs is another reason to move quickly. But, he said, even after the credits go away, many of these improvements could still make financial sense over the long term.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said. “In some cases, improvements are going to be a no-brainer regardless.”",https://kvia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/grist-environmental-tax-credits_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:07:55.031852

Popularized in national energy policy discussions in the early 2000s, this strategy champions diversity in energy sources—such as coal, natural gas, solar and regional grid participation—rather than reliance on any single solution. For Kentucky’s electric cooperatives, it’s more than a slogan—it’s a commitment to reliability, affordability and innovation.

EKPC’s latest infrastructure investments reaffirm that commitment, expanding generation capacity by nearly a third while empowering co-op members with energy efficiency tools and safeguarding the future of Kentucky communities. EKPC provides electricity to 16 electric cooperatives that serve 1.1 million Kentucky residents in 89 counties.

“Diversification is really key to our portfolio,” says Don Mosier, EKPC’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. “And the projects that we’re adding today really contribute to that all of the above strategy.”

During the past three winters, EKPC has set new all-time peak demand records during extreme cold events when large amounts of electricity are used for heating. The cooperative forecasts growing day-to-day power consumption will exceed the capacity of its current fleet by 2030.

New natural gas unit at Cooper Station

EKPC plans to add a new 745-megawatt natural gas combined cycle unit at Cooper Station in Pulaski County, effectively tripling the plant’s capacity to provide power and meet future energy demands.

The new unit will bolster the regional transmission grid in southern Kentucky, and it comes as national energy monitors are warning of a shortage of electric power as the most reliable energy sources such as coal plants are prematurely shut down so utilities can comply with federal environmental standards.

“When you start talking about having random and rolling blackouts, that’s nothing that any of us want to experience,” says Chris Girdler, president and CEO of the Somerset-Pulaski Economic Development Authority. “And Cooper Station is historically—decade after decade—an incredible asset to making sure that those kinds of things don’t happen here.”

Coal and natural gas combos

Meanwhile, EKPC is protecting its most dependable electric-generating resources—existing coal-fired units—in the face of the EPA’s greenhouse gas rule that went final last year.

“And that rule basically states this: if you do nothing to your coal facilities, you must close those facilities by the end of 2031,” Mosier says. “Not that far away.”

EKPC plans to convert an existing coal-fueled unit at Cooper Station and all four coal units at Spurlock Station in Mason County to enable them to use both coal and natural gas as fuel.

With those changes, EKPC will ensure continued compliance with the existing greenhouse gas rule, even as the Trump administration attempts to implement reforms.

EKPC carefully studied but ultimately rejected the idea of capturing carbon dioxide emissions of the power plant, transporting and storing it.

“We found out that it would have devastated our members’ rates,” Mosier says. “And that’s totally unacceptable.”

“We are trying to prepare for the future, but the biggest thing is uncertainty,” says Alan Ahrman, EKPC’s board chairman. “It’s like a guessing game. What’s going to happen five years down the road?”

When the next generation reviews the bold decisions EKPC is making today, “I want them to look at it and say, we made a smart decision,” Ahrman says. “We did the best we could with the information we have.”

The co-firing projects will protect nearly half of EKPC’s existing generating capacity while reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

New natural gas plant in Casey County

EKPC plans to construct an innovative 214-megawatt natural gas power plant at a 100-acre site near Liberty, in Casey County.

Featuring 12 natural gas-fueled engine/ generator sets, the plant will be capable of rapidly starting and ramping up and down. This flexibility means the facility can support energy demands during peak usage hours or when solar facilities experience a reduction in output.

“Liberty Station will help to meet growing demand for electricity, while also strengthening the reliability of southern Kentucky’s electric grid and supporting intermittent renewables,” says Anthony “Tony” Campbell, EKPC’s president and CEO.

The plant is expected to be in operation by late 2028 and will create 23 new full-time jobs.

Expanded programs

Following a detailed cost-effective analysis, EKPC plans to more than double its investment in demand side management/energy efficiency programs, including increasing incentives for qualifying participants in the CARES low-income weatherization program.

Combined with existing programs, EKPC projects it can cumulatively reduce energy use by 69,792 megawatt-hours and cut winter peak by 38 megawatts by 2030.

Additional sources

EKPC recently secured a power purchase agreement for 100 megawatts of nuclear energy and plans to add 136 megawatts of solar capacity at facilities in Fayette and Marion counties.

“EKPC is taking steps to lower our greenhouse gas emissions intensity,” Mosier says.

“We are taking a comprehensive approach that safeguards reliability and cost-competitiveness, while boosting sustainability. Greater fleet diversity means access to low-cost energy when it is available, along with reliable, flexible power plants to keep electricity flowing when it is needed the most.”",https://d2fxn1d7fsdeeo.cloudfront.net/kentuckyliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/03102930/Cooper2_resized-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 13:02:54.432369

As summer turns to fall, we know cooler temperatures are around the corner, and we’ll be reaching for the thermostat more often.

Changes in energy policies eliminating renewable sources of energy like wind, solar and battery storage will decrease supply. This will result in higher costs for electricity and increased greenhouse gas pollution, contributing to global warming. Heating homes in the winter and cooling them in the summer is going to get more expensive as electricity costs increase. The risks of brownouts and blackouts will also increase.

New federal energy policies are putting a thumb on the scale favoring fossil fuels with greater subsidies while penalizing or eliminating renewable clean energy sources. The result will damage the environment and the economy.

The price of electricity is determined by supply and demand. Disruptive changes are underway for both.

On the demand side, virtually all planning models predict increased demand. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council predicts electricity in its four-state region could double in 20 years. The Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee predicts demand increases equivalent to adding seven Seattle-sized cities to the power grid within the next decade.

In addition to traditional population and job growth, surging electricity demand is driven by data centers feeding a voracious appetite for artificial intelligence (AI), technology and crypto-currency. Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook) and others are investing billions of dollars in data centers and they are in a hurry to bring them online as fast as possible.

Climate change is adding to new demand with increased charging capacity for electric vehicle (EV) transportation, and air conditioning. These new sources are increasing demand and accelerating timing for new energy availability.

On the supply side, disruptive change is driven by new tax policies in the so-called Big Beautiful Bill pushed by President Trump and Republicans, with the aim to effectively eliminate renewable energy sources: wind, solar and battery storage. The tax bill will subsidize fossil fuel development while phasing out tax credits for clean energy. It is part of a culture war in Trump’s fight against climate science. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin recently said we want to “drive a dagger through the heart of the climate change religion.”

As reported in the Seattle Times, “The tax plan, broadly seen as the linchpin to Trump’s agenda marks the president’s latest shot in his escalating fight against climate science.” U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said: “Washington State, stands to loose an estimated $8.7 billion in clean-energy investments.”

Renewable energy is cost-competitive with fossil fuels and costs are trending down. Renewable pricing is less volatile than fossil fuels and renewables do not generate greenhouse gases. What is more, there are no hidden “external” costs as with fossil fuels warming the planet.

Other disruptive changes include upgrading the transmission and distribution grid, and capital costs financing new infrastructure.

New demand presents challenges for the grid. Demand for AI data centers are localized while EVs and increased air conditioning are spread over larger areas. Sources for new power generation, including wind and solar, may be located some distance from where its needed. The grid must be upgraded to match supply with demand.

Financing new infrastructure presents additional challenges and risks for utilities and their customers. Utilities must make investment decisions for tomorrow’s capital needs based on current best estimates. New infrastructure and upgrades are typically financed with debt instruments between 10 and 30 years. Customers and rate payers are on the hook for these costs. Changes and uncertainty in energy markets — supply and demand — raise the risk of building capital infrastructure that fails to meet future needs. These are known as stranded assets and are borne by customers and rate payers regardless.

At a time when demand for energy is surging, the Trump administration’s response is to wage a crusade on climate science. The effect is eliminating the most cost effective and cleanest sources of energy and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. The consequences will be higher energy costs for consumers at homes and businesses, a less reliable energy supply and a warmer planet.

The winners in this mindless endeavor include China and Europe who are not waiting for the U.S. to get it’s act together on energy or climate policy (“Green revolution is booming; just not in the U.S.,” The Herald, Sept. 2). The losers in the short run will be consumers; you and me. The crusade against climate science is leading us into a new dark age; literally.

“Eco-nomics” is a series of articles exploring issues at the intersection of climate change and economics. Climate change (global warming) is caused by greenhouse gas emissions — carbon dioxide and methane chiefly — generated by human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels and agricultural practices. Global warming poses an existential threat to the planet.

Why was the Hyundai EV plant raided by ICE?

After celebrating the grand opening of its new Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA) in Georgia earlier this year, the Korean automaker said it’s “building the future of mobility with America, in America.”

On Thursday, a construction site for a new battery plant was raided by US immigration authorities. According to local reports, up to 475 people were arrested as part of an investigation into undocumented individuals. LG stated in a press release that Hyundai employees were among the hundreds taken into custody.

The South Korean Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Friday (via Yonhap News), claiming that the individuals were treated unfairly.

“The economic activities of our companies investing in the US and the rights and interests of our nationals must not be unfairly violated,” South Korean ministry spokesperson Lee Jae-woong said.

The ministry’s spokesperson added that “We conveyed our concern and regret through the US Embassy in Seoul today.” Korea sent officials to Washington and to the Hyundai plant to establish an on-site task force to deal with the matter.

The site spans nearly 3,000 acres total and includes an assembly facility, two battery plants, a weld shop, and several others for training, logistics, and more.

As the largest economic project in Georgia, the plant, including Hyundai’s suppliers, is expected to create nearly 40,000 jobs while drawing $12.6 billion into the state.

Hyundai currently builds the new 2025 IONIQ 5 and 2026 IONIQ 9, its first three-row electric SUV, at the Georgia facility.

The ICE raid came just days after US President Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House. It’s part of the administration’s aggressive crackdown on immigration. Lee has committed to investing another $150 billion in the US, including a new EV battery plant, as it seeks to ease trade tensions.

Federal agents walked into a massive Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions construction site yesterday and detained nearly 500 people on suspected immigration offenses. The site, near Savannah, Georgia, is the home of a future electric vehicle battery plant. On Instagram, video posted by an account with the name Alex Morales showed a group of people listening to a masked man who identifies himself as part of Homeland Security.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED DHS OFFICER: We need construction to cease immediately. We need all work to end on the site right now.

DETROW: Homeland Security Investigations says this was the largest single-site operation they have ever carried out. NPR's Camila Domonoske covers cars for NPR and joins us now. Hey there.

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi.

DETROW: What do we know about this workplace raid so far?

DOMONOSKE: Yeah. So Homeland Security Investigations, which is the branch of ICE that carries out this kind of workplace raid, they say that they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean. Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions - both of those companies are headquartered in South Korea. Here's Special Agent Steven Schrank speaking at a press conference.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVEN SCHRANK: Some that illegally crossed the border into the United States, some that came in through visa waiver and were prohibited from working, some that had visas and overstayed their visas.

DETROW: So who was employing the people who were detained?

DOMONOSKE: It's a good question. You know, in a project like this, there are really complicated webs of subcontractors and subcontractors to subcontractors. Hyundai says that it believes that nobody detained was directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. LG Energy Solutions hasn't responded to NPR's requests for comment.

That Homeland Security official said that this raid was tied to, quote, ""allegations of unlawful employment practices and serious federal crimes,"" end quote. He did not provide more details on that, and there are no charges filed in this case right now. Officials say this is an ongoing investigation. It would be unusual if charges are eventually filed because immigration raids like this, where workers are detained - they don't often end with criminal charges for employers.

DETROW: Tell us more about where this raid happened.

DOMONOSKE: It's on this huge campus of buildings near Savannah, Georgia, that also includes a large factory where Hyundai is right now building electric vehicles. That factory was not directly affected by the raid. Production of vehicles didn't actually stop. But the battery plant that's under construction nearby, which is where the raid actually happened - it's an important part of the long-term plans for this facility 'cause the goal is to build not just electric vehicles, but the whole supply chain for these vehicles here in the U.S.

And that's important not just to Hyundai, but actually to the United States more broadly in this effort to try to compete with China over the future of electric vehicles. So Hyundai is investing some $26 billion in moving manufacturing to the U.S., including this project. It's a big deal for the company and for Georgia. The state's called it the largest economic development project in state history.

DETROW: And I understand you just heard back from Hyundai. What did they say?

DOMONOSKE: They said they're going to conduct an investigation into suppliers and their subcontractors to make sure they are all following employment law and other laws and regulations. Meanwhile, Congressman Buddy Carter, who represents the area surrounding the plant, posted on X that he applauded the Trump administration for taking bold action. And the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it voiced concerns to the United States about respecting South Korean economic activity and citizens.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal The U.S. offshore wind sector stands at a crossroads.","The U.S. offshore wind sector, once heralded as a cornerstone of the clean energy transition, now faces a complex web of political and economic risks that are reshaping its investment landscape. While the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has provided a temporary tailwind through tax credits and funding mechanisms, policy instability—exacerbated by regulatory reversals, permitting delays, and geopolitical tensions—has introduced significant volatility into equity valuations. For investors, the interplay between these risks demands a recalibration of strategies to navigate an increasingly unpredictable environment.

Policy Instability: A Double-Edged Sword

The Trump administration’s 2023–2025 policies exemplify the sector’s vulnerability to political shifts. While streamlined permitting under NEPA reforms briefly accelerated onshore wind development, the administration’s simultaneous rollback of federal clean energy incentives—including the phase-out of the Production Tax Credit (PTC)—created a fragmented regulatory landscape [2]. This duality is evident in the fate of major offshore projects: the suspension of Empire Wind 1 and Revolution Wind in 2024, attributed to stop-work orders and permitting bottlenecks, directly eroded investor confidence [3]. According to a report by Recharge News, such regulatory uncertainty has increased project risk premiums by 15–20%, driving up capital costs and deterring private-sector participation [1].

The ripple effects of these policies are quantifiable. Norwegian energy giant Equinor, for instance, recorded a nearly $1 billion writedown on its U.S. offshore wind projects in July 2025, citing “evolving regulatory headwinds” as the primary cause [2]. Similarly, NextEra Energy’s stock price experienced sharp declines in late 2024 amid fears of potential IRA rollbacks, with analysts noting a 12% drop in valuation within a single quarter [4]. These examples underscore how policy instability can translate into tangible financial losses, even for industry leaders.

Economic Headwinds: Supply Chains and Cost Inflation

Beyond political risks, economic factors are compounding the sector’s challenges. U.S.-China trade tensions have disrupted supply chains for critical components like turbines and cables, pushing construction costs up by 30% since 2023 [3]. A 2025 Deloitte report highlights that these inflationary pressures, combined with rising interest rates, have made pure-play offshore wind developers less attractive to capital markets, with investors favoring late-stage assets offering stable cash flows [1].

The Trump administration’s 2024 tariffs on solar and battery imports further illustrate the sector’s exposure to trade policy. While these tariffs were initially framed as a boost for domestic manufacturing, industry insiders warn they could extend to wind technologies, threatening the cost competitiveness of offshore projects [1]. This dynamic is particularly acute for floating offshore wind, which relies on global supply chains and faces additional volatility from foreign exchange rate fluctuations [5].

Strategic Implications for Investors

For investors, the key takeaway is clear: policy and economic risks are now inextricably linked. The IRA’s tax credits and transferability markets have provided a floor for valuations, but their long-term efficacy hinges on political stability. A 2025 FTI Consulting analysis notes that sub-federal initiatives—such as green banks and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—are emerging as critical buffers against federal policy shifts, offering new monetization avenues through carbon attribute sales [1]. However, these mechanisms remain untested at scale, and their success depends on sustained state-level commitment.

Investors must also weigh the role of technological and industrial trends. The surge in demand for 24/7 clean energy from data centers and AI infrastructure could offset some policy-driven headwinds, as highlighted by the 2025 Renewable Energy Industry Outlook [1]. Yet, this demand is unlikely to materialize without regulatory clarity on permitting and grid interconnection.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

The U.S. offshore wind sector stands at a crossroads. While its long-term potential remains intact, the path to realization is fraught with political and economic uncertainties. For investors, the imperative is to adopt a dual strategy: hedging against policy risks through diversified portfolios while capitalizing on emerging opportunities in state-level programs and technology-driven demand. As the 119th Congress and new administrations take shape, the ability to monitor and adapt to regulatory shifts will be the defining factor in unlocking offshore wind’s value proposition.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 12:07:38.727857

Through the private provider, American Independent Power, the facility will utilize solar thermal energy and liquid nitrogen to create power 24/7.

It's another way the company is ensuring its customers will always have power flowing to their homes.

Lakeland Electric's Socrum Substation off of US 98 N will soon be the site of a small liquid nitrogen generation facility.

Sitting on half-an-acre, it'll be able to generate 5-megawatts, which provides power to about 5,000 homes.

""To put that into perspective, traditional solar would need roughly 25 acres to make the exact same power build,"" said Mike Dammer, Emerging Technology Manager at Lakeland Electric.

Through the private provider, American Independent Power, the facility will utilize solar thermal energy and liquid nitrogen to create power 24/7.

""This is different from traditional solar where the sun has to be out,"" said Dammer. ""In a thermal solar situation, we get sun heat during the day, and that heat stays through a thermal medium overnight so still solar-powered but 24/7 solar power.""

The utility company is the first in the country to pilot this project. Dammer says the neat thing about this system is its flexibility, which is why they wanted to try it out.

""This is simply a pilot, but we could take this from a one-megawatt distributed energy system at a neighborhood,"" said Dammer. ""We could make a 100-megawatt centralized system at Macintosh Power Plant, and we can do 100 things in-between.""

Big picture view:

Dammer says the goal of the project is not only to see that it works, but also to see how it works within their system.

""The goal here is we can deploy these at substations, if there's a line down between here and Mcintosh,"" said Dammer. ""We can still run power to people's houses from these systems so we want to understand how this system will inject power at a distributed level. That hasn't been done widespread across the industry yet, so we want to study that. Prudent, practical steps.""

Power regulators to take a broad view of its powers and undertake a full review of a proposed natural gas generating station to be built in Tantramar, N.B., near the Nova Scotia border.

""It would be a very large hole in the regulatory scheme if generating facilities that N.B. Power refers to as critical are not being reviewed,"" said Ryan Burgoyne during closing arguments in front of the New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board.

Provincial legislation requires the board to hold hearings into any N.B. Power capital project that will exceed $50 million in expenditures.

However, the utility is asking for a ruling that exempts the proposed new generating station, which will cost several hundred million dollars to construct, from that provision.

In a special arrangement with N.B. Power, the private company ProEnergy will build, own and operate the generating station, with the utility obliged to pay for the station's entire output for 25 years.

That arrangement should place the facility outside of the EUB's legal review powers, according to N.B. Power and ProEnergy.

The EUB is now sorting through arguments for and against that position.

""We're here to try to determine what a particular section in a particular piece of legislation allows us to do,"" EUB chairperson Christopher Stewart said during the hearing.

Burgoyne, who represents Saint John Energy, Edmundston Energy and the Perth Andover Electric Light Commission, said even though N.B. Power is not directly building or owning the new station, it is causing it to be built for its own use.

That, he said, gives the EUB authority to review whether it is a financially responsible project.

""I do not know how N.B. Power can credibly argue that this is not a capital project of N.B. Power. They can repeat that they do not own the project but that is not the test [for a review],"" said Burgoyne.

Also calling for a full review of the merits of the generating station were the New Brunswick Conservation Council and public intervener Alain Chiasson.

However, lawyers for both N.B. Power and ProEnergy argued New Brunswick legislation specific states that only capital projects of N.B. Power are subject to an EUB review.

""I don't see this in any way being a capital project of N.B. Power,"" said Len Hoyt, a lawyer acting for ProEnergy.

Stewart said the board recognized the importance of the issue and promised a decision ""as soon as possible.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7626663.1757102962!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/eub-hearing.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-06 12:06:16.632159

Dan is not a fly-by-nighter; rather, he spent seven years traveling throughout China, visiting and sampling every aspect of Chinese life he could—most of all its factories and manufacturing expertise.

I am pleased and honored to have known Dan for about 10 years. He and I have seen a Brahms concert together, and we have eaten together in Yunnan, China, where Dan was born.

An important new figure has arrived on the intellectual scene. You can sample his work with this excerpt from Breakneck. —Tyler Cowen

Americans today are rarely excited about major construction projects. This is in part because they’re associated with environmental damage, and in part because they take so long to complete.

It’s also because they’ve become so rare that people have forgotten how much they can improve lives.

Contrast this with China. Modern China has been on a building spree. It began in the 1990s, after its economic reopening took hold, and then received another boost in 2008, when the central government approved vast public works to respond to the global financial crisis.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LiRe!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4500109e-4444-4f40-a238-2368373c0b26_1024x768.jpeg",N,,2025-09-06 13:03:03.714734

He urged the commission to reject the declaratory ruling part of the petition.
The commission has not yet acted on the other part of the petition regarding the implementation of the Social Costs of Greenhouse Gases analysis.
The commissioners discussed the petition for two minutes before voting unanimously to adopt the order PSC staff drafted rejecting the declaratory ruling request.
“The PSC makes critical decisions about utility investments in fossil fuel and clean energy infrastructure that affect all Montanans,” Harbine wrote.","The Montana Public Service Commission declined to make a declaratory ruling incorporating climate change into its regulatory oversight of the energy sector.

A coalition of 41 businesses and nonprofits submitted a petition to the PSC in March of 2024 in the wake of a state district court finding in Held v. Montana that the state’s right to a “clean and healthful environment” incorporates a right to a “stable climate system.”

The petition before the PSC had two parts. One asked the agency to adopt rulings “affirming its obligation to consider the adverse climate impacts of greenhouse gas emissions under the Montana Constitution and the statutory and regulatory framework governing its decision making.” The other included a specific rule giving the commission a framework for weighing the social, economic and environmental costs of different energy sources. That framework, developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is called the Social Costs of Greenhouse Gases.

In his presentation before commissioners on Tuesday, PSC Chief Legal Staff Lucas Hamilton argued that the authority for declaratory rulemaking rests with the judicial and legislative branches, not with an executive-branch agency such as the Public Service Commission. He urged the commission to reject the declaratory ruling part of the petition. The commission has not yet acted on the other part of the petition regarding the implementation of the Social Costs of Greenhouse Gases analysis.

“Even if the commission had the authority under case law and the [Montana law] to issue that declaratory ruling, the draft order before you still concludes it would be inappropriate to do so here because the right to a ‘clean and healthful environment’ exists alongside several other very important rights, including the right to pursue life’s basic necessities,” Hamilton said in his breakdown of the order.

Hamilton then discussed state laws governing how the agency considers environmental impacts, public interests and the process by which utilities identify and compare new sources of electricity generation. Adding climate to the list of considerations would “engraft additional, mandatory requirements into those statutes that the Legislature did not clearly intend,” Hamilton said.

“Instead, you should consider evidence on a case-by-case basis and determine — only in the context of cases — exactly what rights are implicated by the parties appearing in front of you,” Hamilton said.

Lucas also flagged potential issues about creating a “very, very broad” framework for climate analysis that would be “binding against all present and potential future parties that may appear before the commission.”

“If the commission would like to do that, the proper method would be through administrative rulemaking,” he concluded.

The commissioners discussed the petition for two minutes before voting unanimously to adopt the order PSC staff drafted rejecting the declaratory ruling request.

Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar praised Hamilton’s work on the issue before cautioning his fellow commissioners that the PSC’s decision would likely land before a judge.

“This is one step. If anybody thinks that this isn’t going to court, I think they are wrong,” Molnar said. “Nationally, regionally and in the state of Montana, this is a conversation that will be going on for some time.”

Jenny Harbine, an attorney for Earthjustice who represented the petitioners in their request, nodded at that eventuality in an emailed statement issued Sept. 2.

“The PSC makes critical decisions about utility investments in fossil fuel and clean energy infrastructure that affect all Montanans,” Harbine wrote. “Under our constitution, the commission must account for the significant climate costs of its actions. We intend to hold them accountable to that requirement.”

Michael Hudson, a volunteer with Families for a Livable Climate, expressed disappointment with the commission’s “further delay” in acting on the petitioners’ request.

“We know that climate change will cost Montanans millions — in lost crops and livestock, in widespread health problems from increased wildfire smoke, lost tourism and more. The PSC regulates the single greatest source of CO2 emissions in our state, and it would make sense for them to consider its impacts,” Hudson said in the statement.",https://montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC_0354-1.jpeg,N,,2025-09-06 13:03:14.173932
,Clean Energy ,2025-09-06 12:47:58+00:00,Davis Vanguard,Op-ed | SB 131 Will Bring an Abundance of Pollution and Harm Endangered Species. It ...,Pamela Flick,,,,,https://davisvanguard.org/2025/09/california-ceqa-exemption-threat/,"In June, Governor Newsom worked with legislative leadership to push through SB 131 as a budget trailer bill.
But SB 131 mostly does not address housing.
These kinds of projects typically involve hazardous chemicals and solvents, yet SB 131 provides no environmental guardrails or conditions.
Further, most of the “advanced manufacturing” facilities will be built in and around disadvantaged communities that are already burdened by decades of industrial pollution.
Legislators’ commitment to fix SB 131 reflects the bill’s extreme nature.","In June, Governor Newsom worked with legislative leadership to push through SB 131 as a budget trailer bill. SB 131 was touted as a companion to AB 130, and both bills were sold as streamlining measures to the California Environmental Quality Act to rapidly accelerate housing development. While the verdict is still out on how much new housing AB 130 will actually create, it was indeed a housing bill. But SB 131 mostly does not address housing.

Instead, its most controversial feature was a CEQA exemption for a vague category of polluting industrial projects known as “advanced manufacturing.” Exempt projects include battery and energy storage manufacturing, lithium mining, defense and aerospace manufacturing, and semi-conductor and electronics manufacturing.

While innovation and new technology is important to California and our quest for clean energy, these types of projects still produce pollution that should, at least, be disclosed and evaluated when sited near communities and sensitive habitats. These kinds of projects typically involve hazardous chemicals and solvents, yet SB 131 provides no environmental guardrails or conditions. Further, most of the “advanced manufacturing” facilities will be built in and around disadvantaged communities that are already burdened by decades of industrial pollution.

Neither the public nor most legislators saw the language of SB 131, or knew about the “advanced manufacturing” exemption, until Friday, June 27, just three days before it was signed into law. At the Senate Budget Committee hearing on Monday, June 30, many senators expressed serious concerns about the likelihood of increased air and water pollution in their communities.

In response, the bill’s author (Sen. Wiener), Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, and other legislators committed to move clean-up legislation through the Legislature this year to address the serious concerns around the impacts of this new “advanced manufacturing” exemption.

Legislators’ commitment to fix SB 131 reflects the bill’s extreme nature. Never in 50 years has the state enacted a broad CEQA exemption for polluting industrial projects. Given California’s position of economic strength, it’s hard to understand why it is needed.

As Governor Newsom himself has been proudly touting, “California leads the nation” as the top state for Fortune 500 companies, new business starts, manufacturing, venture capital funding, high-tech businesses, and agriculture. Our state now boasts the fourth largest economy in the world.

So why are we removing common sense requirements regarding polluting industrial activities that threaten public health and the environment?

Tellingly, the state has already classified numerous metal recycling plants as “advanced manufacturing” facilities—and history shows that environmental review is essential for these projects. If such facilities are exempt from CEQA, public health in already-overburdened communities will suffer, as they’ll have no chance to understand or advocate for measures to reduce pollution.

Of equal concern is SB 131’s failure to exclude from the new exemption projects that are located on habitat for endangered and threatened species. The result could imperil sensitive species throughout California.

Because “advanced manufacturing” projects won’t require CEQA review, the public won’t be notified when a semi-conductor or aerospace manufacturing facility is built on sensitive habitat, and there will be no requirement to mitigate its impacts on species. That means that we will end up losing more habitat for declining wildlife, driving even more species to need protections. California is a world-renowned biodiversity hotspot, and our state should be doing more to avoid driving species into extinction—not giving polluting developers a pass to destroy imperiled species’ habitat.

This new framework represents a major reversal of state policy. Many legislators who felt pressured to vote for SB 131 in order to pass the state budget said this provision, too, must be fixed before the end of the legislative session. Notably, other bills that have allowed major exemptions for the environmental review process under CEQA do exclude projects located on sensitive habitat. For example, 2017’s SB 35 (Wiener) and this year’s AB 130 require projects on such habitat to undergo environmental review. Why should advanced manufacturing projects not be held to the same standard?

Time is running out to fix SB 131. Clean-up legislation must be enacted before the legislative deadline to pass bills on September 12. Nearly one-third of California’s legislators have already signed a letter calling on leadership to “expeditiously pursue legislation to address outstanding concerns on the public resources budget trailer bill, SB 131.”

California can’t afford the abundance of pollution this dangerous law will bring. Nor should we threaten more of our state’s imperiled fish and wildlife. The legislature must act quickly to fix SB 131.

Emich Volkswagen initially offered the VW ID.4, a compact crossover SUV, for $39 a month before sales tax in August.
To heighten the urgency, the Emich Volkswagen website displayed a countdown timer marking the days, hours and minutes until September 30 - the expiration date for the federal EV tax credit.
On a national scale, forecasts predict up to 38% fewer EVs on the road by 2035 without the federal tax credit.
In addition to the federal tax credit expiration, Colorado has been reducing its state EV tax credit due to revenue shortfalls.","PENNY-pinching drivers are rushing to dealerships to take advantage of EV lease deals before the federal tax credit expires later this month.

Bundling federal and state incentives has brought lease prices as low as $9 a month, which has driven a mighty surge in EV sales.

This is especially the case in Colorado, where dealerships have aggressively marketed the discounts while they last, according to CPR.

The federal tax credit, worth up to $7,500, is set to expire on September 30, prompting dealerships like Emich Volkswagen in south Denver to see packed showrooms filled with bargain-hunting motorists.

Scott Nelson, a real estate broker and customer, shared that he had wanted an EV for years but only started taking test drives after realizing these local deals wouldn’t last much longer.

“It was on our radar, but this definitely sped up the timeline,” Nelson told reporters.

After test-driving a Volkswagen ID.4 in early August, Nelson pre-ordered the vehicle to lock in the cheaper lease pricing - even if the car arrives after the deadline.

Emich Volkswagen initially offered the VW ID.4, a compact crossover SUV, for $39 a month before sales tax in August.

But starting September 1, the dealership began advertising an even cheaper $9-a-month lease on a two-wheel-drive version of the SUV.

To heighten the urgency, the Emich Volkswagen website displayed a countdown timer marking the days, hours and minutes until September 30 - the expiration date for the federal EV tax credit.

This urgency stems from federal climate policy changes, which was initially introduced under President Biden as part of efforts to combat climate change, but was later revoked under President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The impending expiration has caused a spike in EV sales nationally - although dealers remain uncertain about how busy they will be once the incentives disappear.

On a national scale, forecasts predict up to 38% fewer EVs on the road by 2035 without the federal tax credit.

In addition to the federal tax credit expiration, Colorado has been reducing its state EV tax credit due to revenue shortfalls.

The incentive, previously $5,000, was reduced to $3,500 in 2025 and is set to decline further to $750 by 2026.

These reductions are expected to slow Colorado’s EV market, which had seen it briefly overtake California as the top state for EV adoption.

The combined loss of financial incentives from both state and federal governments, amounting to $11,700, means buyers will no longer be able to access these savings once the EV programs are reduced or taken away.

Together, these changes mean buyers will miss out on major financial savings that have made EVs more affordable.

Matthew Groves, president of the Colorado Auto Dealers Association, expressed concern that fewer discounts will make EVs more expensive, which could hurt dealerships that rely on volume sales for profitability.

Groves said: “Anything that makes cars more expensive is bad for dealers.”

Colorado dealerships have been seen as leaders in leveraging EV incentives to attract customers.

Boulder Nissan, for example, offered leases as low as $9 a month for the Nissan Leaf last summer - which resulted in record-breaking sales numbers.

Ed Olsen, sales manager at Boulder Nissan, reflected on the dealership’s success.

“It’s been such a good ride over the last year and a half or so,” he said.

Now, Olsen is working to sell or lease all EV inventory - including multiple Nissan Ariyas - before September 30.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/09/2024-chicago-illinois-ford-motor-914977211.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-09-06 12:08:22.710163

With a $28 billion five-year capital plan announced in 2024, Ameren is doubling down on infrastructure modernization, decarbonization, and regulatory alignment, positioning itself as a linchpin in the U.S. energy landscape. At the Barclays 2025 CEO Energy-Power Conference on September 3, 2025, Ameren’s leadership underscored its commitment to balancing environmental goals with grid reliability, a rare feat in an industry where peers like FirstEnergy and Duke Energy are scaling back or abandoning their decarbonization targets [1].

Regulatory Alignment: A Foundation for Resilience

Ameren’s success hinges on its ability to align with evolving regulatory frameworks in Missouri and Illinois, two key markets it serves. In Missouri, new electric service rates effective June 2025 have bolstered revenue streams, enabling the company to fund grid upgrades and renewable projects [2]. Meanwhile, in Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission’s rate proposals continue to shape Ameren’s financial trajectory, with the company securing favorable terms to support its $63 billion capital investment pipeline [2]. This regulatory alignment contrasts sharply with peers like Duke Energy, which has delayed coal plant closures due to political uncertainties in “red states” [3]. By securing rate case approvals and navigating state-specific policies, Ameren ensures stable, inflation-protected returns while advancing its net-zero-by-2045 goal [4].

Decarbonization Execution: Balancing Ambition and Affordability

Ameren’s decarbonization strategy is both ambitious and pragmatic. The company is retiring less efficient coal plants while expanding low- and no-carbon generation, including solar, wind, and nuclear. Its Integrated Resource Plan emphasizes a diversified energy mix, ensuring affordability and reliability even as it phases out fossil fuels. According to a report by Ameren Missouri, the company has already made meaningful progress toward its 2030 emissions reduction targets, a stark contrast to peers like FirstEnergy, which abandoned its 30% reduction goal in 2024 to keep coal plants operational [5]. Ameren’s approach—adding 10,000 MW of renewable capacity by 2030 while maintaining fuel diversity—demonstrates its ability to execute decarbonization without compromising service quality [6].

Infrastructure Investments: Future-Proofing the Grid

Ameren’s $28 billion capital plan is not just about decarbonization; it’s about future-proofing the grid for a world dominated by electric vehicles (EVs) and distributed energy resources. The company is modernizing its infrastructure with smart grid technologies, enhancing resilience against extreme weather events and cyber threats. As highlighted in its Q2 2025 earnings call, these investments are projected to drive 6–8% compound annual earnings growth through 2029, supported by robust demand in its service territories [7]. Analysts note that Ameren’s focus on grid modernization—particularly in MISO transmission projects—positions it to capitalize on the broader shift toward decentralized, renewable-powered systems [8].

Differentiation in a Stalling Industry

While many utilities are retreating from their climate commitments, Ameren is accelerating. The company’s recent presentation at the Barclays conference emphasized its disciplined capital allocation and regulatory momentum, differentiating it from peers like American Electric Power (AEP), which has hinted at revising its “aspirational” net-zero goals [3]. Ameren’s ability to secure ratepayer support for its clean energy initiatives—coupled with its conservative yet executable capital plan—makes it a standout in an industry grappling with policy fragmentation. As one analyst put it, “Ameren is proving that decarbonization and profitability aren’t mutually exclusive” [9].

Why Investors Should Own Ameren

For investors seeking stable, inflation-protected returns, Ameren offers a compelling case. Its regulatory alignment, disciplined infrastructure spending, and proactive decarbonization strategy create a moat against both climate risks and market volatility. With a 2025 EPS guidance of $4.85–$5.05 and a projected revenue increase to $10.28 billion by 2029, the company’s financials reflect confidence in its long-term vision [2]. Moreover, Ameren’s focus on ESG metrics—particularly its hybrid renewable projects and grid resilience initiatives—aligns with the growing demand for sustainable infrastructure investments.

In a sector where many utilities are faltering, Ameren stands out as a model of resilience and execution. As the energy transition accelerates, this St. Louis-based utility is not just surviving—it’s leading.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 12:08:49.331801

However, Texas is not just looking at constructing a data center, but in creating a data center structured around sustainable and uninterupted power.
Hydrogen City, a green hydrogen and ammonia production site close by, will ensure solar and wind power is utilized to produce about 280,000 tons of green hydrogen every year.","Texas is not holding back on ensuring that the hydrogen empire continues rising and this American state is making rather bold moves to ensure that America’s energy future gets redefined. Thus far, Texas has diverted its attention to 50,000 acres of land to focus on green technology development. One region in particular is said to be the cornerstone of the hydrogen economy. Texas is placing all bets on a future classified by clean energy.

Texas becoming a clean energy leader by choosing hydrogen

Although Texas has become known for the wind farms and solar parks in the west, the state seems to be unstoppable in terms of pursuing green projects. Texas seems to have turned much of its focus towards green projects focusing on green hydrogen.

Texas is thinking larger than life in terms of its sustainable energy missions and hydrogen’s potential is being recognized. One Houston-based company is looking at constructing a 50,000 acre data center close to Laredo. This new project could very well lead to Texas being called the Data City, Texas.

Looking at bypassing the traditional grid with Data City Texas

On the cards for Texas is a data center campus of more or less 5GW that chooses to use its unique behind-the-meter power supply. By ensuring that both energy consumption and generation occurs on the same 50,000 acre property, the plan is to bypass the traditional grid completely. In the process, having energy generated, stored, and used on the same property could mean a reduction in transmission costs and in loss of energy.

However, Texas is not just looking at constructing a data center, but in creating a data center structured around sustainable and uninterupted power. The need for uniterupted power is more necessary due to the increase in artificial learning as well as machine learning.

Energy Abundance which has changed its name from Green Hydrogen International has faith in its management team who are known to have much experience in terms of behind-the-meter project engineering. The idea is for this data center to be one of the largest that is powered by a constant supply of green energy.

What the emergence of Data City could mean for Texas?

The ground-breaking project finally had its big reveal and it his clear that the Houston-based Energy Abundance Development Corporation will be behind Data City, Texas. Data City will be designed in such a way that it operates with about 5 gigawatts (GW) of power capacity. The Data City will also be developed in phases with the first phase of the 300MW facility said to come about in 2026.

Where the idea of Data City can be said to be revolutional is in terms of how operations will be powered. Initially and during the first few phases, the reliance will be on solar and wind power as well as on natural gas. Thereafter, the idea is to ensure that all operations are entirely powered by hydrogen. Hydrogen City, a green hydrogen and ammonia production site close by, will ensure solar and wind power is utilized to produce about 280,000 tons of green hydrogen every year. The question remains is green hydrogen still the future?

Data City powering the AI revolution in the process

After the initial phase in 2026, Data City is believed to be expanding to 5 gigawatts of power over 15 million square feet of space. According to Brian Maxwell, CEO and founder of Energy Abundance, America will be in the lead in the AI race having the ability to showcase green power generation that is constant. With Elon Musk also looking to dry up Texas for what has been underground for millions of years, Texas surely is becoming the hub of economic growth and futuristic innovation.

""Shutting down Revolution Wind is insane, illogical, and illegal.","Located fifteen nautical miles off the coast of Rhode Island, Revolution Wind is a wind energy facility expected to deliver enough electricity to the New England grid to power 350,000 homes, or 2.5% of the region's electricity supply beginning in 2026.

Revolution Wind is projected to save Connecticut and Rhode Island ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars over 20 years. The Revolution Wind project supports over 2,500 jobs nationwide in the construction, operations, shipbuilding and manufacturing sectors, including over 1,000 union construction jobs. The project has been vetted and approved through every layer of the federal and state regulatory process and is supported by binding contracts and legal mandates. Construction is nearly complete.

The August 22 stop work order issued by the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management (BOEM) did not identify any violation of law or imminent threat to safety. The order abstractly cites BOEM's authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), ordering the stop so that the agency may address unidentified “concerns.” No explanation was provided.

The complaint, to be filed against the Department of the Interior, BOEM and their appointed leaders alleges that such arbitrary government conduct violates both the Administrative Procedure Act and the government's authority under OCSLA.

Both laws “demand reasoned decision-making, fidelity to statutory limits, and respect for the settled expectations of sovereign States and regulated parties,” the complaint states. ""The States of Connecticut and Rhode Island sue to vindicate those principles. They seek to restore the rule of law, protect their energy and economic interests, and ensure that the federal government honors its commitments.""

The complaint asks that the court declare the stop work order unlawful and block the Trump administration from halting Revolution Wind's development.

""Revolution Wind is fully permitted, nearly complete and months from providing enough American-made, clean, affordable energy to power 350,000 homes. Now, with zero justification, Trump wants to mothball the project, send workers home, and saddle Connecticut families with millions of dollars in higher energy costs. This kind of erratic and reckless governing is blatantly illegal, and we're suing to stop it,"" said Attorney General Tong.

“With Revolution Wind, we have an opportunity to create good-paying jobs for Rhode Islanders, enhance energy reliability, and ensure energy cost savings while protecting our environment,” said Attorney General Neronha.

""It's been nearly two weeks, and the Trump Administration still has not explained or justified its decision to halt construction of Revolution Wind. While this is unacceptable, there is still a path forward if Washington is willing to be a partner. We hoped to work with the Administration to lower energy costs, strengthen grid reliability, create jobs, and drive economic growth, but only if they share those goals. But if they do not, we will act to preserve this vital project and protect the energy future of Connecticut and the entire New England region,"" said Governor Ned Lamont.

""Shutting down Revolution Wind is insane, illogical, and illegal. Thousands of workers are without jobs, businesses may close, and energy prices will only climb higher because of this foolish decision.

James Stewart is president of Unifor Local 444, representing workers at the Nextstar EV battery Plant and the Stellantis Windsor Assembly Plant. Workers in Windsor make the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid as well as the Dodge Charger Daytona.

""I understand why he's doing it, [Carney] is trying to find some relief for the industry in the short term,"" Stewart said.

I would caution in the long term, we need to make sure Canada is developing EV technology and EVs.

""Long term, we are falling behind countries like China. They're finding ways to develop their technology around EVs and, and due to that fact, lowering the cost around EVs and Canada has to make sure we're doing that. You're going to see EVs becoming part of the industry and if we fall too far behind, we're not going to be able to make the ground up.""

Carney announced the government would pause the EV mandate, which has prescribed targets for how much of an automakers' sales needs to be from EVs, for the 2026 model year and review the policy for 60 days. The 2026 target would have been 20 per cent of total sales.

The overall mandate is 100 per cent EV sales in Canada by 2035.

But automakers have lobbied against the mandate, arguing they have been hit too hard by tariffs and it would put jobs at risk.

It comes with an announcement of a whole host of other measures meant to help workers and industries hit by tariffs.

""It's not all about money, some of it is about regulation. So to add flexibility to the automotive sector, we will remove the 2026 Electric Vehicle Availability Standard, which specifies the share of new vehicle sales that must be electric next year,"" Carney said.

""This will provide immediate financial relief to automakers at a time of increased pressure on their competitiveness.""

Stewart says that EVs are here to stay, and Canada needs to be cautious about letting other countries run up a lead.

In Windsor, Stewart said his workers are well-positioned: Windsor Assembly is a multi-platform plant that builds EVs hybrids and gas engines.

""The Windsor Assembly Plant will be able to adapt to more EVs, less EVs, more top hats — whether it's a car, truck or van,"" he said. ""The plant will adjust based on the market.""

His union also represents workers at the NextStar EV battery plant. There, too, he says the company is diversifying and he's ""confident"" the facility can handle the change.

As for the other measures Carney announced, Stewart says he's cautiously optimistic but has many questions about how the supports will apply to autoworkers.

Both NextStar Energy or Stellantis declined to comment to CBC.

Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association (APMA), says automakers are applauding the move.

""Football fans know the value in a well timed and well placed punt,"" Volpe said. ""That's what this is right now.

""The pressure that this [mandate] would have put on manufacturers who have had their major market cut off in a hostile manner by the White House, looking at if this kept going up to a $3 billion in additional costs next year. I'm glad that they've removed the 2026 standard.""

He said the government remains committed to electrification, and he hopes they use this pause to speak to and listen to employers in the automotive industry.

""It's a challenge from the government to say, 'look, we're going to pause, we're going to stick to the EV tariffs that we have on China that are controversial in some spaces, but we're going to give you all the tools for you to reconfigure and build for Canada.'""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7506150.1744229744!/cantoImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/wap-tariff-last-shift.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-06 12:07:18.003554

“Utilities are committing to large loads ramping rapidly this decade,” Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge for Wood Mackenzie, said in a statement.
Data centers could consume 9% of the United States’ electricity generation by 2030 — double the amount consumed today, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.
But experts agree that not all of the proposed data centers will be built.
Investor-owned utilities have over 17 GW of large loads under construction and have committed to another 99 GW, together equal to 15.5% of current US peak demand, WoodMac said in the report.","Large loads, including AI data centers, are showing up on the U.S. electric grid and could ultimately add 20% to utilities’ peak demand, most within the next decade, according to new analysis from Wood Mackenzie published Thursday.

The report looks at investor-owned utilities’ near-term committed loads and more speculative projects beyond 2035, as well as shifts in where the demand is showing up and uncertainty around the buildout.

“Utilities are committing to large loads ramping rapidly this decade,” Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge for Wood Mackenzie, said in a statement. “The market will be hard-pressed to supply this new load on that timeframe, which may prevent it from happening.”

The need for electricity in the United States is growing rapidly, following years of flat-line demand. The growth is being driven by data centers, industrial expansion and electrification, but just how much power demand will show up remains uncertain.

Data centers could consume 9% of the United States’ electricity generation by 2030 — double the amount consumed today, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. But experts agree that not all of the proposed data centers will be built.

Investor-owned utilities have over 17 GW of large loads under construction and have committed to another 99 GW, together equal to 15.5% of current US peak demand, WoodMac said in the report. Another 32 GW of capacity “is in advanced conversation or a near-term forecast, resulting in 147 GW of high-probability load, equal to 20% of US peak demand.”

A significant portion of this capacity will come online this decade, WoodMac said, with 60 GW expected to be added through 2030 — or about 8% of current U.S. peak demand. Utilities expect 93 GW to be operational by 2035, “after which little pipeline capacity has been disclosed,” the firm said.

But how much of the longer-lead load is high-confidence capacity in utility forecasts?

“Rather than starting to see a trend toward pipeline certainty, we continue to observe the opposite,” Hertz-Shargel said.

WoodMac said its analysis shows “modest increases” in high-confidence capacity at several utilities, but the high-confidence share of the total capacity pipeline “has decreased over the last few quarters as new requests outpace the advancement and withdrawal of existing requests.”

There has also been a shift towards large load development in deregulated markets, the report found.

“While 91% of the current 17 GW of disclosed capacity under construction is located in regulated markets, 54% of committed capacity not yet under construction and 65% of capacity in advanced discussion is planned for deregulated markets,” WoodMac said.

“Committed capacity not under construction as well as advanced discussion capacity fall disproportionately in deregulated markets,” primarily in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas area, said Hertz-Shargel. “Deregulated markets pose risks of inadequate future supply and price increases to non-large load customers, which has prompted market interventions by Texas and PJM and will likely prompt more in the future.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hIdsAudTEAQ30lovdVYmOOsNwxVlhWu7zfHQLuo6vbY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzQwNTY3MTQ4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-06 12:06:20.754080

We recognize that,” said the prime minister, who confirmed he is beginning an immediate 60-day review of the EVAS.
“The EV Availability Standard remains essential for ensuring predictability and supporting investments across the broader EV ecosystem.” The Pembina Institute also weighed in on the changes to EV policy.
“The federal government’s decision to pause — rather than adjust — the EV Availability Standard leans too heavily toward the concerns of the automotive industry, not the best interest of Canadians.
“We’ll look at the interaction between the EV mandate, our clean fuel standards, our investment tax credits, our trade policy — all of those elements.","The federal government plans to review the Electric Vehicle Availability Standard in the face of mounting economic and trade pressures

This week Prime Minister Mark Carney unveiled a series of actionable priorities to support sectors of Canada’s economy struggling in the face of U.S. tariffs — including the automotive industry.

Among the long list of issues addressed was the government’s role in encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles and, specifically, a promise that Canadian automakers and dealerships will not be forced to meet the 2026 Electric Vehicle Availability Standard (EVAS).

“We have an auto sector which, because of the massive change in U.S. policy, is under extreme pressure. We recognize that,” said the prime minister, who confirmed he is beginning an immediate 60-day review of the EVAS.

“They’ve got enough on their plate right now, so we’re taking that off.”

The EVAS regulations (originally set by the previous incarnation of the liberal government) state that for 2026, at least 20 per cent of new light-duty vehicle sales in Canada be zero emissions vehicles. Those percentages were slated to rise to 60 per cent by 2030 before finally reaching 100 per cent of all new light-duty vehicle sales by 2035.

According to a government statement, the purpose of the review is to ensure the EVAS framework “continues to reflect market realities, remains effective for Canadians, and does not place undue burden on automakers. The review will consider potential amendments to the annual sales targets, including the 2035 goal, and will explore possible additional flexibilities.”

Industry response

Responses to the announced EV policy change were quick to come and range from fully supportive to disappointed.

Ontario mayors representing cities where automotive manufacturing occurs, dubbed “Auto Mayors,” expressed strong support for government’s revised approach to EVs.

“The decision to waive the 2026 model year vehicles from the Electric Vehicle Availability Standard, combined with an immediate 60-day review of the EV Standard is the essential course correction needed to prevent the loss of the Canadian auto industry,” the Auto Mayors wrote in a statement.

The Canadian Automotive Dealer’s Association also came out in favour of the plans and said it would engage with the federal government during the 60-day review period.

“It gives certainty to consumers and the automotive industry for the next year, and will help to avoid a consumer availability and affordability crisis in the short term. The provinces of Quebec and British Columbia should immediately follow this lead to avoid perpetuating internal trade barriers,” the association wrote in a statement.

Meanwhile the Canadian Charging Infrastructure Council (CCIC), which represents the businesses that manage half of the public charging sites in Canada, issued a statement emphasizing the importance of maintaining the EVAS.

CCIC’s president, Travis Allan, wrote, “The EVAS plays a critical role in supporting the multi-year investments in charging infrastructure and utility upgrades needed by future Canadian EV drivers. These investments create sustainable, well-paying jobs in civil and electrical trades across Canada.”

The council urged the federal government to “keep [EVAS] targets ambitious and to provide long-term policy certainty that attracts private investment.”

National industry association, Electric Mobility Canada (EMC), says the way EVAS is currently structured offers sufficient flexibility to accommodate for changed U.S. trade policy and what is needed now is government to throw its support behind EV adoption.

“While Canada is providing the industry temporary relief from regulatory compliance, Electric Mobility Canada urges the government to swiftly confirm a clear path forward,” reads a statement from EMC president and CEO, Daniel Breton.

“The EV Availability Standard remains essential for ensuring predictability and supporting investments across the broader EV ecosystem.”

The Pembina Institute also weighed in on the changes to EV policy. The director of its transportation program, Adam Thorn, shared his thoughts in a statement.

“The federal government’s decision to pause — rather than adjust — the EV Availability Standard leans too heavily toward the concerns of the automotive industry, not the best interest of Canadians. It also unfairly penalizes companies that have already made investments in EV production and infrastructure based on an expectation of clear, consistent policy.”

Thorn suggests that the government look at other options including: “extending credits for plug-in hybrid vehicle and charging infrastructure, modestly adjusting targets, or re-evaluating tariffs on Chinese-made EVs.”

Next steps

The government’s 60 day review period of EVAS will no doubt include hearing feedback from industry stakeholders as they lobby the government in the hopes of informing the path forward.

“We are using this as an opportunity, as part of a broader strategy on climate competitiveness, to look at all our measures to help get greenhouse gases down in the key sectors,” said Carney.

“We’ll look at the interaction between the EV mandate, our clean fuel standards, our investment tax credits, our trade policy — all of those elements. What this government is focussed on is absolutely results.”

What exactly those “results” are is still unclear, but Carney did pledge that as part of the review, “we’ll advance new options to bring more — and more affordable — electric vehicles to Canadians.”",https://cms.electricautonomy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Canada-EV-mandate-hero.jpeg,N,,2025-09-06 07:59:37.364386

CHESTER, Pa.—In this small city south of Philadelphia, trash is a problem. A thick white cloud rising from Reworld’s Delaware Valley Resource Recovery Facility, the largest trash incinerator in the country by capacity, and the stinging odor of garbage are daily reminders that mounds of waste from Philadelphia, New York City and Delaware are a toxic burden here.

Air pollution from the burning trash and emissions from other industrial sites along the river have long been blamed for contributing to high rates of deadly illnesses in Chester and the surrounding Delaware County. Beginning in 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency noted the harmful load of industrial facilities in the city.

Now, researchers and community groups are raising alarms that Chester and its neighboring towns could face a new liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal that will increase emissions and pollution and add a potential threat of explosions.

Their concern comes amid a push by the Trump administration to dramatically increase LNG exports, which could contribute an estimated $1.3 trillion dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product through 2040. Pennsylvania lawmakers speak of the financial benefits of a terminal along the Delaware River—they predict thousands of new jobs—but people who live in the region are most interested and worried about the quality of the air they breathe.

LNG is a form of natural gas cooled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit. In Pennsylvania, the nation’s second largest energy-producing state, the gas comes primarily from fracking the Marcellus Shale, which runs beneath about two-thirds to three-quarters of the state.

The condensed fuel is shipped to international markets, which has bolstered the national economy in recent years. But a recent Inside Climate News analysis has found that those exports, and specifically the tankers that transport LNG from the United States, contribute to global warming through the emission of methane, a climate super-pollutant 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.

For the community activists facing a new LNG export terminal, the risks of the tanker traffic and possible pipeline accidents far outweigh the benefits. “It’s the potential of death,” said David Kronheim. The retired computer programmer has lived in Chester for five years, about a mile from the incinerator. If an LNG export terminal were built nearby, Kronheim said he would want to move. “It doesn’t matter where they build it. If you’re within 10 miles you’re in trouble,” said Kronheim, who has joined a local activist group that is fighting the terminal.

In 2016, a New York based company, Penn America Energy, wrote a report on the economic impact of building a $6.4 billion dollar facility that would operate out of Chester in 2023. CEO Franc James held meetings with local lawmakers but faced local pressure against allowing another polluting industry into an overburdened community and obstacles from the Biden administration to slow LNG exports.

That changed on Jan. 20 as President Trump signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency. LNG exports have become a focus of foreign policy and energy development.

In April, Pennsylvania Republican Sen. David McCormick announced in a Washington Times op-ed that Penn America was collaborating with the Pennsylvania Building Trades, a union alliance, on a $7 billion LNG export terminal in Eddystone Borough, a working class white community next to Chester along the I-95 corridor south of Philadelphia.

That terminal, he said, would contribute to future “energy domination” and “that future runs through Pennsylvania.”

“This massive, proposed project in southeastern Pennsylvania has the potential to generate billions in economic impact over the next 20 years, create 3,000 good-paying jobs, and produce $30-$40 million per year in tax revenue for this community,” McCormick said in a separate statement on his Senate website that criticized Biden’s efforts to evaluate environmental and economic impacts of LNG exports.

“The Biden Administration foolishly placed an indefinite pause on this and other critical projects, halting our progress towards energy independence…I’m grateful to President Trump for immediately reversing this ban, allowing proposals like this new LNG export terminal to resume and unleashing Pennsylvania’s energy dominance,” McCormick said.

In June, Reuters reported that James, the Penn America Energy executive, had a meeting in the White House to “provide intelligence” on bringing LNG operations to southeast Pennsylvania. James told Reuters he was looking beyond the original Chester location to other possible sites in Trainer, Marcus Hook and Eddystone.

Last month, Trump signed a record agreement with the European Union to buy $750 billion dollars worth of American energy in the next three years—an amount that some experts warn is unrealistic.

Activists in Delaware County have said that McCormick’s optimistic estimates for job creation and tax revenues clash with on-the-ground realities: potential public health harm from what could be a 100-acre site in a residential area.

Chester and Eddystone are part of what advocates have identified as an environmental justice area, where low-income neighborhoods and communities of color have been disproportionately harmed by polluting industries for decades.

Zulene Mayfield, an activist who heads the nonprofit Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living (CRCQL), has been at the forefront of the environmental justice movement in Chester since 1992.

When she hears talk of a potential economic boom in the area, Mayfield said she can’t help but take the word literally, thinking of a 2022 explosion at an LNG site in Freeport, Texas, that stemmed from a pipe failure. Vapors ignited a fireball. Damage was contained to the site, and there were no injuries reported to authorities, according to a government website.

She noted that the potential exists for liquified natural gas to combust and CRCQL is concerned about an explosion risk in Delaware County, a densely populated area. Two local hospitals closed in the past year, and Mayfield said that undercut the community’s ability to handle medical crises.

“The difference now is that they’ve ripped away the protections,” she said referring to EPA regulations. “And there have never been that many in the first place.”

Following Trump’s executive order, the U.S. Department of Energy announced in January that it was lifting Biden’s 2024 pause on LNG exports. In March, the EPA announced 31 regulatory rollbacks that it called ”the biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history” to encourage energy production.

“We know there’s no help from the EPA,” Mayfield said. “Don’t think the cavalry is coming from Washington. It is incumbent on us to become our own cavalry.”

The Delaware Riverkeeper Network, a nonprofit that aims to protect waterways, has submitted right-to-know requests to Eddystone Borough to sort through documentation or filings related to efforts to build the export terminal. Following Sen. McCormick’s op-ed that raised Eddystone as a possible site, the borough manager for code compliance in May emailed a response to the Riverkeepers that said: “There is nothing to report as I do not know what you are referring to.”

Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, said she is concerned that Penn America Energy has been informally lining up support with elected representatives from the state.

Eddystone and Chester are communities directly next to each other on the Delaware River. Chester takes up six square miles, Eddystone accounts for less than two square miles. Activists say that neither are large enough to safely accommodate the industry, and there isn’t a site to build in either location that wouldn’t infringe on homes, small businesses, churches, or major throughways.

“They would have to go in and destroy the community,” Mayfield said, referring to Eddystone. “[An LNG terminal] is way too large for a populated area like this.”

Mayfield said she is just as worried about LNG in Eddystone as she was about Chester.

Comparing the situation to a house on fire,she said that the threat was the same, regardless of which town in Delaware County that investors had their sights on. “If they go to Eddystone, that’s the equivalent of a neighbor’s house on fire,” she said. “If their house is on fire, our house is going to burn, too.”

Turning their efforts to resisting plans for LNG in Eddystone, Mayfield and Carluccio are leading an education and mobilization campaign across Delaware County with public and virtual forums. Researchers from Haverford College have joined to explain how the LNG terminal would affect the county, beyond economic terms.

“They want us dumb,” said Mayfield at a public forum that CRCQL sponsored last month. “They don’t want educated thinkers. They want workers—bargain basement thinkers who won’t challenge them.”

A crowd of about 30 residents, community organizers and researchers sat on wooden pews one hot summer day at the Quaker Providence Friends Meeting House in Media, about six miles north of Chester, to learn how LNG’s promise for economic development could affect their health.

Mayfield and Carluccio said residents in the affluent area near Chester should care about the LNG terminal. “The fight is getting those who don’t see and smell it [to understand] that you are in just as much danger,” Mayfield said.

Residents living in towns not directly burdened by the industries that pollute Chester might not be aware of the dangerous air emissions that waft inland from the waterfront, she said.

Chester, a predominantly Black community, is burdened by a disproportionate amount of polluting industries, which fits a larger trend of systemic racial bias, along with lower socioeconomic status, as a defining factor of where these industries are historically located. A General Accounting Office study in the 1980s found 75 percent of hazardous waste sites across eight states were in low-income communities of color.

Mayfield pointed out that what happens in Chester now will affect nearby communities. Majority white suburbs will be affected by the LNG terminal’s traffic and air pollution, she said. Harm won’t be contained to just one zip code.

Lauren Minsky, a health studies professor at Haverford College who spoke during the meeting, said her research on cancer in Delaware County found industries on the river had contributed to pollution that correlates with a range of heightened rates of deadly diseases in southeast Pennsylvania.

Minsky presented a map during the meeting that tracked weather patterns and showed how wind moves northwest and inland from the waterfront. Towns farther from the river, including Media, would be affected, and the air from the waterfront was shown to be laden with particulate matter and carcinogens, she said.

“You can think of [it] as a sacrifice zone where people are losing their lives because of these facilities,” Minsky said. ““People in these communities are dying young.”

“It’s not always routine, it’s not only where you work, it’s not only your lifestyle, it can be the land and the air where you live that affects you,” Mayfield said about the causes of cancer and asthma in Delaware County. “Our children literally cannot breathe.”

Children in Eddystone developed Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, a blood cancer, at a rate 1,051 percent higher than the national average, according to Minsky’s research. Meanwhile in Chester City, female rates of laryngeal cancer were 201 percent higher than the national average, and male rates of liver and bile cancer were 97 percent higher than the national average, her research found.

A study published in May by Johns Hopkins researchers focused on Chester and surrounding boroughs in an effort to better account for and assess the noncarcinogenic health eﬀects of cumulative chemical exposures. The researchers found that the mix of pollutants from the various industries posed more health risks to nearby communities–called “fenceline communities” in the study–than the harm associated with a single pollutant.

The Johns Hopkins team noted that “communities along the Delaware River in southeastern Pennsylvania have long faced high levels of pollution from petro-chemical reﬁneries, municipal waste incinerators, and several other industrial facilities.” The EPA had for years documented elevated rates of infant mortality, cancer mortality, and asthma among residents.

Other groups that attended Mayfield’s meeting included Swarthmore College’s Campus Coalition Concerning Chester, Earth Quaker Action Team, and Choices, a youth environmental justice group affiliated with CRCQL.

While CRCQL has been spreading the word of environmental justice and rallying support against LNG proposals this summer through public meetings, Choices has been doing its own advocacy. Its members are between 8 and 18 years old.

Their work has included testing soil samples for lead with University of Pennsylvania researchers, volunteering at a local farm, building solar panels, and events to support and inspire the community.

Nolan Fontaine, who has an Ed.D. in sociology, equity studies and education, is an American Indian organizer who also leads Choices. Modern day Chester is located in the Okehocking and Lenapehocken region, and Fontaine’s activism includes reclaiming his familial roots along the Delaware River. He said Choices aims to change the narrative about industries that came to the city promising jobs and left residents fighting for air.

Hope and love for the community, he said, is intertwined with the resistance to the trash incinerator and polluting sites along the river. It’s evident in Choices initiatives including, “Sowing Seeds of Hope,” a gardening event and plant giveaway.

“It’s a small act of resistance. While we aren’t able to shut down Reworld Covanta yet,” Fontaine said of Chester’s trash incinerator, “we can control our homes and our small environments to make them cleaner, fresher, and a safe place for us to be able to breathe.”",https://delawarecurrents.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/chester-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:06:29.869149

Canada’s auto sector is highly integrated with the US and is facing significant impacts from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
“I just spent three months looking at hybrids and EVs,” Van Nijnatten said.","“The Liberals keep retreating in the face of populist conservative rhetoric that targets some aspects of climate policy,” Van Nijnatten said.

As one of his first acts as Prime Minister, Carney ended the consumer carbon price — and Van Nijnatten places Carney’s pausing of the EV sales mandate on the same throughline.

“All this does is make me think … he's going to lift the oil and gas [emissions] cap as well,” she said.

Bloc Québécois environment and climate change critic Patrick Bonin slammed Carney’s decision in an emailed statement.

""By once again bowing to pressure from the lobby of Ontario automakers and western oil companies, the federal government is weakening our environment and the availability of electric vehicles, all at the expense of Quebecers,” Bonin said in the statement, released in French.

“Once again, we see that when it comes to fighting climate change, Mark Carney has only one gear: backward.""

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who has been calling for the mandate to be scrapped, called the delay a “clumsy retreat” that adds uncertainty for investors in the auto sector. The NDP did not respond to a request for comment.

The transportation sector is responsible for 23 per cent of Canada’s emissions, second only to the oil and gas sector’s 30 per cent share. From 1990 to 2023, emissions from cars have fallen while emissions from light trucks (including SUVs) more than doubled.

Oil and gas and transportation are the highest emitting economic sectors and should be responsible for a fair share of emissions reductions but pausing the sales mandate gives the transport sector a break, Van Nijnatten said. The electricity sector is doing some heavy lifting to reduce emissions and emissions from the heavy industry sector are also falling.

With Chinese and European carmakers surging forward with EVs, Van Nijnatten fears pausing the mandate will only add to the gap in North American competitiveness while limiting choice for consumers.

North American automakers “will not choose to do it on their own, because, first of all, they're protected by tariff walls and, second of all, they're protected by policy and politics,” she said.

Keith Brooks, programs director at Environmental Defence, said “healthy competition” is needed to balance supporting Canada’s auto sector while offering consumers choices and reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

“If we bring Chinese EVs in, and we create a more competitive market, that's good, because the domestic automakers here in North America would just rather not do EVs,” Brooks said in an Aug. 14 phone interview with Canada’s National Observer.

“If they're not being pushed to [build EVs], either by regulation or competition, we're not going to get them.”

Removing the first sales target is a “direct disincentive” for automakers to make electric vehicles available to Canadians, Van Nijnatten said.

The auto sector holds considerable power — particularly in Ontario — and many auto sector groups and companies have long opposed the federal government’s regulations, which require hybrids and EVs to make up “at least” 20 per cent of sales in 2026 and 100 per cent by 2035. Canada’s auto sector is highly integrated with the US and is facing significant impacts from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. A common refrain from companies and industry associations is that the sales targets are unrealistic.

The regulations operate with a credit system for flexibility so companies that perform better than their ZEV targets earn credits which they can bank or sell to other companies who are underperforming. ZEV sales from 2024 and 2025 also count towards the credits, offering further flexibility, Daniel Breton, head of Electric Mobility Canada, said in a phone interview with Canada’s National Observer on Aug. 14.

Companies — and Conservative politicians such as Pierre Poilievre — also say the sales mandate will limit consumer choice.

Van Nijnatten said, as a consumer, her choices are already being restricted and removing the sales target will only exacerbate the problem.

“I just spent three months looking at hybrids and EVs,” Van Nijnatten said. “Do you think I can buy one off a lot anywhere?” Her answer: no.

Risk to profits

The Detroit Three auto manufacturers (Ford, GM and Stellantis) met with Carney in June and called on him to scrap the EV mandate.

In corporate filings, the auto manufacturers say that the transition to electric vehicles poses risks to the companies’ profits.

“Ford’s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States,” the company disclosed to shareholders. “A shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles with internal combustion engines (including trucks and utilities) to electric or other vehicles in our portfolio that may be less profitable could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.”

Some stakeholders are more optimistic about the 60-day review. It is an opportunity for the federal government to marry EV sector policy with its made-in-Canada industrial development goals, Matthew Fortier, president and CEO of Accelerate, said in an emailed statement to Canada’s National Observer.

“We want more Canadians driving EVs but we also want more Canada in those EVs, including critical minerals, batteries and other components,” Fortier said. “I think there are ways to use policies designed to drive purchase uptake to also incentivize manufacturer investment into our supply chain.”

In Mississauga, Carney said his government “will advance new options to bring more affordable electric vehicles to Canadians” but did not say how. Last fall, the federal government imposed a 100 per cent tariff on cheaper, Chinese-made EVs, which prompted China to impose retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola imports. Lifting that tariff would increase the availability and affordability of EVs.

In a press conference last week, Housing Minister Gregor Robertson (speaking for Energy Minister Tim Hodgson) said Canada will not be dropping its tariff on Chinese EVs in order to protect workers at Canadian automakers.

When asked on Friday if the federal government will consider lifting the tariff on China’s EVs, Carney said, “We have begun more intense engagement with China with respect, first and foremost, to canola and other agriculture and seafood products … I'm sure those discussions will branch out, but it's too early to come to any conclusions on those.”

The government also intends to strengthen federal tax credits to “foster investment in clean energy” and keep the industrial carbon price but noted a need to “improve” the way the carbon market works, Carney said Friday, speaking in French. There will be a policy for “carbon competitiveness” and nature, he said.

“We intend to do a lot but we're focusing really on results, and the results are to improve the competitiveness of our economy, our businesses, as it pertains to the reduction in greenhouse gasses.”

Van Nijnatten said maybe Carney will “pull a rabbit out a hat” with his forthcoming climate strategy, but these initiatives don’t show much promise.

“Anything you do that dances around direct emission reductions delays the transition,” she said. “It will make it more costly in the long run. It places industries at a competitive disadvantage over the long run and … it's not going to contribute to our 2030 emissions reduction plan.”

Sandor Hollo, former Chief Technology Officer of GE Energy Storage, joins as EVP of Product; Alison Armstrong, former manufacturing director from Tesla, joins as Head of Operations; and Dilip Goswami, former CEO of Molekule and venture partner at At One Ventures, joins as President. The new leadership appointments mark a pivotal moment for Inlyte Energy as it transitions from technology development to commercial-scale production.

""Inlyte is at an inflection point. We've proven that our iron-sodium technology is ready for grid-scale storage, and now is the moment to scale,"" said Antonio Baclig, CEO of Inlyte Energy. ""Sandor, Alison, and Dilip have unmatched experience building and commercializing new technology, and I'm confident their experience will help transform Inlyte into a world-class manufacturing organization that pushes forward American leadership in energy storage.""

As the CTO for GE's Energy Storage division, Hollo built a global engineering organization of 120+ employees and oversaw the scale-up of GE's Durathon™ battery plant in Schenectady, New York. The factory produced a sodium-nickel battery based on a similar sodium metal chloride (NaMX) chemistry as Inlyte's iron-sodium battery, and Hollo will bring his decades of experience with the technology to optimize Inlyte's products for the stationary storage market. Most recently, Hollo served as the Chief Engineer at REFIRE, a leading fuel cell and electrolyzer manufacturer. ""Having spent over a decade commercializing sodium metal chloride batteries, I can say with confidence that what Inlyte has accomplished is a real leap forward,"" said Hollo. ""Inlyte's iron-sodium battery is technically mature, the supply chain is secure, and the company is ready to meet the needs of today's grid.""

Armstrong joins following a distinguished career in manufacturing across Ford Motor Company, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, Tesla, and Zero Motorcycles. At Tesla, Armstrong led a team of 1,800 employees manufacturing powertrain products for the Model X and Model S, and she brings her experience in scaling high-volume, cost-effective manufacturing in the United States to Inlyte. Armstrong also served as the VP of Manufacturing and Programs at Zero Motorcycles, where she doubled the company's manufacturing footprint in California to grow battery and motor production. ""In my experience, high-volume manufacturing is one of the hardest transitions for startups,"" said Armstrong. ""I'm excited to bring my experience scaling domestic manufacturing to deliver resilient, affordable energy storage to our customers.""

Goswami co-founded Molekule and led the company as the CEO, President, and CTO to $100M+ in revenue, $100M+ in successive fundraises and a public listing through a merger with AeroClean Technologies. Goswami's decision to join the leadership team follows his term as a Venture Partner at At One Ventures, where he led the firm's initial investment in Inlyte Energy. Goswami will lead Inlyte's finance and strategy to position the company for its next phase of growth. ""Inlyte has a unique position of innovative but proven technology, unbeatable cost, and surging customer interest,"" said Goswami. ""Now it's time to execute on our vision for large scale, safe, cost-effective energy storage.""

These hires come as Inlyte has announced its first utility-scale BESS project with Southern Company and a Department of Energy-backed commercial-scale project in a fire-risk zone in Northern California this year. The team will be attending the RE+ Conference in Las Vegas, NV next week to build commercial partnerships for Inlyte's first US factory.

Source: DOT, IRS EV STATS IN HAWAII >> Hawaii has 38,086 registered passengers EVs.","For electric vehicle drivers in Hawaii, there will soon be few, if any, perks left — as some of the most popular ones are set to expire this month.

Solo drivers with EV license plates have since 2012 been permitted to use the high-occupancy vehicle lane on Oahu highways, which are usually reserved for cars with at least two occupants during rush hour to encourage carpooling.

On Sept. 30, a federal code allowing states to set their own HOV lane requirements expires, and federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of EV vehicles also end.

These changes come at a time when Hawaii is being held accountable for its ambitious, state-mandated goals of achieving 100% clean energy and net-zero emissions by 2045, and are expected to hamper efforts to get more residents to drive electric in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“It definitely doesn’t help,” said state Rep. Nicole Lowen, chair of the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee. “Taking incentives away isn’t pushing things in the right direction.”

Still, she thinks most of the impetus behind EV adoption has been market­ driven.

The HOV lane perk may have been an incentive for some drivers commuting on the H-1 freeway to go electric, but even without it, EVs remain a competitive choice for consumers, she said, because they cost less to own and operate in the long run.

There are fewer maintenance costs, such as a regular oil changes, and no more waiting in line at the gas station.

“From a consumer point of view, there’s still a really strong case for it,” she said. “I think we’ll continue to see people buying EVs.”

History of perks

In an effort to boost the adoption of EVs, Hawaii passed a law in 2012 that offered a smorgasbord of perks.

EVs were not only allowed to use the HOV lane with only one occupant, but granted free parking at street parking meters, in state and county parking lots, and at airport parking lots.

Those privileges sunsetted on July 1, 2020, but the state Department of Transportation extended the HOV perk for EV drivers.

DOT says it is complying with federal law come Sept. 30, but will retain language written into Hawaii’s administration rules should states be able to make their own rules once again.

Additionally, car consumers will no longer be eligible for a $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of new EVs as a result of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” adopted in July. Hawaii does not offer tax credits or rebates for the purchase of EVs.

The Electric Vehicle Association called the rollback of incentives a step in the wrong direction and “a lane change we can’t afford to make.”

EVA board member Elaine Borseth called the HOV lane perk “one of the simplest, most effective ways to encourage clean transportation,” and said it’s still necessary, given that EV adoption is still in a critical growth phase.

“We’re on our way, but we’re not there yet,” she said in a recent blog post. “Removing low-cost, high-impact incentives like HOV access risks slowing the momentum just when we need it most.”

EVs on the rise

Noel Morin, president of the Hawaii EV Association, said it is unfortunate to see these barriers to adoption, especially as sales are gaining momentum in the state.

The perks and tax incentives appear to have spurred the growth of EVs in Hawaii, with year-over-year increases over the past five years.

In July 2021 there were 15,551 registered EVs in Hawaii, which more than doubled to nearly 33,000 by July 2024. As of July this year, the state counted 38,086 registered EVs in Hawaii, a 16% increase from 2024.

EVs now represent 3.5% of the more than 1 million registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“If you look at the trajectory, more people are adopting EVs,” Morin said. “As people upgrade, and rental car companies dispense of EVs, it also means you have a pre-owned market.”

The range of EV batteries has improved, and there are an expanding number of EV options to choose from in the U.S., including ones that start at lower price points from brands such as Nissan, Chevrolet and Hyundai.

Locally, the expanding pre-owned EV market also offers consumers more affordable EV choices.

The addition of tariffs and Matson’s recent announcement that it will no longer ship EVs to Hawaii complicate the market outlook, but the days in which EVs were considered a rarity in Hawaii are over.

The Tesla Model Y, despite a drop in sales, is the third-most-popular vehicle in the state, according to Hawaii Auto Outlook, two notches below the Toyota Tacoma, which has long taken the top spot.

Hawaii also has been recognized as a top state in the U.S. for EV adoption.

J.D. Power last year ranked Hawaii third, behind California and Washington, in EV adoption based on an index weighing consumer preferences and availability. Hawaii was also among the top five EV markets, with EVs making up nearly 12% of new vehicle sales in the state.

Achieving EV equity

“We see an increase in EV registrations, so it’s steadily heading in the right direction, but obviously, not fast enough,” said Jeff Mikulina of Climate Hawaii. “The timing is very unfortunate for these new changes.”

While perks help get people in the door, he said, Hawaii needs a clean transportation program that works for everyone.

“So I think it’s on the state, now, particularly with this Navahine settlement, to really focus on equity and infrastructure, and making those take center stage,” he said.

That means making EVs more accessible for families, renters, and rural communities, he said, and investing in more charging stations, particularly for multifamily units — and doing everything possible to make clean transportation “the default as opposed to a luxury.”

DOT released a 205-page draft of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of a settlement of a lawsuit – Navahine vs. DOT — filed by a group of young climate activists.

Public comments on the draft were due by the end of Sunday.

As a legislator, Lowen has introduced bills seeking to expand EV charging infrastructure, including one offering rebates for EV-ready parking stalls in new affordable housing developments.

Morin agreed much more needs to be done to accelerate the adoption of EVs in the state if Hawaii is to reach its clean-energy goals.

Hawaii consumes nearly 40 million gallons of gasoline and diesel each month, and gas and diesel vehicles still make up 93% of all registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“It’s not just about EVs,” Morin said. “It’s about sustainable transportation. It’s about efficient transportation.”

That includes expanding other options like public transit, biking, walking, and rideshares.

“We want to be independent of fossil fuel imports,” Morin said. “We don’t want to be dependent on ships coming in to turn on our lights, transport our kids, or do our jobs. One way to do that is to achieve these goals.”

While it’s going to “take a little longer to make it happen,” he said, it doesn’t change the urgency of those aspirations.

Education is still a part of it, and Hawaii EV is hosting events locally from Sept. 12 to Oct. 12 to raise awareness on the numerous benefits of electric cars, trucks, and motorcycles as part of National Drive Electric Month.

Mikulina said the timing of the federal cutbacks is unfortunate, but is nevertheless confident that market demand for EVs will not go away, as global trends show the future is electric.

“Really, I think the momentum is so strong to electrify transportation and for clean energy,” said Mikulina, “that this is this is just a speed hump.”

CHANGES AFOOT FOR EV DRIVERS

>> On Sept. 30, the right to use the HOV lane during rush hour by solo EV drivers ends.

>> Where are HOV lanes? Oahu, the most populated isle in Hawaii, is home to most HOV lanes, which are available on the H-1 highway weekday mornings, as well as on H-2, Nimitz, Moanalua, and Kalanianaole highways.

>> On Sept. 30, federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible new EVs, and up to $4,000 for used EVs expires. These tax credits were originally set to last through Dec. 31, 2032, under the Inflation Reduction Act.

>> What to know: The IRS says a contract signed or down payment made for an EV before Sept. 30 is still eligible, even if the car is delivered at a later time. The vehicle must be acquired with a written binding contract before Sept. 30.

>> Starting in July, Hawaii EV owners could choose between paying a per-mile road usage charge of $8 per 1,000 miles, capped at $50, or annual fee of $50 (replacing the $50 EV surcharge). In 2028, all EV owners must pay the per-mile usage charge.

The EV transition is disrupting trillions of dollars of annual cash flows, and not just in the oil industry. People who stand to lose in that transition are working hard to delay the change, primarily by spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).The recently passed Federal budget bill adds two new sources of uncertainty, by eliminating the electric vehicle tax credits, and by attempting to renege on previous commitments to fund EV charging infrastructure. Like most political footballs, the impacts of these will probably be neither as good nor as bad as the opposing parties claim, but the fear, uncertainty and doubt are themselves a big problem.

FUD creates inertia, causing people who might otherwise care deeply about the benefits of BEVs and PHEVs to buy ""just one more"" vehicle that can't be plugged in. And that, in turn, locks in the status quo for 30 more years, at least for that one vehicle. A little reflection is in order.First, it's unconscionable that the administration that brought us DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) should threaten to rescind funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) charger installations on the claimed basis of the pace of the buildout. That pace was dictated by the accountability protocols of the bipartisan infrastructure bill that authorized NEVI.

But EV opponents have never lacked for hypocrisy, and there are plenty of public EV chargers already in place, with many more on the way. If you look on plugshare.com, you'll see that you can already drive an EV anywhere in the U.S. with little or no inconvenience, as long as you do your homework.Second, not all EVs are eligible for tax credits today. There are strict limits relating to price, where the battery materials come from, and where the vehicles are built. Manufacturers and dealers price their vehicles to match whatever the market will bear, and use a host of tricks (rebates, lease terms, trade-in values, monthly payments, etc.) to disguise the real price. The prices they accept, dictated by market realities, are quite flexible, even if they are highly inscrutable. But currently ineligible vehicles are unlikely to see major price changes when their competitors lose their tax advantage, and previously eligible vehicles will still have to compete.Third, the competition is heating up, with more electric vehicle models on the market every day. U.S. politics may be highly dysfunctional, but the rest of the world recognizes the value of electrification, and isn't sitting still. Putin's war on Ukraine lit a fire under Europe for energy security, leading to major increases in EV market share in most European countries. In Norway, long a leader, over 95 percent of new cars sold are now electric. The Chinese government made a command decision to go electric over 35 years ago, for similar reasons. We'll see how long Congress continues to abdicate its responsibility for tariffs and other taxation, but the impact of those foreign EVs is coming to the United States, even if the cars themselves are somehow kept out.Finally, if you remain convinced that the sky is falling, you can buy an EV and still get the tax credit (up to $7,500 for new EVs, and up to $4,000 for used) until Sept. 30. It's available as an instant rebate when you buy the car. You just have to sign one form at the dealer, and include another one with your tax return next April.There are many other bogus narratives (about charging, price, size, environmental issues, and more) out there. But a quick look at a few real EVs and a short talk with a few real EV drivers can easily dispel the lies and clear up the FUD. National Drive Electric Month (NDEM) exists to provide those opportunities. The Blue Ridge EV Club will hold its 12th annual NDEM event on Sunday, Sept. 14th at the Tanger Asheville Outlets Mall on Brevard Road. For more information, see driveelectricmonth.org.

Designing suitable facet and lattice for perovskites can enhance the performance of PSCs. Utilization of suitable additive can afford the growth of perovskite with suitable facet, and that can enhance the performance of PSCs. Ma et al.75 have demonstrated facet-dependent degradation and facet engineering to achieve stable PSCs. The FAPbI3 with the dominant (100) facet exhibits much higher degradation for moisture when compared to the FAPbI3 with the dominant (111) facet. The key mechanisms of facet-dependent degradation of FAPbI3 films are provided based on theoretical and experimental studies. An elongated Pb−I bond distance is formed due to the strong water adhesion on the FAPbI3 with the dominant (100) facet, and thus a new δ-phase is formed on the (100) facet, which is attributed to the poor stability of the dominant (100) facet. Therefore, a larger surface fraction of the (111) facet is prepared by utilizing cyclohexylamine (boiling point: 134 °C) as an additive to selectively prefer the growth of the (111) facet, and the FAPbI3 with the dominated (111) facet exhibits much higher stability against moisture. The Fig. 2a depicts the XRD pattern of the FAPbI3 with the cyclohexylamine additive, where the FAPbI3 exhibits peaks for both (111) and (100) facets, but the dominant peak is for the (111) facet. A large triangular (111) facet on the individual crystal with fewer lateral (100) facets is observed from the FAPbI3 with cyclohexylamine additive, as shown in Fig. 2b (SEM image), which is contrast to the SEM image of the FAPbI3 with the dominant (100) facet (without additive). The XRD pattern of FAPbI3 with the dominant (111) facet corroborates with the SEM image (the large triangular (111) facet). The exposed-area percentage of the (111) facets from five crystals of the FAPbI3 with and without cyclohexylamine additive is approximately calculated using larger-area SEM images, where the FAPbI3 with cyclohexylamine additive exhibits 85–98% (Fig. 2c) for the (111) facets when compared to that of the control (40–55%). Hence, the FAPbI3 with cyclohexylamine additive exhibits a predominant enlarged (111) facet by diminishing the moisture-sensitive (100) facet, which could be attributed to the selective absorption of the cyclohexylamine additive, and that can diminish the surface energy of the (111) facet. The moisture stability of the FAPbI3 with the cyclohexylamine additive is compared with that of the FAPbI3 without the additive after exposure to 30–40% relative humidity in the air. In the XRD spectra, the FAPbI3 with cyclohexylamine additive exhibits negligible reduction of both (100) peak and dominant (111) peak intensities after exposure for ∼1000 h in moisture (green line; Fig. 2d, top) when compared to that of the unexposed film (black dashed line), which is corroborated with the PL spectra (Fig. 2e, top; a slight peak shift is observed after exposure), where the slight peak shift can be attributed to the phase segregation of FA. Nevertheless, in the XRD spectra, the FAPbI3 without additive exhibits an obvious reduction (~30%) in the dominant (100) peak intensity after exposure for ∼1000 h in moisture (green line; Fig. 2d, bottom) when compared to that of the unexposed film (black dashed line), while a new obvious peak for δ-phase is observed after exposure, which is corroborated with the PL spectra (Fig. 2e, bottom; the obvious reduction in the peak intensity is observed after exposure), which is attributed to the generation of non-radiative recombination centers possibly due to the formation of δ-phase on the (100) facet. Hence, the PSC (FAPbI3 with the dominant (111) facet) exhibits exceptional PCE of 24% (Table 2), with high stability (95% retention for ∼2000 h (Fig. 2f) at 30–40% relative humidity for the device without encapsulation).

The utilization of topochemical assembly strategy can afford the growth of perovskite with suitable orientation, and that can diminish lattice heterogeneity, electronic disorder, and microstructure defects, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Zhu et al.116 have demonstrated that the lattice heterogeneity is minimized by topochemical assembly in polycrystalline halide perovskites to enhance the stability of the PSCs. The mechanisms of topochemical assembly are investigated, where a solid-solid transition is usually observed along the interface of PbI2/perovskite. An alternative pathway for crystal growth along a different coherent interface is achieved due to the introduction of intermediates. Therefore, an optimal (001)-oriented perovskite film is prepared, which possesses reduced lattice heterogeneity, electronic disorder, and microstructure defects. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.5%, while it exhibits high stability (99% retention for 2500 h by MPP tracking test; 95% retention (one sun, AM 1.5 G) for 500 h (IEC61215 protocols)).

Introduction of pentafluoroanilinium trifluoromethanesulfonate into PbI2 precursor solutions can afford preferred orientation, decrease defects, and enlarge grains, and that can enhance the performance of PSCs. Shao et al.117 have demonstrated the promoted preferential perovskite orientation growth due to the modulation of nucleation and crystallization in PbI2 films by incorporating pentafluoroanilinium trifluoromethanesulfonate into PbI2 precursor solutions to enhance the performance of PSCs. In this case, the modulatory PbI2 films serve as porous templates that promote the formation of perovskites with reduced PbI2 residues, a preferred orientation, decreased defects, and enlarged grains, possibly due to the acceleration of the formation of perovskite and the diminished Gibbs free energy of PbI2. Hence, the PSC exhibits outstanding PCE of 24.52%, while it exhibits high stability (~90% retention for 500 h in an N2 atmosphere at ∼55 °C under constant light irradiation by the MPP tracking test).

Utilization of reconstruction subsurface lattice strategy can afford the growth of perovskite with suitable crystal lattice, modulate the valence band alignment, diminish defects, enhance the carrier-selective transfer and improve the charge carrier lifetime, and that can enhance the performance of PSCs. Gao et al.118 have applied the reconstruction subsurface lattice strategy to achieve stable PSCs; while using this strategy, the positions of the I− and Pb2+ planes are simultaneously modulated. The corner-sharing octahedral is preferred, and high stability is achieved in the crystal lattice by the reconstructed lattice configuration, thereby stabilizing FA-based perovskites. Furthermore, the subsurface lattice reconstruction modulates the valence band alignment and diminishes defects, which enhances the carrier-selective transfer and improves the charge carrier lifetime. Consequently, the PSC exhibits a remarkable PCE of 25.2%, while it exhibits high stability (95% retention for 3000 h under illumination of simulated AM 1.5 by MPP tracking test; 96% retention for 6000 h of storage in a dry box at 25 °C under ∼20% relative humidity).

Various facet/lattice engineering strategies, including utilization of cyclohexylamine as an additive75, topochemical assembly strategy116, incorporating pentafluoroanilinium trifluoromethanesulfonate into PbI2 precursor solutions117, and reconstruction subsurface lattice strategy118, enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Strategies for defect/grain engineering and passivation for PSCs

Defect/grain engineering can improve the performance of the PSCs. Tuning the reaction kinetics through anion-π interaction of the AX component of ABX3 perovskite can decrease the defects, and afford high phase purity, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Huang et al.67 have tuned the reaction kinetics through anion-π interaction of the AX component of ABX3 perovskite with hexafluorobenzene, which is an alternative strategy to conventional methods that rely on the BX2 component. These two strategies are independent, but they work together to attain ‘dual-site regulation’, which leads to delicate control over the reaction of AX with BX2 without unwanted intermediates. As a result, the FAPbI3 perovskite film affords red-shifted absorption, lesser defects, and high phase purity without measurable nanoscale δ phase. Hence, the PSC exhibits a superior PCE of 26.07% and excellent stability (94% retention for 1258 h by MPP tracking test).

Lattice strains and phase transitions can be induced in halide perovskites by the variations in the daily temperature, and that can affect the stability of the PSCs. Therefore, developing PSCs that can be stable at variable temperature (ambient, low, and high temperature) is highly desirable. The introduction of suitable polymer with ordered dipolar structure into the perovskite precursor can stabilize the perovskite black phase, promote the growth of a low-defect crystalline film, generate the dipoles at the surface of the perovskite, diminish ion migration, enhance interfacial charge extraction, enhance hydrophobicity, and that can enhance the performance of PSCs at variable temperature. Li et al.78 have utilized the ordered dipolar structure of β-poly(1,1-difluoroethylene) (β-pV2F) for the stabilization of the perovskite black phase to enhance the performance of PSC by controlling the energy alignment and perovskite film crystallization. Therefore, the PSC exhibits enhanced PCE of 24.6% (Table 3), and it exhibits high stability (88 and 96% retention for 1000 h by MPP tracking test at 75° and 25 °C, respectively), while negligible signs of fatigue are observed for the PSCs at rapid thermal cycling between +80 °C and −60 °C, suggesting its high thermal cycling stability. The β-pV2F exhibits an ordered molecular dipole distribution due to the polymeric backbone of the β-pV2F and alternate symmetric hydro and fluorocarbon units. β-pV2F with 0.5 mg/mL (molecular weight: 180,000) had been used. Figure 3 depicts the role of β-pV2F on the work function and film morphology. The control perovskite film exhibits evident voids at the grain boundaries (average grain size: ~400 nm; Fig. 3a−c), where non-radiative recombination centers and shunting paths can be formed due to these defects. In contrast, the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits high density with large grain size (~480 nm; Fig. 3d−f). The XRD of the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits improved crystallinity as inferred from a smaller full width at half maximum in the (001) peak. The atomic force microscopy studies disclose that the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits a lesser surface roughness of 41.1 nm when compared to that of the control (54.4 nm), which can ameliorate coverage with charge-transporting layers. The adjacent hydrogen atoms in β-pV2F can have a partial positive charge density due to the fluorine atoms with electron-withdrawing effect. Furthermore, the β-pV2F exhibits an all-trans planar zigzag conformation, which is almost similar to a Lewis acid, and that can interact with the surface of the perovskite. In the FTIR spectra, the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits the –CH2 stretching vibration peak at 3019 cm−1 when compared to that of bare β-pV2F (3025 cm−1), possibly due to a solid C-H···X dipole interaction of –CH2 moieties with halide ions of the [PbX6]4− frame. Thus, the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits an upward shift of the surface work function (Fig. 3g), possibly due to the change in crystallization during film growth caused by the aforementioned polar interaction between β-pV2F and precursors. Therefore, the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits an increase in surface work function up to 300 meV (Fig. 3h) when compared to that of the control, and that can enhance the interfacial charge extraction and improve the stability of PSC.

Effective rejuvenated of aged perovskite quantum dots can be achieved through in situ defect healing treatment. Chen et al.119 have effectively rejuvenated aged perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) using in situ defect healing treatment (DHT). Theoretical calculations and experimental studies disclose that the surface matrix defects of aged PQDs could be strongly anchored by the I3− anions generated from tetra-n-octylammonium iodide and iodine, which can considerably reduce the non-radiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, the morphology of aged PQDs could be renovated by DHT, which can enhance the stacking orientation of PQD solids and considerably ameliorate charge carrier transport within PQD solids. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 15.88%, while it exhibits high stability (60% retention for 200 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of suitable grain modulator can consolidate the crystal structure, while utilization of redox-active radical polymer can effectively p-dope the hole-transporting material through hole injection, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. You et al.68 have performed two strategies (grain modulation and radical polymeric p-doping) to enhance the performance of the PSC. A phosphonic acid-functionalized fullerene derivative is introduced in mixed-cation perovskites as a modulator for the grain boundary to consolidate the crystal structure, thereby improving the resistance of the perovskite sheet against heat, moisture, and illumination. Furthermore, the poly(oxoammonium salt) as a redox-active radical polymer is used to effectively p-dope the hole-transporting material through hole injection, which also inhibits the diffusion of lithium ions. Hence, the PSC and mini-module demonstrate satisfactory PCE of 23.5% (1 cm2) and 21.4% (17.1 cm2), respectively, while maintains high stability (95.5% retention for 3265 h by MPP tracking test at 70° ± 5 °C).

Several strategies have been applied to enhance the passivation of the perovskites to enhance the performance of PSCs. The library of low-dimensional capping materials with metal cations can be expanded by processing a full precursor solution with both metal and ammonium halides rather than the commonly used Pb2+ and Sn2+, where a zero-dimensional zinc-based halogenometallate can induce stronger n–N isotype three-dimensional/low-dimensional heterojunctions and higher surface passivation when compared to its lead-based counterpart, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Ye et al.69 have expanded the library of low-dimensional capping materials with metal cations rather than the commonly used Pb2+ and Sn2+ by processing a full precursor solution with both metal and ammonium halides. Thus, facile synthetic control is achieved for the low-dimensional capping layer, while greater versatility is attained for low-dimensional interface engineering. Therefore, a 0D PEA2ZnX4 (zinc-based halogenometallate; PEA = phenethylammonium, X = Cl/I) exhibits much higher surface passivation and robust n-N isotype 3D/low-dimensional heterojunctions when compared to that of lead-based counterpart. The resulted PSC exhibits a superior PCE of 24.1% with high stability (94.5% retention for 1009 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of dimethylacridine-based molecular doping process can effectively passivate the grain boundaries, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Tan et al.120 have demonstrated a dimethylacridine-based molecular doping process to build a well-matched p-perovskite/ITO contact with passivation of grain boundaries to attain enhanced performance for PSCs. Thus, a molecule-extrusion process occurs, where the molecules can be extruded to the grain boundaries from the precursor solution, while the crystallization process occurs at the bottom of the film surface in the chlorobenzene-quenching process. The core coordination complex of lead polyiodide of perovskite with the deprotonated phosphonic acid group of the molecule is accountable for both electronic charge transfer and mechanical absorption, and that cause p-type doping of the perovskite film. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 25.86%, while it exhibits high stability (96.6% retention for 1000 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of pseudo-halide anion engineering strategy can effectively passivate the surface, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Xu et al.121 have performed pseudo-halide anion engineering for bifunctional surface passivation to enhance the performance of PSCs, while a machine learning workflow is demonstrated to facilitate the discovery process through full-DFT calculations for training the model. Thus, promising molecules with a head group can be identified through the physics-informed machine learning model, and that inhibits anti-site defect generation and lattice distortion, while a tail group is optimized for robust attachment to the surface. Furthermore, 15 potential bifunctional pseudo-halide anions having the ability to passivate both acceptors and donors are identified, where the most effective passivant is sodium thioglycolate. As a consequence, this strategy contributes to PSC with unexceptional PCE of 24.56% and robust stability (96% retention for 900 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of ligand reactivity engineering strategy can afford stable PSCs at high-temperatures. Park et al.122 have demonstrated ligand reactivity engineering to achieve stable PSCs at high-temperatures. Ammonium ligands are utilized, which are non-reactive with the bulk of perovskites, while a library is determined that alters ligand molecular structure systematically. Thus, fluorinated aniliniums exhibit interfacial passivation and, at the same-time, reduce reactivity with perovskites. Hence, the PSC exhibits a large PCE of 24.09%, while it exhibits high stability (85% retention for 1560 h by MPP tracking test at 85 °C and 50% relative humidity).

Introduction of insulator layer having optimal thickness with random nanoscale openings between the absorber and transport layer can diminish surface recombination, while the crystallinity and bulk recombination lifetime can also be enhanced, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Peng et al.123 have introduced ∼100-nm-thick insulator layers with random nanoscale openings between the absorber and transport layer without deteriorating both the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor (FF) to diminish surface recombination and achieve high-performance PSCs. Drift-diffusion simulations are conducted for cells having this porous-insulator contact and comprehended with a solution process through managing the growth mode of Al2O3 nanoplates. Thus, the 87.9% of the Shockley-Queisser limit is the product of Voc × FF, while the surface recombination velocity was diminished to 9.2 cm s−1 from 64.2 cm s−1 at the p-type contact, and the bulk recombination lifetime is elevated to 6.0 μs from 1.2 μs due to the enhancement in the crytallinity of perovskite. As a result, the PSC with a porous-insulator contact with a ∼25% diminished contact area exhibits a high PCE of 25.56%, while it exhibits high stability (>98% retention for 1000 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of in situ tin selenide deposition strategy can enhance the surface crystallization and diminish the number of surface traps, and that can enhance the performance of PSCs. Chen et al.124 have obtained PEA2(FA0.5MA0.5)4(Pb0.5Sn0.5)5I16 (n = 5) with a gradient structure through a two-step blade coating. Furthermore, improved surface crystallization and a diminished number of surface traps are observed for the perovskite films after treatment with tin (II) acetate and N,N-dimethylselenourea, due to the in situ generation of tin selenide, where the active layer is well protected from the environment by this hydrophobic tin selenide. Therefore, the PSC exhibits PCE of 15.06% with a VOC of 0.855 V and negligible hysteresis, while it exhibits high stability (100% retention for 15 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of crystallization strategy can passivate the defects and enhance the crystallization, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Zhang et al.125 have demonstrated holistic defect passivation and crystallization manipulation through the crystallization strategy via a novel intermediate phase to construct high-quality perovskite films to achieve high-performance PSCs. Thus, the orientational growth of the α-phase perovskite is promoted during crystallization after introducing phenformin hydrochloride (PFCl) into the precursor solution, where the intermediate phase PFCl•FAI diminishes the formation of the δ yellow phase. Furthermore, a post-treatment is performed using multiactive-site S-methylisothiosemicarbazide hydroiodide, leading to a reduction in the bulk and interfacial trap-assisted non-radiative recombination losses, which is attributed to diminished defects, enhanced crystallization, and released residual stress. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.67%, while it exhibits high light and thermal stability (94% retention for 600 h by MPP tracking test; 84% retention for 1008 h at constant light illumination; 90% retention for 864 h at constant heating at 85 °C).

Utilization of surface n-type band bending strategy can enable the p to n-type transition at the surface and passivate the defects, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Wang et al.126 have demonstrated a surface n-type band bending strategy to alleviate the severe energy losses in inverted PSCs at the interface between the n-type ETL and p-type perovskite. Furthermore, a p to n-type transition is observed at the surface of the CsPbI3 due to the post-deposition of propylamine hydrochloride to expedite the extraction and separation of the electrons while passivating the defects of the surface. Hence, the PSC exhibits an outstanding PCE of 20.17% (38.93% at indoor light illumination using LED with 307 mW cm−2 having 1000 lux) with robust stability (∼97% retention for 792 h in light soaking at the open circuit condition).

The α-phase of FAPbI3 can be stabilized without band gap broadening by utilizing suitable cations and anions. Yoo et al.127 have utilized R4N+ cations and Cl− anions for the stabilization of the α-phase of FAPbI3 without band gap broadening. The resulted PSC and module exhibit unexpected PCE of 24.53% and 21.23% (36.4 cm2), respectively, while the perovskite solar module exhibits high stability (93% retention for 870 h at constant one-sun illumination).

The utilization of two alkylammonium halide modulators can inhibit halide phase segregation and enhance passivation, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. In addition, Alharbi et al.128 have utilized two alkylammonium halide modulators to enhance the stability and PCE of PSCs based on FA0.65MA0.35Pb(I0.65Br0.35)3 and α-FAPbI3, where the modulators inhibit halide phase segregation induced by light in the former. The 2D NMR studies disclose that the modulators are found at grain boundaries and surfaces, while the computational studies reveal that the modulators exhibit a higher passivation effect when compared to that of established compounds. Therefore, the PSC based on α-FAPbI3 exhibits a high PCE of 24.9%, while it exhibits high stability (∼90% retention for 1200 h by MPP tracking test).

The utilization of suitable surface passivation can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Hieulle et al.129 have discovered the effect of white light in the degradation of the surface of FAPbI3-rich perovskite absorbers through computational studies and multiscale characterization techniques. Thus, the degradation kinetics are investigated, where the chemical degradation of perovskite into secondary phases with metallic I-V characteristics and a larger work function is triggered by the white light. In addition, the degradation of perovskite has been triggered by a synergetic effect of the defects in perovskite and the illumination of light. In addition, surface passivation is performed to determine the effect of defect sensitivity in the degradation process. Furthermore, the light-induced degradation of perovskite with respect to the wavelength is determined by utilizing filtered light. Therefore, the PSC exhibits a large PCE of 22%, while it exhibits high stability (75% retention for 500 h by MPP tracking test).

The utilization of solid-phase passivation strategy can alleviate the usage of solvents for passivation, enhance the passivation and diminish the carrier non-radiative recombination loss, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Luo et al.130 have utilized 2-mercaptopyridine as a passivator on pre-prepared solid-state films to bond surface uncoordinated Pb2+ defects through a solvent-free solid-phase passivation (SPP) route rather than the conventional solution processing route. Furthermore, owing to the robust coordination ability of the passivator with the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects, the passivator is found to anchor on the defect sites of the surface of the perovskite film even if the passivator film is destroyed. Thus, the defect passivation considerably diminishes the carrier non-radiative recombination loss. Hence, the PSC exhibits an excellent PCE of 25.2%, a high VOC of 1.20 V, and a low voltage loss of 0.34 V, while it exhibits high stability (92% retention for 800 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of organic iodides can enhance the energy barrier for iodine interstitial migration and improve the defect passivation, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Ren et al.131 have utilized organic iodides to enhance the performance of the PSCs. Thus, the energy barrier for iodine interstitial (Ii) migration is increased by the organic iodides with suitable cations, possibly due to their strong interaction with the surface of the perovskite, where the interaction emerges from a high dipole moment and a stable steric alignment. The role of four classical phenylalkylammonium iodides on Ii migration is studied, where the length of the alkyl chain of cations possesses influence on the inhibition of Ii migration. As a result of Ii migration inhibition and defect passivation on the surface of the perovskite film, the phenylpropylammonium iodide-treated PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.2%, while it exhibits high stability (92% retention for 240 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of phase transition engineering strategy can improve the crystallinity, and modulate the energy levels, conductivity, carrier mobility, and trap states, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Chen et al.132 have utilized a holistic strategy to enhance carrier transportation in a SnO2/perovskite stack. At first, the NT:SnO2 is obtained by co-doping Nb5+ and Ta5+ with SnO2, which can modulate the energy levels, conductivity, carrier mobility, and trap states, while the NT:SnO2 tunes the crystallization process of the perovskites, leading to improved crystallinity. Furthermore, carrier lifetime is increased to >3 μs, and non-radiative recombination is considerably decreased after the introduction of 4,4’-dithiodibutyric acid as a multifunctional passivator molecule to subsequently passivate the charged traps in perovskites. As a result, the PSC exhibits satisfactory PCE of 25.3%, while it exhibits high stability (90% retention for 1200 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of interfacial-engineering method can effectively passivate the defects and diminish the trap densities, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Kim et al.133 have demonstrated an interfacial-engineering approach containing the in situ thermal phase transition of AAFos (AAFos: alkylammonium formates) to effectively passivate the defects to enhance the performance of PSCs. AAFos is composed of a big organic cation with a pseudohalide anion, which can be involved at relatively low temperatures in the passivation process as the liquid phase due to the weak coordination between the anions and cations. Thus, the AAFos exhibits several merits in interfacial engineering: (a) The grain boundaries of perovskites can be effectively passivated by the AAFos to diminish the trap densities by improving the liquid-like behavior of the AAFo. (b) The effective passivation at iodide vacancies is achieved to enhance the thermal stability due to the formate anion, where the fromate anion has a comparatively larger affinity with iodide vacancies when compared to that of other halides. (c) The moisture stability is enhanced by the decylammonium cations with lengthy alkyl chain which inhibits the permeation of moisture into the perovskite layer. Therefore, the PSC and module exhibit high PCE of 25% and 20.82% (23.75 cm2), respectively, while the PSC exhibits high thermal and moisture stability.

Utilization of suitable aging-resistant precursor can afford higher crystallinity and larger grain size, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Huang et al.134 have added 2,3,5-trichlorobenzaldehyde with chloride ions and a C═O group (3Cl-BZH; Fig. 4a) into the solution (organic salt precursor) to alleviate the excess organic amine formation by Schiff-base reactions, and that enhances the stability of the precursor solution and prevents further irreversible amine-cation reactions of formamidine-methylammonium (FA-MA+). The FTIR is performed to investigate the interaction of 3Cl-BZH with organic salt (Fig. 4b, c). The stretching vibration peak of C═O exhibits a shift to 1638 cm−1 from 1628 cm−1, and the stretching vibration peak of N─H exhibits a shift to 3451 cm−1 from 3438 cm−1 after mixing FAI with 3Cl-BZH, suggesting the existence of a chemical interaction of the C═O group of 3Cl-BZH with FA+. Thus, slower black phase formation is occurring, possibly due to the delay of the reaction of FAI with PbI2 after the addition of 3Cl-BZH. Therefore, a higher crystallinity and larger grain size of perovskite are obtained due to the delayed organic ion release and slow reaction when compared to the original unannealed film, as shown in Fig. 4d. Figure 4e depicts the schematic diagram that illustrates the role of 3Cl-BZH on the crystallization process of perovskite films. If 3Cl-BZH is not used, a rapid reaction can occur between FAI and PbI2, which can form a perovskite layer on top of PbI2, inhibit the diffusion of FAI into the inner PbI2 layer, and provide a perovskite phase with low crystallinity and excess PbI2 residues. In contrast, the diffusion rate of FAI within the PbI2 matrix has been slowed down after the introduction of 3Cl-BZH, leading to the gradual crystallization of perovskite nuclei, while the interaction of 3Cl-BZH with FAI enhances the perovskite reaction, resulting in the generation of an orderly and uniform organic salt layer, leading to the formation of high-quality perovskite films. Therefore, the PSC with 3Cl-BZH (with defect passivation effect) using a conventional annealing process exhibits a high PCE of 24.08% and high stability, while it exhibits a high PCE of 22.01% after broadening the annealing window of the wet perovskite sheet in the air atmosphere to 240 h, suggesting its prospects towards commercialization.

Utilization of room-temperature molten salt-mediated perovskite growth strategy using dimethylamine formate can afford low-defect density and a large grain size, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Zai et al.135 have added dimethylamine formate (DMAFa, a room-temperature molten salt) into the precursor solution to control the crystallization behavior of CsPbI3 perovskite films. The coordination of DMAFa with Pb2+ can form HCOO−-Pb2+ in the initial stage, and subsequent annealing gradually decompose the HCOO−-Pb2+ into I−-Pb2+, leading to a delay in crystallization rate, while the defects of the perovskite films can be passivated by the interaction of DMA+ with the uncoordinated Pb2+, and that generates a high-quality CsPbI3 film with a low-defect density and a large grain size. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 20.4% while it exhibits high stability.

In situ polymerization of cross-linked perovskite-polymer composites can enhance the crystallinity and increase the grain size, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Guo et al.136 have demonstrated cross-linked perovskite-polymer composites with in situ polymerization to enhance the performance of PSCs, where the acrylamide monomers are cross-linked with the assistance of light to the non-crystalline perovskite films. The preferred crystal orientation in the polycrystalline perovskite films is induced by the acrylamide monomers, and the perovskite grain size is enlarged while the perovskite grains are cross-linked. The cross-linked interfacial layer protects the perovskite film against water corrosion, where this layer acts as an airtight wall. Furthermore, the lattice strain during perovskite-film crystallization is effectively released by the liquid properties of acrylamide. Hence, the PSC and module exhibit remarkable PCE of 24.45% and 20.31% (33 cm2), respectively, and the PSC exhibits high stability, while it exhibits a high VOC of 1.199 V, which is a higher VOC than that previously reported for promising hybrid PSCs with TiO2 as ETLs.

The utilization of suitable ionic liquid as co-solvent can modulate the crystallinity, and afford interfacial band alignment and effective charge transport of the screen-printed film, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Chen et al.137 have demonstrated the fabrication of fully screen-printed perovskite solar cells with a high PCE of 16.95% towards commercialization through modulating confined perovskite crystallization within the mesoporous layer. The complete volatilization of ionic liquid methylamine acetate (MAAc) is achieved, and perovskite crystals with high filling degree within the mesoporous structure are attained due to the addition of ionic liquid MAPa (MAPa: methylamine propionate) with robust coordination as a co-solvent to stimulate the escape of MAAc molecules, where volatilization channels for solvent are generated in a confined mesoporous structure. Additionally, interfacial band alignment and effective charge transport of the screen-printed film are achieved due to the MAPa, where the vertical growth of perovskite crystals is stimulated by MAPa and the unbonded Pb2+ is coordinated by MAPa on the surface of the perovskite. Hence, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 16.95%, while it exhibits high stability (∼85.3% retention for 250 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of halogenated phenylethylammonium iodide salts can effectively tune the passivation of the perovskite, while the meta-substituted cations can afford better performance than that of ortho and para counterparts, which could be due to the higher interfacial dipoles and lower formation energies, and that could enhance the performance of the PSCs. Gozukara Karabag et al.138 have modulated the passivation of 2D perovskite, while the role of steric and electronic effects on the performance of 3D/2D PSCs has been investigated. Thus, several halogenated PEA+ iodide salts are prepared through the facile route, and the salts are deposited on the top of 3D perovskite, where the salts are x-XPEAI (x is ortho (o), meta (m), or para (p); X is F, Cl, or Br). The grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering analyses and XRD investigation disclose the formation of a 2D perovskite layer for all cations, irrespective of the position and nature of the halogen. Theoretical calculations disclose that m-substituted cations exhibit higher performance when compared to their o- and p- counterparts owing to their higher interfacial dipoles and lower formation energies. Therefore, the PSC with m-BrPEAI exhibits a high PCE of 23.42%, while the PSC with m-ClPEAI exhibits high stability (87% retention for 1000 h by MPP tracking test).

The utilization of β-alaninamide hydrochloride can generate in situ formation of 2D perovskite seeding, which can enhance the quality of crystallization, provide uniformity of perovskite film, and that can enhance the performance of indoor PSCs. Li et al.139 have utilized β-alaninamide hydrochloride, which spontaneously generates a layer of 2D perovskite nucleation seeds, to enhance the quality of crystallization, uniformity of film, and performance of indoor PSCs. The charge carrier lifetime is increased 10-fold after the introduction of β-alaninamide hydrochloride due to the enhanced film quality with lesser lattice stress, smaller trap density, and better uniformity. Hence, the indoor PSCs presents impressive PCE of 42.12% (0.09 cm2), 40.93% (1.0 cm2), and 40.07% (2.56 cm2) with light intensity of 1000.52, 1000.69, and 1000.85 lux, respectively, with LED illumination, while it exhibits high stability.

Utilization of uracil as a binder in the perovskite film can strengthen grain boundaries, effectively passivate defects, strengthen the interface between ETL and perovskite, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Wang et al.79 have utilized uracil as a binder in the perovskite film to improve the performance of PSCs. The uracil can strengthen grain boundaries and effectively passivate defects to improve the stability of perovskite films, while it strengthens the interface between ETL (SnO2) and perovskite to enhance the binding force. Hence, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.23% with negligible hysteresis and high reproducibility, while it exhibits robust stability (90% retention for 5960 h by MPP tracking test) and high reproducibility.

Utilization of surface in situ reconstruction strategy using CsF treatment can enhance hole extraction, inhibit non-radiative recombination, effectively passivate the surface defects, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Chu et al.140 have demonstrated a surface in situ reconstruction strategy to enhance the efficiency of the PSC through CsF treatment for inorganic perovskite to enhance hole extraction and inhibit non-radiative recombination, while the mechanism has been verified by experiments and kinetic calculations. Thus, effective passivation of surface defects can be achieved after the incorporation of fluorine, while a prolonged carrier lifetime of 737.2 ns is obtained from 11.5 ns. Additionally, a wider-bandgap perovskite layer can be formed as a graded heterojunction to enhance hole extraction. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 21.02%, a fill factor of 85.3%, and an open-circuit voltage of 1.27 V, while it exhibits high stability (86% retention for 400 h by MPP tracking test).

Strategies for defect/grain engineering67,68,78,119 and passivation129 including expansion of the library of low-dimensional capping materials with metal cations69, dimethylacridine-based molecular doping process120, pseudo-halide anion engineering121, introduction of insulator layer having optimal thickness with random nanoscale openings between the absorber and transport layer123, in situ tin selenide deposition124, crystallization strategy125, surface n-type band bending strategy126, utilization of R4N+ cations and Cl− anions127, utilization of two alkylammonium halide modulators128, solvent-free solid-phase passivation route130, utilization of organic iodides131, phase transition engineering132, interfacial-engineering method133, utilization of aging-resistant precursor134, room-temperature molten salt-mediated perovskite growth135, in situ polymerization of cross-linked perovskite-polymer composites136, modulation of confined perovskite crystallization137, modulation of the passivation of 2D perovskite138, in situ formation of 2D perovskite seeding139, utilization of uracil as a binder into the perovskite film79, and surface in situ reconstruction strategy140 enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Dion–Jacobson/hybrid perovskite for PSCs

Designing suitable Dion–Jacobson (DJ)/hybrid perovskite can enhance the performance of PSCs. Utilization of triple-solvent engineering strategy can afford pure-phase, finely oriented crystal grains and a homogenous quantum well width structure for DJ-2D perovskites, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Ahmad et al.74 have designed 4APP(FA)3Pb4I13-based quasi-DJ-2D perovskite (4APP: 4-aminopiperidinium) to improve the stability of the PSCs. The 4APP possesses strong rigidity and robust hydrogen bonding ability with the perovskite, leading to an obvious increase in the intrinsic stability of the perovskite. The DJ-2D perovskites with pure-phase, finely oriented crystal grains and a homogenous quantum well width structure are obtained through the triple-solvent engineering strategy by coordinating solvent properties. Thus, the PCE of the unencapsulated PSCs is improved by 48% using MA-free DJ 2D perovskite (n ≤ 4). As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 17.27% (Table 4), while it exhibits high stability (95% retention for 2000 h at 40 °C by MPP tracking test for the unencapsulated device; 95% retention for >3000 h in air at 85 °C with 60–90% relative humidity).

The performance of the PSCs can be improved using 2D/3D heterostructure, where the amidino based DJ 2D perovskite can afford skeleton for 3D growth upon the dissolution-recrystallization process, which can diminish bulk defects and alleviate volume collapse. Yang et al.141 have utilized amidino-based Dion–Jacobson 2D perovskite to achieve stable and efficient FAPbI3-based 2D/3D heterostructure in PSCs. Time-resolved optical diagnostics is utilized to investigate the effect of DJ 2D perovskite on the nucleation and growth mechanisms and crystallization pathways of 3D perovskite. The crystallization process of the 2D/3D perovskite in comparison with the neat 3D perovskite is illustrated in Fig. 5. FA-rich α-phase perovskites are formed by the preferential crystallization of 3D perovskite during the following perovskite film fabrication processes, including spin coating, dissolution, and recrystallization, when the entrapped DMSO eliminates the bulk film in the course of thermal annealing. Thus, void generation at grain boundaries on 3D perovskite induced by the volume collapse of the crystals is observed due to the evaporation of DMSO and the uniform nucleation in the course of dissolution-recrystallization equilibrium. In contrast, the nucleation and growth pathways are altered and the volume collapse is inhibited by the DJ 2D perovskite, where a high-quality perovskite film with suppressed bulk defects and voids is obtained due to the modulated crystallization process, leading to efficient charge transport. Hence, the PSCs exhibit a high PCE of 24.9% (on rigid substrate) and 22.3% (on flexible substrate), while the PSC exhibits high stability, and high bending cycle stability for flexible solar cells (92% retention for 3000 bending cycles).

Utilization of suitable solvent and ligand for quasi-2D-DJ phases on 3D perovskites can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Ramakrishnan et al.142 have utilized 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol as a solvent and 3-aminomethylpyridine as a ligand for the fabrication of quasi-2D DJ phases on 3D perovskites to achieve enhanced performance for PSCs. In situ X-ray scattering is used to determine the structural evolution and solvent-mediated formation dynamics of 2D and 3D heterostructures. The spatial distribution of quasi-2D phases for n is from 2 to 4, and the formation sequence is determined by the interaction of the solvent with the 3D surface. When isoproponol is used as a solvent, the perovskite is reconstructed into a PbI2-rich surface, where a strata is generated with a smaller n first, and then a thinner substratum is formed with a larger n. However, when 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol is used as a solvent, the 3D surface is protected, thereby enhancing the generation of homogenously distributed larger n domains first and smaller n last. Thus, DJ perovskites have been utilized with excellent charge transport properties and structural robustness to construct 2D/3D heterostructures with n ≥ 3 and design a suitable energy landscape for electron tunneling. Hence, the PSC exhibits impressive PCE of 23.6%, with high stability (94% retention for 960 h at 85 °C).

Fabrication of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite by incorporating a tiny amount of organic cations for inorganic cations can increase the optoelectronic properties, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Jiang et al.143 have prepared tetragonal (β-) (DMA, Cs)PbI3 by incorporating a tiny amount of DMA+ (large organic cation) for Cs+ with a small ionic radius, while the obvious evidence for the generation of organic-inorganic hybrids is provided. The hybrid organic-inorganic β-(DMA, Cs)PbI3 with a dominant inorganic composition exhibits higher optoelectronic properties when compared to that of inorganic orthorhombic (γ-phase) CsPbI3, suggesting the beneficial substitution of a small quantity of DMA+.As a result, the PSC exhibits a satisfactory PCE of 19.76%, while maintains high stability (95% retention for ~186 h by MPP tracking test).

Designing suitable Dion–Jacobson (DJ)/hybrid perovskite, including 4-aminopiperidinium-based quasi-DJ-2D perovskite74, amidino-based DJ-2D perovskite96, utilization of suitable solvent and ligand for quasi-2D-DJ phases on 3D perovskites142, and fabrication of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite by incorporating a tiny amount of DMA+ for Cs+ 143 enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Strategies for using ambient conditions and/or water for the fabrication of PSCs

The fabrication of PSCs in ambient air and/or water can prevent the moisture-induced severe degradation of the perovskite layer, and that can trigger their industrialization. The introduction of guanabenz acetate salt can inhibit perovskite hydration, alleviate both anion and cation vacancies, and crystallize a high-quality film for the fabrication of PSCs in ambient air. Yan et al.71 have utilized guanabenz acetate salt to prevent perovskite hydration, obviate both anion and cation vacancies, and crystallize a high-quality film for the fabrication of PSCs in ambient air. Hence, the PSC exhibits a remarkable PCE of 25.32% (Table 5), while it exhibits high stability (96% retention for 500 h by MPP tracking test; 85% retention for 300 h under damp heat conditions with 85% relative humidity at 85 °C). The cause of the generation of good-quality perovskite sheet in ambient air was determined. There is an initial interaction stage of moisture with perovskite, but the hydration pathway is blocked by the utilization of guanabenz acetate salt, and thus a high-quality perovskite film is formed in ambient air. The left side of Fig. 6a depicts the mechanism of moisture-induced decomposition. The water molecules can be more easily bound in energetics with an atom exposed by a vacancy in perovskite at the initial stage of the hydration process. Consequently, FAI will be escaped and the Pb2I62− framework will be collapsed. The DFT calculations disclose the binding energy of water molecules with the perovskite (Fig. 6b) and the critical role of vacancies on hydration. FA+ and I− vacancies are readily generated during the deposition of the film. If I− vacancy occurs, then the binding energies are −1.450 eV for H2O with FA+, − 0.610 eV for H2O with Pb2+, and −1.189 eV for H2O with I−. If FA+ vacancy occurs, then the binding energies are −1.134 eV for H2O with FA+, −1.133 eV for H2O with Pb2+, and −1.461 eV for H2O with I−. However, in the ideal perovskite structure, the binding energies are 1.020 eV for H2O with FA+, 1.446 eV for H2O with Pb2+, and 1.774 eV for H2O with I−. These results disclose that the degradation of the perovskite can occur due to the hydration of the perovskite by the absorption of water molecules at the sites adjacent to vacancy defects. Thus, eliminating vacancies can be a viable way to diminish the sensitivity of perovskites to moisture.

The right side of Fig. 6a depicts that the utilization of guanabenz acetate salt can remove vacancies through interaction with perovskite. The aromatic amine salt guanabenz acetate contains acetate (AC−) and guanidine groups, where the AC− exhibits robust coordination ability, while a larger number of effective hydrogen bonds can be formed by the terminated guanidine group in the benzene ring when compared to that of FA+. In the FTIR spectra (Fig. 6c), the peaks of C=O and C-O of guanabenz acetate salt with perovskite film exhibit a shift towards a lower wave number when compared to that of guanabenz acetate salt, suggesting the existence of an interaction of guanabenz acetate salt with perovskite. Furthermore, in the high-resolution XPS spectra of Pb 4f (Fig. 6d), the target film affords an obvious downshift when compared to its counterpart, which suggests that the guanabenz acetate salt can bind with the unsaturated Pb2+, thereby eliminating the I− vacancy. If I− vacancies occur, the unsaturated Pb2+ will preferentially bind with AC− by a robust Pb-O bond instead of the water molecule because the binding energy of Pb2+-AC− is −2.401 eV, which is much lower than that of the −0.610 eV for Pb2+-H2O. Furthermore, the energetic stability calculation and generated hydrogen bond suggest that the terminated guanidine group of guanabenz acetate salt can be responsible for the filling of FA+ vacancies. In the high-resolution XPS spectra, the target film exhibits a downshift when compared to that of the control film, which suggests that the AC− is responsible for the filling of the I− vacancy and the generation of a hydrogen bond between the I atom and the terminated guanidine group of guanabenz acetate salt. In the FTIR spectra, the peak of C=N of guanabenz acetate salt with PbI2 film exhibits a shift towards a lower wave number when compared to that of guanabenz acetate salt, suggesting the existence of an interaction of the terminated guanidine group of guanabenz acetate salt with PbI2 film by a hydrogen bond. Additionally, the DFT calculations suggest that the formation of I− vacancy is suppressed by 0.28 eV when FA+ vacancy is filled by the terminated guanidine, and thus a stable perovskite lattice is formed.

A deep energy level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) investigation (Fig. 6e) is performed to validate the elimination of I− and FA+ vacancies by guanabenz acetate salt in perovskite. In the DLTS plot, the control sheet shows two peaks indicated as T1 and T2, suggesting the existence of two kinds of dominant traps. In contrast, the absence of trap peaks is observed in the target film, suggesting the elimination of vacancy after the introduction of guanabenz acetate salt in perovskite. To determine the activation energy of the corresponding traps, the Arrhenius plots have been fitted (Fig. 6f) based on the Arrhenius equation (ln(tau × Vth × Nc) = ((ET − EV)/KT) − ln(XPσP)). The symbols denote the following terms: K: Boltzmann constant; Nc: effective density of states of the trap in cm−3; XP: entropy factor; tau: emission time constant; Vth: thermal velocity; ET: energy level of the trap center; EV: energy level of VBM; σP: capture cross section; T: temperature of the test. The ΔE = ET − EV is the trap activation energy, where the ΔE of T1 is calculated to be 0.51 eV for FA+ vacancy and the ΔE of T2 is calculated to be 0.39 eV for I− vacancy in the control film. The space-charge-limited current investigation further corroborates the DLTS investigation. Furthermore, the target film exhibits higher carrier mobility (2.68 cm2 V−1 s−1) and diffusion length (3.92 μm) when compared to that of the control film (1.98 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.96 μm). Additionally, the effects of the diminished moisture sensitivity of perovskite with guanabenz acetate salt due to the elimination of vacancies are analyzed. The FA+ vacancy is filled by terminated guanidine groups, and the I− vacancy is filled by AC− of guanabenz acetate salt, where the calculated binding energies (Fig. 6g) are 0.790 eV for H2O molecules with FA+, 0.373 eV for H2O molecules with Pb2+, and 0.475 eV for H2O molecules with I−. The binding energies of H2O molecules with the perovskite are negative (Fig. 6b), whereas the binding energies of H2O molecules are positive (Fig. 6g) after the introduction of guanabenz acetate salt, which suggests that the H2O molecules are harder to bind (not spontaneous or immediate) with the perovskite after the introduction of guanabenz acetate salt. Therefore, the perovskite hydration is intercepted due to guanabenz acetate salt, which could guard the crystallization of perovskite from moisture, and thus high-quality perovskite film deposition is obtained in ambient air (Fig. 6a) for the fabrication of efficient PSCs.

The introduction of dry air and a surfactant (potassium oleate) can enable water to act as a green solvent for the fabrication of perovskite. Zhang et al.72 have utilized dry air and a surfactant (potassium oleate), which enables water to act as a green solvent for the fabrication of perovskite, to achieve enhanced performance of PSCs. At first, the crystallization process of Pb(NO3)2 under various relative humidity conditions is investigated. The moisture in the ambient air acts a crucial role in the nucleation rate of Pb(NO3)2 and the spreading dynamics of aqueous inks, where the high surface tension of water can severely deteriorate the morphology of the perovskite film. Hence, the surface tension of water is diminished by using long-alkyl-chain potassium oleate as an anionic surfactant. Therefore, pinhole-free, high-quality, conformal perovskite film with enlarged grain size can be prepared by the synergistic effect of oleate anion and dry air, while potassium oleate modulates the crystallinity of Pb(NO3)2, which can improve the crystallization of PbI2 and enhance the formation kinetics of perovskite. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.14%, while it exhibits high stability (95.2% retention for 800 h by MPP tracking test).

The introduction of NH4+ as a volatile cation can easily eliminate acetate during annealing for the fabrication of high quality perovskite film in an ambient laboratory environment. Zhao et al.144 have utilized NH4+ as a volatile cation for the facile elimination of acetate during annealing, and thus high-quality formamidinium-caesium mixed-cation perovskite films are prepared using a lead acetate-based precursor formulation by blade-coating in an ambient laboratory environment. As a result, the PSC and module exhibit high PCE of 21% and 18.8% (10 cm2), respectively, while the PSC exhibits high stability (80% retention for 327 h by MPP tracking test (PTAA as HTL)) and high thermal stability (negligible decay for 3300 h at 65 °C).

Utilization of machine learning-guided robotic platforms can enable the fabrication of high quality perovskite in an ambient atmosphere. Zhang et al.145 have demonstrated the SPINBOT (fully automated spin-coating platform) for the engineering of solution-processed functional thin films for high-performance PSCs. Using SPINBOT, experiments can be conducted with high sampling variability, where hundreds of substrates can be processed without supervision with superior experimental control. The Bayesian optimization algorithm can enable the iterative optimization process, and thus an intricate parameter space can be explored by the SPINBOT, which constantly enhances the reproducibility and quality of the prepared thin films. Thus, the exploration of the optimization process of PSCs can be enabled by this machine-learning-guided reliable SPINBOT platform through the facile photoluminescence characterization of thin films. Thus, utilizing a machine-learning-guided, robotic platform, the perovskite thin-film parameter spaces are optimized. As a result, the PSC obtained in an ambient atmosphere exhibits a high PCE of 21.6%, while it exhibits high stability (85% retention for 1570 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of aqueous halide-free nanofluids can control the formation kinetics of a perovskite through a grain refinement strategy for the fabrication of green water-processed PSCs. Zhai et al.146 have utilized aqueous halide-free nanofluids to control the formation kinetics of a perovskite through a grain refinement strategy, while in situ UV-Vis absorption and PL measurements are performed to investigate the crystallization process, where anion configurations and the microstructure of PbI2 play a vital role in the formation kinetics. Subsequently, the reaction rate is promoted to ∼30% by using PbCO3 nanofluids with an inert CO32− (carbonate anion), where the formation of FA vacancy defects is efficiently hindered by CO32− at the surface of a FA-based perovskite. As a result, the green water-processed PSC obtained in dry-air atmosphere exhibits a high PCE of 23.64% while it exhibits high stability.

Strategies for using ambient conditions and/or water for the fabrication of PSCs, including the utilization of guanabenz acetate salt71, dry air and surfactant (potassium oleate)72, NH4+ as a volatile cation for the facile elimination of acetate during annealing144, machine learning-guided robotic platforms145, and aqueous halide-free nanofluids146, enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Flexible/bifacial PSCs

Developing flexible PSCs with high performance is highly desirable for the application of wearable electronics, intelligent vehicles, uncrewed aerial vehicles, and building-integrated photovoltaics76,147. Utilization of molecular dipole engineering strategy can release the strain for the fabrication of mechanically strong and flexible PSCs. Xie et al.76 have fabricated mechanically strong and flexible PSCs by using molecular dipole engineering strategy to release the strain. 1F-2CN, 2F-2CN, and 3F-2CN are among the -CN additives with different molecular dipoles that are created (1F-2CN: 2’-fluoro-[1,1’-biphenyl]-3,5-dicarbonitrile; 2F-2CN: 2’,6’-difluoro-[1,1’-biphenyl]-3,5-dicarbonitrile; 3F-2CN: 2’,3’,4’-trifluoro-[1,1’-biphenyl]-3,5-dicarbonitrile). Two -CN groups in the additives may coordinate the Pb2+ defects, and the F (fluorine) atoms may control the dipole moment of the additives by forming hydrogen bonds with the charged FA+ group. Additionally, the -CN additions may stitch the flaws at the grain boundaries and relieve the stress at the grain boundary, resulting in a lower Young’s modulus and greater mechanical flexibility. Furthermore, the additions may improve carrier extraction and transport while attenuating the interactions between the longitudinal optical phonons and the charge carriers. When compared to PSC with 1F-2CN and PSC with 3F-2CN, the flexible PSC with the 2F-2CN addition shows superior efficiency and stability due to its stronger molecular dipole. Thus, the PSC containing the 2F-2CN addition shows a high PCE of 24.08% (Table 6), strong stability (retention of 94% for 620 h by MPP tracking test), and excellent bending cycle stability for flexible solar cells (92% retention for 3000 bending cycles).

The utilization of halide-substituted ammonium salts can optimize the buried interface and the perovskite crystallization, eliminate the nanovoids at the interface for the fabrication of flexible PSCs on flexible plastic substrates. An et al.148 have utilized halide-substituted ammonium salts to optimize the buried interface and the perovskite crystallization to enhance the performance of flexible PSCs, where the halide-substituted ammonium salts are n-bromophenethylammonium (n-Br-PEAX; n = 2 or 4; X = Cl or Br). The speed of the crystallization process of perovskite can be altered by the rational design molecular structure of the ammonium salt, thereby generating a dense and homogenous morphology where nanovoids are absent at the interface. Hence, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 20.2% on flexible plastic substrates, while it exhibits high stability (87% retention for 290 h by MPP tracking test).

The utilization of in situ crosslinking-assisted perovskite grain growth strategy can enable the fabrication of mechanically robust flexible PSCs with high efficiency. Wu et al.149 have demonstrated mechanically robust flexible PSCs with high efficiency through in situ crosslinking-assisted perovskite grain growth. The bis((3-methyloxetan-3-yl) methyl) thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate (OETC) monomer is designed for regulating the growth of perovskite on plastic substrates. Thus, a perovskite film with a preferential crystal orientation, compact stacking, and enlarged grain size is obtained. Additionally, the mechanical stress can be effectively removed by the crosslinked elastomer polymer accumulated at the grain boundaries of the perovskite. Thus, after 2000 bending cycles (Radius: 5 mm), the SEM image of perovskite-crosslinking OETC film exhibits negligible fracture (Fig. 7c), but the SEM image of perovskite-MOTC film exhibits noticeable fracture (Fig. 7b), whereas the SEM image of pristine perovskite film exhibits severe fracture (Fig. 7a), suggesting the crosslinking OETC affords robust deformation stability, while the MOTC affords a partial deformation stability, but the pristine perovskite possesses poor deformation stability (MOTC: bis(3-methoxypropyl) thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate). As a result, the PSC with crosslinking OETC exhibits high bending cycle stability for flexible solar cells (93% retention for 5000 bending cycles (Fig. 7d)), and the PSC with crosslinking OETC exhibits high PCE of 23.4%, while it exhibits high stability.

Bifacial PSCs can harvest more solar illumination through two sides (front and rear surfaces; additional energy can be added through albedo light) than the one-side light harvesting of the monofacial PSCs, and that can enhance the energy conversion efficiency of the bifacial PSCs. Nevertheless, the design of the bifacial PSCs with high PCE and stability is a challenging task because of electrode corrosion and electrical loss in transparent rear contact, ion migration, and high rear side carrier recombination, while the components (such as the back contact electrode, perovskite layer, and transport layer) of the bifacial solar cells (making these as semi-transparent PSCs) need to be transparent to achieve high performance150,151. Thus, Jiang et al.77 have fabricated a transparent conducting rear electrode for bifacial single-junction PSCs (Fig. 7e) with inverted architecture using optical and electrical modeling to achieve high efficiency at different albedo illumination conditions. They have demonstrated that the bifacial PSCs have the capability to surpass their monofacial PSCs in terms of a lower levelized cost of energy and larger energy yields. As a result, the single-junction bifacial PSC exhibits a high PCE of 31.2% at an albedo of 0.5 (Fig. 7f), and the stabilized bifacial power output densities are 26.9 mW/cm2 under an albedo of 0.2, 28.5 mW/cm2 under albedo of 0.3, and 30.1 mW/cm2 under an albedo of 0.5 (Fig. 7g), while the bifacial PSCs exhibit the bifaciality of about 91% to 93%.

Various strategies for flexible PSCs, including molecular dipole engineering-assisted strain release76, utilization of halide-substituted ammonium salts148, and in situ crosslinking-assisted perovskite grain growth149, enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs. Fabrication of a transparent conducting rear electrode77 enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the bifacial PSCs.

Additive strategies for PSCs

Utilizing ammonium cations with a high pKa value of 12 as an additive can inhibit the deprotonation process when they react with FA+ in the perovskites at high-temperatures light soaking, and that can enhance the efficiency and stability of the PSCs at high-temperatures. Wang et al.63 have observed that the extensively used organic cations such as butylammonium (BA+) and phenethylammonium (PEA+) for 2D perovskites are unstable in formamidinium (FA+)-containing perovskites in light soaking at high-temperature. The BA+ and PEA+ deprotonate into amines at high-temperature light soaking, which subsequently react rapidly with FA+ to generate (butylamino)methaniminium (BAMA+) and (phenethylamino)methaniminium (PEAMA+), respectively. As a result, ammonia is produced, which generates damage to grain boundaries and perovskite interfaces and hampers the photostability of the PSCs at high-temperatures. Therefore, the photostability of the PSCs at high-temperatures can be enhanced by either removing BA+ and PEA+ cations from precursors or utilizing ammonium cations with high pKa (12.0), including BAMA+ and PEAMA+, because of the difficulty in deprotonation. Thus, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.1% (Tables 7), while it exhibits high stability (90% retention at 85 °C for ~1500 h) by MPP tracking test.

The cation compositional inhomogeneity exhibited due to A-site cation segregation can hamper the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with FA1-xCsxPbI3. The utilization of a suitable additive with a sulfone group can cause cation compositional homogeneity, and that could enhance the performance of PSCs. Liang et al.80 have identified the cause of the compositional inhomogeneity outside of the plane and its significant impact on PSCs. They envision this occurring along the vertical direction throughout perovskite films, where Cs aggregation is observed, preferably at the bottom of the film (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, the addition of 1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole (PSP; Fig. 8b) with a sulfone group homogenizes the distribution of cation content in perovskite films. As a result, the PSC shows a high PCE of 26.09% and a good level of stability (92% retention for 2500 h) according to the MPP tracking test. In situ synchrotron radiation grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) is conducted to determine the dual essential kinetic processes of phase transition and crystallization during the formation of perovskite. As shown in Fig. 8c, signals for a q vector of about 0.8 Å−1 can be ascribed to δ-phase perovskite of 2H (100), at about 0.82 Å−1 can be attributed to δ-phase perovskite of 6H (101), and 1.0 Å−1 can be assigned to α-phase perovskite. Two periods can be defined to investigate the kinetic processes. Period I is ascribed until the appearance of α-phase perovskite from the dripping of chlorobenzene (CB), where the crystallization rate is indicated by the duration of period I. Period II indicates the transition rate of δ- to α-phase, signifying the duration of stable α-phase formation. Thus, the in situ GIWAXS results disclose that both the phase transition and crystallization are accelerated by the introduction of PSP. The ‘out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity’ studies and in situ GIWAXS results disclose that the segregation of the Cs and FA phases can be efficiently inhibited by the PSP, where the slow rate of phase transition and crystallization are the potential kinetic factors leading to segregation of phase. The barrier energy (EB) for the perovskite phase change and crystallization is calculated thermodynamically using DFT calculations (DFT: Density functional theory), and the energy is then divided into the contributions from the Cs and FA components. The ΔEB = EBFA - EBCs defines the change in barrier energies. The mismatch factor μ = (EBFA - EBCs)/EBFA is calculated to determine more precisely the imbalance between the Cs and FA components. During period I, the ΔEB,I ref is 101.6 meV for the reference system (Fig. 8d), whereas the ΔEB,I PSP is only 35.3 meV for the PSP system (Fig. 8e), while the corresponding μ values are calculated to be 20.48% for μI,ref and only 5.34% for μI,PSP. At period II, ΔEB,II ref is 82 meV with μref is 12.49% for the reference system, but ΔEB,II PSP is only −6 meV with μPSP is only −1.79% for the PSP system. Thus, the PSP system exhibits lower μI and μII, which disclose that the variations in the phase transition and crystallization rates of the Cs and FA components are diminished, where the differences in the cations rates are possibly attributed to the observed delay through in situ GIWAXS. The potential reason for cation inhomogeneity may be attributed to the soft base characteristic of Cs cations compared to FA cations. This difference could lead to stronger interactions with PbI3−, resulting in a tendency for Cs to aggregate preferentially at the bottom. Moreover, the variation in the solubilities of FA and Cs species could partially be ascribed to inhomogeneity of cations.

Through extended X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (EXAFS), the adsorption spectra of the Pb LIII edge are obtained to determine the interactions of PSP with perovskite. A total of five grazing incidence angles are chosen in order to collect data at various perovskite film depths. The peaks at radial distances of about 2.2 Å and 2.9 Å, respectively, can be attributed to Pb-O and Pb-I coordination, as seen in Fig. 8f, g. A gradual downward shift of about 0.03 Å for the coordination of Pb-I is seen for the reference film (Fig. 8f) as the detecting depth is increased, suggesting that the lattice at the bottom of the perovskite has compressed. Nonetheless, the comparatively steady peaks linked to Pb-I coordination are detected subsequently to the addition of PSP, indicating the existence of cation inhomogeneity outside of the plane. When the depth is increased, an obvious shift in the higher radial distance for the Pb-O coordination is observed for the PSP film (Fig. 8g), suggesting the formation of a higher Pb-O coordination near the bottom of the film. Calculating the Pb-O coordination ratio of (Pb-O)/((Pb-O) + (Pb-I)) (Fig. 8h) reveals that Pb atoms in the PSP system typically coordinate with extra oxygen atoms toward the bottom of the perovskite film. Thus, it is hypothesized that there is a possible interaction between PSP and Pb atoms in perovskite due to the donation of electrons from the two oxygen atoms of the PSP.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements are performed on the as-synthesized (PbI2)x(PSP)y complex crystals to exactly determine the interaction of PSP with PbI2, where the peak at about 1328 cm−1 corresponds to asymmetric stretching vibration (νas), 1133 cm−1 corresponds to symmetric stretching vibration (νs) of the sulfone (O = S = O) group, and 964 cm−1 corresponds to symmetric stretching vibration (νs) of the sulfoxide (S = O) group. Moreover, all three characteristic peaks exhibit obvious shifts, suggesting the coordination between PSP and PbI2 by the sulfone (O = S = O) group (Fig. 8i). The νas and νs peaks exhibit upward shifts, which suggest that both oxygen atoms of the PSP can act as active sites, while the coordination between the O = S = O group and PbI2 is further confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, where the shifts in the carbon atoms nearby to the O = S = O group (nos. 14, 11, 6, 2, and 1) to a higher field are observed. These results corroborate the peak shifts detected through XPS measurements and the diminished PbI2 signal obtained through in situ GIWAXS tests.

Utilization of a suitable Lewis base additive can enhance the crystallinity and diminish the defect density and internal residual stress of the perovskite bulk, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. The quality of the bulk and surface of the FA0.98Cs0.02PbI3 perovskite film was improved by Chen et al.152 to diminish the efficiency gap. At first, a Lewis base additive (dibutyl sulfoxide) is used to enhance the crystallinity and diminish the defect density and internal residual stress of the perovskite bulk. Finally, the surface of the perovskite film is treated with trifluorocarbon-modified phenethylammonium iodide to optimize the energy levels and protect the film from moisture and passivate defects. Thus, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 25.1%, while it exhibits high stability (97.4% retention for 1800 h) according to the MPP tracking test.

The introduction of a non-volatile, multifunctional additive can alter the kinetics of the growth of the perovskite film via a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate phase, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Li et al.153 have utilized a non-volatile, multifunctional additive to alter the kinetics of the growth of the perovskite film via a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate phase. Thus, coherent grain growth and the generation of large perovskite grains from the bottom to the surface of the perovskite film are achieved, leading to considerably diminished non-radiative recombinations. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.8% and a low energy loss of 0.36 eV, while it exhibits high stability (90% retention for 500 h) by MPP tracking test, while the unencapsulated devices afford enhanced thermal stability with a T98 lifetime for >1000 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox under constant heating at 65 ± 5 °C.

The introduction of dimethylammonium chloride as an additive can modulate the perovskite intermediate precursor phases, which can modulate the grain size, orientation, crystallinity, and texturing of the perovskite system, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. McMeekin et al.154 utilized dimethylammonium chloride as an additive to modulate the perovskite intermediate precursor phases through a high-temperature dimethyl-sulfoxide-free processing route. Thus, the grain size, orientation (corner-up versus face-up), crystallinity, and texturing of the (FA)yCs1–yPb(IxBr1–x)3 perovskite system are modulated through controlling the sequence of crystallization. Hence, the PSC exhibits an unexpected PCE of 20.2% while it exhibits high stability (it exhibits 80% retention for 1190 h for steady-state power conversion efficiency and 80% retention for 1410 h at open-circuit conditions in air under simulated sunlight at 65 °C).

Excess lead iodide (PbI2) and abundant defects are commonly observed in perovskite films, where the PbI2 species can exhibit either a positive or negative effect on the PCE of the PSCs. The PbI2 layer with an ordered array structure can be obtained by integrating a suitable additive with nanoimprinting technology, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. He et al.155 have integrated a succinamide additive with nanoimprinting technology for the fabrication of a porous PbI2 layer with an ordered array structure. Thus, organic amine salts can be confined in PbI2 arrays to enhance omnidirectional diffusion and realize adequate conversion to perovskites. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 23.56% and high stability, while the module (14.63 cm2) exhibits a PCE of 16.42%.

The introduction of more hydrophobic π-conjugated aromatic additives can enhance the passivation and decrease the recombination, which can improve the stability and PCE of PSCs. Wang et al.156 have demonstrated the role of π-conjugated aromatic additives (CAAs) such as coumarin methacrylate (CMA) and coumarin hydroxyethyl (CHE) on the stability and PCE of PSCs using Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite. The additives are added to the precursor perovskite solutions, where CMA is more hydrophobic than CHE. Thus, the extent of passivation and binding to Pb2+ increase with an increase in hydrophobicity, leading to a decrease in recombination. As a result, the PSC with CMA exhibits a superior PCE of 21.28% than that of CHE (21.14%), while it exhibits high stability (including moisture and thermal stability).

The introduction of Zn(C6F5)2 as a molecular additive, and the utilization of dopant-free hole transport layer can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Mali et al.157 have demonstrated β–CsPbI3-Zn(C6F5)2 and γ–CsPbI3-GAI based phase-heterojunction all-inorganic PSC (n-i-p type) with high efficiency, where the β–CsPbI3-Zn(C6F5)2 was obtained by hot-air-processed and dimethylammonium iodide-assisted method, while the γ–CsPbI3-GAI was obtained by triple-source thermally evaporated method (GAI: guanidinium iodide). The Zn(C6F5)2 is used as a molecular additive, while the dopant-free hole transport layer is utilized. Therefore, the β − γ-based phase-heterojunction PSC and module exhibit enhanced PCE of 21.59% and 18.43% (18.08 cm2), respectively, while the PSC exhibits high stability (~90% retention for 200 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of hydrophobic additive with the hole transport layer can enhance the moisture resistance of the perovskite films, while integration of silica nanoparticles with suitable size and spacing with the perovskite films can retrieve the absorption loss induced by the lack of reflective metal electrodes, and that can enhance the performance of the bifacial perovskite minimodules. It has been shown by Gu et al.158 that the bifacial perovskite minimodules can add additional energy through albedo light, and their front efficiency is comparable to that of their opaque monofacial counterparts. A hydrophobic additive is introduced with the hole transport layer to enhance the moisture resistance of the perovskite films, while silica nanoparticles with suitable size and spacing are integrated with the perovskite films to retrieve the absorption loss induced by the lack of reflective metal electrodes. Under 1 solar illumination and 0.2 albedo, the small-area single-junction bifacial PSCs show a power-generation density of 26.4 mW cm−2. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 23.19% while it exhibits high stability. The bifacial minimodules exhibit >20% front efficiency, 74.3% bifaciality, and >23 mW cm−2 of power-generation density at an albedo of 0.2. The bifacial minimodule exhibits high stability (97% retention for >6000 h after light soaking under 1 sun at 60 ± 5 °C).

Utilization of suitable alkylthiol additive with the hole transport material can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Liu et al.159 have demonstrated a facile approach to introducing the 1-dodecanethiol (DDT, a low-cost alkylthiol additive) in the hole transport material (spiro-OMeTAD: 2,20,7,70-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,90-spiro bifluorene). Thus, a controllable, efficient doping process with efficient doping duration is achieved due to the DDT, which can provide comparable performance for hole transport material before air activation. The coordination of DDT with a lithium compound (LiTFSI) elevates the concentration of dopants in the bulk hole transport material, diminishes their accumulation at interfaces, and improves the structural integrity of the hole transport material at heat, wetting, and light stress. Consequently, the PSC demonstrates substantial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.6% and maintains robust stability, retaining 90% of its performance after 1000 h as verified by the maximum power point (MPP) tracking test.

The utilization of suitable additives, including additives with a sulfone group for perovskite80, Lewis base additives for perovskite152, a non-volatile, multifunctional additive for perovskite153, dimethylammonium chloride as an additive for perovskite154, the integration of succinamide additives with a nanoimprinting technology for perovskite155, π-conjugated aromatic additives for perovskite156, Zn(C6F5)2 as a molecular additive157, and the introduction of 1-dodecanethiol as an alkylthiol additive with the hole transport material159 enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Strategies associated with buried interfaces for PSCs

The main obstacles hindering the photovoltaic stability and performance of inverted PSCs are photochemical degradation and non-radiative recombination losses (trap-assisted) at the perovskite and charge-transport layers interface. Introduction of suitable additive into the precursor inks can tune the crystallization of perovskite, regulate the extraction dynamics and carrier recombination at the buried interface, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Li et al.64 have introduced a tiny quantity of 2-aminoindan hydrochloride into the precursor inks to tune the crystallization of methylammonium-free perovskite. Thus, the additive regulates the extraction dynamics and carrier recombination at the buried interface through the generation of a bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction (Fig. 9a, b). The PSC achieves a notable PCE of 25.12% overall (Fig. 9a, b) and a certified PCE of 24.60%, surpassing previously reported values for similar MA-free inverted PSCs (Fig. 9c). It maintains over 98% of its performance after 1500 h, as verified by MPP tracking tests (Table 8 and Fig. 9e).

Introduction of an amphiphilic molecular hole transporter with multifunctional group can produce a superwetting underlayer for the deposition of perovskite, and that can cause the formation of high-quality perovskite films with the fewest defects at the buried interface. Zhang et al.81 have demonstrated the (2-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid (MPACPA) containing a multifunctional cyanovinyl phosphonic acid group as an amphiphilic molecular hole transporter. This generates a superwetting underlayer for the deposition of perovskite, and that causes the formation of high-quality perovskite films with the fewest defects at the buried interface. As a result, the perovskite film exhibits 17% of photoluminescence quantum yield and about 7 microseconds of Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime, and the perovskite solar cell and minimodule exhibit high PCE of 25.16% (23.4% for 1 cm2) and 22.0% (10 cm2), respectively. The PSC exhibits robust stability (>90% retention for 2000 h) by MPP tracking test due to the encapsulated modules afford high stability at damp heat and operational test conditions. Electronic structure calculations by first-principles are conducted to determine the effect of passivation of MPACPA on typical deep-level defects generated on the surface of the perovskite grain, including lead-iodide antisite (PbI) and interstitial lead (Pbi) defects. Deep defective states are induced by Pbi and PbI within the band gap, and that could play as non-radiative recombination centers. The introduction of the MPACPA molecule significantly passivates the defective states of PbI and Pbi, causing them to migrate either within the conduction or valence bands or close to the band edges, as shown in Fig. 10b. Emerging chemical bonds were generated between N and Pb from the cyano group (Pb-N’) and between O and Pb from the phosphonic acid group (Pb-O’), as shown in Fig. 10a, leading to the formation of a complemented octahedral local chemical environment for Pb. The Pb-N’ bond length is calculated to be 2.47 Å, which is less than that of the experimentally determined Pb-N bond lengths (~2.58 to 2.75 Å) in lead acesulfamates, whereas the calculated Pb-O’ bond length of 2.68 Å is within the experimentally determined limit of ~2.484 to 2.914 Å. The calculated electron localization function results further confirm the chemical bond formation between Pb and O’ and N’ (Fig. 10c).

The synergistic effect of passivation through two types of bonds significantly enhances the thermodynamic stability of passivation sites, proving especially effective at mitigating deep-level defect states. As a result, the perovskite film on MPACPA exhibits 17% of the photoluminescence quantum yield in the half-stacks due to the decrease in non-radiative recombination at the buried interface. The XPS studies further confirm the interaction of CPA with Pb. The thermal admittance spectroscopy studies disclose the frequency dependent capacitance in PSCs with various hole transport layers. The MPACPA-based PSCs afford a lower apparent trap density of states (tDOS) at about 0.4 eV (Fig. 10d), which could be attributed to the lesser number of ionic charges or the reduction of electronic defects in perovskite.

Introduction of MACl as an additive can afford void-free perovskite-buried interface for scalable processing of perovskite solar modules. Hu et al.160 have demonstrated a void-free perovskite-buried interface for scalable processing of p-i-n-based perovskite solar modules (>10 cm2) with FAPbI3 as perovskite. The growth of the perovskite film is controlled by utilizing a moderate flow of N2 during vacuum-assisted growth, while the utilization of MACl as an additive hinders interfacial voids in blade-coated large-area perovskites. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 22.3%, while it exhibits high stability, while the scalable perovskite solar module with 12.25 cm2 of aperture area exhibits a high PCE of 18.3% with a geometric fill factor of 96.3%.

The utilization of interfacial ligand confinement strategy can provide top-contact passivation and improve the extraction of electrons at the electron selective contact, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Huang etal.161 have demonstrated the fabrication of finite 2D/3D hierarchical perovskite structures through interfacial ligand confinement to enhance the stability and efficiency of the inverted PSCs and modules. The generation of a finite and dense 2D layer is achieved due to the utilization of a diamine masking reagent atop the 3D perovskite layer, which can modulate cation exchange through hydrogen bonding, while this can provide top-contact passivation and improve the extraction of electrons at the electron selective contact. Hence, the PSC exhibits a remarkable PCE of 24.7% with high stability (>90% retention for 1000 h) according to the MPP tracking test.

The utilization of suitable amphoteric organic salt can modulate the energy level alignment and film morphology at the perovskite buried interface. Zhang et al.162 have utilized 2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethylammonium-4-methyl benzenesulfonate (4FPEAPSA) to modulate the energy level alignment and film morphology at the perovskite buried interface. The amphoteric organic 4FPEAPSA salt treatment enhances the growth of a coarse-grained, void-free, and hydrophobic film by inducing crystal orientation. Thus, the 4FPEAPSA with dual functionality can interact chemically with the perovskite film to passivate the formamidine vacancies and defects of iodine, returning the fermi level of perovskite to its defect-free state. Moreover, the interfacial charge extraction and transport of PSC can be enhanced by the generation of a p-type doping buried interface to attain diminished carrier recombination loss. This PSC exhibits a large PCE of 25.03% while it exhibits high stability.

Utilization of conductive and transparent oxide perovskite as ETL can afford high lattice matching, and obviate the generation of a deteriorated buried interface, which can provide less strain, less defects, high crystallinity, fewer voids, and suppress ion migration, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Luo et al.163 have utilized the SrSnO3 perovskite as ETL rather than using a passivator, where the SrSnO3 is a conductive and transparent oxide perovskite. Thus, a well-ordered beginning of the growth of perovskite on the ETL is achieved due to the high lattice matching, hindering the generation of a deteriorated buried interface. Hence, the buried interface affords reduced strain, less defects, high crystallinity, fewer voids, and suppressed ion migration. Consequently, the PSC exhibits an excellent PCE of 25.17%, and retain high stability (90% retention for 1000 h) according to the MPP tracking test.

Utilization of suitable surfactant on the surface of the TiO2 can diminish surface energy, enhance the carrier-extraction efficiency, relieve the compressive stresses at the buried interface, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Su et al.164 have utilized heptadecafluorooctanesulfonate tetraethylammonium (HFSTA) as a surfactant on the surface of the TiO2. The DFT calculations reveal that the generation of O vacancies is inhibited on HFSTA-TiO2, and that can diminish surface energy and enhance the carrier-extraction efficiency. The experimental studies disclose that the enhanced crystallization process and diminished heterogeneous nucleation sites enable the generation of good-quality perovskite films, while the compressive stresses at the buried interface are significantly relieved by the flexible long alkyl chains in HFSTA. Thus, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 25.03% due to the passivation of TiO2, stress relief, and modulation in the crystallization process, while it exhibits high stability (66% retention for 50 h) by MPP tracking test.

Utilization of a pre-embedding mixed A-cation halide strategy can enable the formation of the high-stable 3D perovskite from the residual unstable PbI2 near the buried interface, optimize the lattice strain of the perovskite near the buried interface, inhibit the detrimental δ phase formation from the α phase, and enhance the phase stability of the perovskite. Gao et al.165 have improved the stability of the PSC through utilizing a pre-embedding mixed A-cation halide strategy, where the high-stable 3D perovskite is formed from the residual unstable PbI2 near the buried interface. Thus, this strategy could optimize the lattice strain of the perovskite near the buried interface, inhibit the detrimental δ phase formation from the α phase, and enhance the phase stability of the perovskite. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.26%, while it exhibits high stability (94.7% retention for 1000 h) by MPP tracking test.

Strategies associated with buried interfaces including the utilization of suitable additives64,160, amphiphilic molecular hole transporter81, amphoteric organic salt162, conductive and transparent oxide perovskite as ETL163, suitable surfactant on the surface of the TiO2164, interfacial ligand confinement161, and a pre-embedding mixed A-cation halide strategy165, enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Strategies for ion migration for PSCs

Various strategies have been performed to retard the ion migration to enhance the performance of PSCs. Utilization of suitable material as iodine trapper can alleviate the ion migration, and that can enhance the stability of PSCs. Li et al.70 have utilized β-cyclodextrin as an iodine trapper to enhance the stability of PSCs. The iodine formed in perovskite can be trapped by β-cyclodextrin, and the bowl structure of β-cyclodextrin hinders the escape of iodine, where the trapped I2 can react with and consume Pb0 defects in perovskite films, further enhancing the stability of PSCs. Therefore, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 23.2%, while it exhibits high stability (∼90% retention for 1000 h (Table 9) under ISOSL-1 by MPP tracking test at 25 °C; ∼81.2% retention for 300 h under ISOSL-2 by MPP tracking test at 85 °C, where ISOS represents International summit on organic photovoltaic stability).

Substitution of lead with tin in perovskite can suppress the ionic transport, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Dey et al.166 have demonstrated that ionic transport is suppressed in halide perovskite optoelectronics due to the substitution of lead with tin. The scan-rate-dependent current-voltage investigations on mixed Pb-Sn and Pb PSCs disclose losses for short-circuit current at lesser scan rates in both kinds of perovskites, which can be traced to the existence of mobile ions. Temperature-dependent impedance spectroscopy measurements and scan-rate-dependent hysteresis analyses reveal that the ion migration in Pb-Sn PSCs is suppressed when compared to that of Pb perovskite solar cells. As shown in Fig. 11a–c, three distinct pathways for iodide ion migration are examined, which are labeled as A, B, and C, while the Fig. 11d depicts their corresponding energy profiles. The A, B, and C pathways for FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 and FASnI3 exhibit various orders of equatorial-axial type hops, where >0.9 eV of energy barriers for both perovskites and 1.45 eV for FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 and 1.12 eV for FASnI3 of rate-limiting ion migration energies for long-range diffusion are obtained. Thus, the simulations obviously suggest that the iodide migration adjacent to Sn vacancy defects in FASnI3 and FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 exhibits higher energy barriers of >1.1 eV when compared to that of Pb perovskites with <0.5 eV because of the severe local structural distortion of Sn vacancies, thereby diminishing halide ion mobility. The theoretical calculations and experimental investigations disclose that the Sn vacancies with local structural distortions in mixed Pb-Sn perovskite play a vital role in increasing the suppression of iodide ion migration.

Utilization of a supermolecule as a buffer layer at the interface of perovskite can enhance defect self-healing and inhibit ion migration, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Zhang et al.167 have utilized a supermolecule (starch-polyiodide) as a buffer layer at the interface of perovskite, and this bifunctional buffer layer can enhance defect self-healing and inhibit ion migration. Hence, the metastable dynamics of degradation in perovskites can be tuned by the supramolecular chemistry. Therefore, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.3%, and it exhibits high stability (92% retention for 1472 h by MPP tracking test; 98% retention for 42 diurnal cycles (12 h light/12 h dark cycle), while it exhibits intense electroluminescence with high external quantum efficiencies (>12%).

Introduction of suitable alkali metals can effectively control the ionic migration due to an electrostatic interaction with the organic compounds, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Aranda et al.168 have demonstrated the control of ionic migration in PSCs by alkali metals. Thus, the role of Na, Li, and K on the photovoltage of the MAPbBr3 (wide band-gap perovskite) is systematically examined by utilizing negative capacitance in impedance spectroscopy as a tool. Sodium cations inhibit adverse interfacial recombination pathways, and it exhibits a higher stabilized VOC of 1.65 V when compared to that of Li and K. Impedance studies disclose that the sodium substantially affects the material’s bulk, which is corroborated with the XPS and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry studies. These investigations reveal that the ionic migration is effectively diminished by Na in perovskite materials. The XPS studies disclose that Na effectively decreases the ionic migration in perovskite materials due to an electrostatic interaction with the organic compounds.

Utilization of bis-diazirine molecules can suppress the ionic migration due to the covalent bond formation with the organic cations of perovskites, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Liu et al.169 have utilized bis-diazirine molecules, where the organic cations of perovskites can be covalently bonded with bis-diazirine molecules to alleviate the escape of organic components from perovskites, and that can hinder adverse effects including more defects, organic vapors, and ion migration. Ab initio simulation and experimental investigations disclose that the bis-diazirine molecules effectively immobilize the organic cations, leading to an improvement in the illumination, thermal, and electrical bias resistance properties of perovskites. Hence, the PSC exhibits a large PCE of 23.95%, while it exhibits high stability (98.6% retention for 1000 h by MPP tracking test).

Introduction of a conformally bonded molecular interface can mitigate iodine migration and enhance the performance of PSCs. Yuan et al.170 have utilized a conformally bonded molecular interface to mitigate iodine migration and enhance the performance of PSCs. Thus, three linear molecules (L1, L2, and L3) with a D-A-D’-A-D structure as dopant-free HTMs are obtained by enlarging the indacenodithiophene π-bridge donor (D’) to merge with the benzothiadiazole acceptor (A) and methoxy triphenylamine donor (D). The intermolecular packing effect and intramolecular dipole effect are leveraged by the π-bridge extension with active sites for coordination, leading to a conformally bonded ultrathin interface with uniform and compact coverage (about 60 nm) to guard the buried perovskite and hinder iodine migration. Ultrafast laser spectroscopy investigations disclose that L-series molecules possess a sequential decline of photoexcited energy disorder to demonstrate the structure-performance-stability relationship. Hence, the n-i-p PSC with L3 (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/L3/MoO3/Au) exhibits a high PCE of 22.61%, while it exhibits high stability (>85% retention for 500 h at 85 °C by MPP tracking test).

Incorporating a cross-linked polymer between 2D and 3D perovskite can reduce the ionic diffusion, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Luo et al.82 have designed a 3D perovskite/cross-linked polymer/2D perovskite heterostructure to reduce the ionic diffusion between the surface 2D and bulk 3D perovskites by adding a cross-linked polymer to the top of a 3D perovskite layer and then depositing a 2D perovskite layer using a vapor-assisted two-step process. The heterostructure is sustained by the cross-linked polymer by delaying the diffusion of FA+ and 4F-PEA+ cations across the 2D and 3D perovskites, according to thickness-profiled elemental analysis and photoluminescence spectra (FA+: formamidinium; 4F-PEA+: 4-fluorophenylethylammonium). Consequently, the PSC has a high PCE of 21.2% and great stability (retention of 90% for 4390 h at 60 °C according to the MPP tracking test).

Strategies to retard ion migration, including the utilization of β-cyclodextrin as an iodine trapper70, a buffer layer (a starch-polyiodide supermolecule) at the perovskite interface167, alkali metals168, bis-diazirine molecules169, a conformally bonded molecular interface170, incorporating a cross-linked polymer between 2D and 3D perovskite82, and substitution of lead with tin in perovskite166 enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

HTL and ETL-related strategies for PSCs

Since the design of (opto)electronic devices resistant to heat is highly desirable, the formation of stable and compact semiconducting thin films is required. Nevertheless, developing solution-processable organic semiconductors with superior thermo-mechanical properties is a highly challenging task. Fang et al.65 have demonstrated that the organic semiconductors (obtained through solution-processable route) exhibit significantly high glass transition temperatures (>220 °C), which could be due to the selection of tribenzotriazatruxene with helical isomer instead of planar isomer as the conjugated core. Microscopic studies disclose that the integration of a non-planar helicene as the conjugated core with organic semiconductors can be solution processed into integral thin films and morphologically homogenous on several substrates, due to a remarkably enhanced solubility of >200 mg mL−1. Furthermore, the theoretical and experimental studies disclose that the helical tribenzotriazatruxene-based organic semiconductor exhibits considerably high water resistance and hole conduction, possibly due to the heightened molecular packing density. As a result, the n-i-p type PSC exhibits a high PCE of 23.9% (Table 10), and high stability (93% retention for 500 h) by MPP tracking test, and high long-term thermal stability at 85 °C.

Utilization of suitable spirobifluorene-based hole transport material containing an electron-donor can afford high glass transition temperature, and provide comparable HOMO energy level, and that can enhance the thermal stability and performance of the PSCs. Ren et al.171 have fabricated a spirobifluorene-based hole transport material containing an electron-donor of extremely asymmetric fluorenylcarbazolamine (SBF-FC) to achieve high thermal stability and efficiency in PSC. Thus, the SBF-FC exhibits a very high glass transition temperature, while it exhibits a comparable HOMO energy level when compared to that of spiro-OMeTAD. A composite is prepared by blending an 85:15 weight ratio of SBF-FC and 4-tertbutylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, while the composite exhibits a high conductivity of 49 mS cm−1 at room temperature and retains a high glass transition temperature of 176 °C. Furthermore, the PSC with SBF-FC based hole transport layer on a FAPbI3 thin perovski",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44296-025-00073-9/MediaObjects/44296_2025_73_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-09-06 06:59:28.072077

But Porsche has never done a front-biased all-wheel drive system in its nearly 40-year history of selling all-wheel drive cars.","Porsche is scrambling. Going fully electric with the Macan was a bold decision that came at the wrong time, as luxury EV demand faltered in the US and Europe, and Porsche sales essentially collapsed in China. Porsche won’t revive the gas-powered Macan, sadly, but the company is making a successor—and it's trying to do so cheaply and quickly.

Autocar reports that this new gas-powered SUV, codenamed ""M1,"" will be a twin to the new Audi Q5, which rides on that brand’s Premium Platform Combustion (PPC) architecture. The original Macan was a twin of the Q5, but Porsche spent a lot of money and effort reengineering the car to make it worthy of the Stuttgart crest. That included new V-6 engines and an entirely bespoke all-wheel drive system.

That won’t be the case for this coming SUV. Autocar says that the ""M1"" will use the same front-wheel-drive-based Quattro Ultra all-wheel drive system as the Q5 and other new Audi models. In the Q5, the system operates as front-wheel drive in most normal driving scenarios, but shifts torque rearwards when deemed necessary. It can send a maximum of 70 percent of engine torque rearwards, and in some models, Quattro Ultra employs an electronic rear differential that can bias torque across the axle.

It’s a more efficient system than the traditional Torsen-center-differential Quattro all-wheel drive, or the original Macan’s Porsche Traction Management, which always sent power to the rear. That’s good for helping hit the increasingly strict fuel-economy and emissions targets Porsche (and every other automaker) faces everywhere except the US these days.

Using Quattro Ultra is also cheaper and easier for Porsche. When confirming the ""M1"" project this past summer, Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said that the brand is aiming to develop this SUV in a relatively short three years.

And Porsche needs to save costs wherever it can. Taycan sales have fallen sharply, tariffs are hitting it hard in the US market, and Chinese customers are rejecting non-domestic brands like Porsche. The electric 718 Boxster and Cayman models are also significantly behind schedule and will be a tough sell when they arrive, as there doesn’t seem to be much of a market for electric sports cars.

But Porsche has never done a front-biased all-wheel drive system in its nearly 40-year history of selling all-wheel drive cars. It’s always gone for rear-drive bias for superior driving dynamics. The reality is that the ""M1 will still drive well thanks to ever-clever Porsche engineering, but it reflects just how much the fortunes have changed for a company that was once the envy of the entire auto industry.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/vx0Jw6/s1/porsche-macan-gts.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 07:59:53.413514

Campbell power plant, a local advocacy group is calling on Ottawa County to take control of the facility and create its own energy board.

The plant, originally scheduled to close in May, remains operational after the presidential directive. Current owner Consumers Energy has warned that keeping the plant open will likely result in higher utility bills for residents.

Ottawa County group pushes for local control of J.H. Campbell power plant

Joseph Parnell McCarter, volunteer leader of the group ""Save the Campbell,"" believes there's a way to keep the plant open without raising costs for consumers.

""Consumers Energy is very aggressive in terms of the net zero agenda, and so their strategy is to build more battery plants, solar fields,"" McCarter said. ""Those plans, which I think is an economic mistake, a mistake for our grid, and even an environmental mistake.""

McCarter is urging Ottawa County commissioners to pass a resolution requiring Consumers Energy to scale back its renewable energy efforts and explore contracts with AI data centers to keep the plant financially viable.

If Consumers Energy doesn't comply, McCarter suggests the county should consider taking control of the plant and establishing a countywide energy board.

""Our goal is to have a locally controlled electric that provides reliable, cost effective and environmentally responsible electric for us,"" McCarter explained.

County commissioners are divided on the proposal. Commissioner Joe Moss expressed support for exploring the idea.

""I definitely support an exploratory committee and I support the county being involved in general with that process,"" Moss said.

However, Commissioner Doug Zylstra, who voted against the original resolution to keep the plant open, opposes the new plan.

""I voted against the first resolution… I would also not be in favor of the Ottawa County board being involved in purchasing an aging coal plant,"" Zylstra said.

Zylstra questioned the economic viability of the proposal.

""The cost of production is the cost of production, and I think there are good reasons why consumers' energy is transitioning away from the Campbell plant,"" Zylstra said.

Despite acknowledging the challenges of creating a county-wide cooperative, Moss believes the board should examine the proposal.

""I think the board should definitely discuss it there have been ongoing discussions at the county level about the Campbell plant and energy policy in general,"" Moss said.

The county board has not announced whether it will formally consider the issue, though Zylstra indicated it could appear on a future agenda.

""The first resolution came fairly quickly, so it could happen that we take that up,"" Zylstra said.

But while attacking the ZEV mandate, the Conservative leader didn't say how he would reduce emissions from Canada's transportation sector.
The ZEV mandate is now officially under review.
It was implausible that the implementation of climate policy in Canada was ever going to be perfectly straightforward or without revision.","Mark Carney's announcement on Friday that implementation of the federal government's zero-emission vehicle mandate will be delayed by at least a year can be read as another retreat on climate policy from the new prime minister.

It can also be read as a small victory for Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who had been calling on the government to abandon the policy.

That was certainly Poilievre's own reading of events.

""Today he's flip-flopped.… He's finally admitted that the Conservatives were right, just like we were right on the carbon tax,"" Poilievre told reporters on Parliament Hill.

But, the Conservative leader lamented, it was a ""clumsy retreat,"" because the prime minister was merely promising to ""delay"" the mandate.

""Mark Carney can't even get his flip-flops right,"" Poilievre said.

In fact, Carney says the ZEV sales mandate will be subject to a 60-day review. And so, for now, it's not clear whether the mandate — a major policy meant to drive down greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector — is actually dead or merely sleeping.

But deliberations on the mandate, Carney said, will be part of a larger review aimed at designing a new ""climate competitiveness"" strategy — upon which a lot, both politically and practically is now riding.

How the ZEV mandate got squeezed

The electric vehicle availability standard — what has come to be known as the ZEV mandate — sets out a series of escalating sales targets for automakers in Canada. For next year, the target would have been 20 per cent.

As with the federal carbon tax that he scrapped in March, Carney could plead that he inherited a troubled policy. Under the previous prime minister, the federal government allowed its EV consumer rebate to expire in January and that likely contributed to a significant drop in sales. Environment Minister Julie Dabrusin said in June that the government was working on a new rebate program, but that may have only further dissuaded potential consumers from making immediate purchases.

American tariffs on the automotive sector then gave the industry another reason to ask for relief.

It's also fair to note that Canada is not the only country where a new government has decided to fiddle with its existing ZEV mandate — in the United Kingdom, a Labour government recently amended a mandate that was originally introduced by a Conservative government.

But the British government did still keep a mandate in place. Asked on Friday whether he would consider fully repealing Canada's ZEV mandate, Carney did not offer a categorical answer.

""We're using this as an opportunity, as part of a broader strategy on climate competitiveness, to look at all our measures to help get greenhouse gases down,"" he said. ""And we'll look at the interactions between the EV mandate, our clean fuel standards, our investment tax credits, our trade policy — all of those elements — because what this government is focused on is absolutely results.""

Can the mandate be saved?

There may be paths to amending the mandate without abandoning it.

""Today's announcement of a delay in application by one year and a broader review of the policy can be an opportunity to better meet its most important objectives: giving consumers choice and getting EVs into the hands of those who want them,"" Clean Energy Canada's Joanna Kyriazis said in a statement on Friday.

If a lack of incentives or charging infrastructure is part of what's standing in the way of Canada keeping pace with other countries — EVs accounted for 21 per cent of new car sales in the European Union last year — that might be all the more reason for the federal government to double-down on such efforts.

Clean Energy Canada has a number of other suggestions: giving carmakers credit for either selling vehicles below $40,000 or offering zero-interest financing, adopting European safety standards to allow for the sale of a great variety of vehicles or, perhaps most controversially, lowering tariffs on Chinese-made EVs.

The Pembina Institute similarly said the government's options include ""extending credits for plug-in hybrid vehicle and charging infrastructure, modestly adjusting targets or re-evaluating tariffs on Chinese-made EVs.""

In his remarks on Friday, Carney said the government would ""advance new options to bring more and more affordable electric vehicles to Canadians."" But he declined to speculate on whether that might include reducing tariffs on Chinese EVs.

On Parliament Hill, Poilievre said he disagreed with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, who has called for Canada to drop those tariffs (retaliatory tariffs by China are punishing Saskatchewan's canola industry).

But while attacking the ZEV mandate, the Conservative leader didn't say how he would reduce emissions from Canada's transportation sector. Asked directly on Friday what he would do, Poilievre answered by saying he would aim to help other countries reduce their emissions.

What will Carney's climate strategy include?

Carney came to politics with a reputation for — and a track record of — putting his energy and time toward the cause of combatting climate change. Until January, he was the UN's special envoy on climate action and finance. In his book, Value(s), he wrote extensively about the challenge and on Friday he said combatting climate change was both a ""moral obligation"" and an imperative for global competitiveness.

But his first act as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon tax. The ZEV mandate is now officially under review. And the future of the proposed cap on emissions from the oil and gas sector is also uncertain.

""More than four months after its election, and in the wake of a destructive summer of climate change-driven drought, wildfires and smoke affecting millions of Canadians, the federal government has provided limited information about its intentions on climate policy,"" Rick Smith, president of the Canadian Climate Institute, said in a statement on Friday.

It was implausible that the implementation of climate policy in Canada was ever going to be perfectly straightforward or without revision. And it is still possible to knit together an ambitious climate agenda without policies like a carbon tax or a cap on oil and gas emissions.

Carney has said he would maintain and enhance the carbon-pricing benchmarks for industrial emissions and one of the criteria guiding the government's selection of ""nation-building"" infrastructure projects is ""contribut[ing] to clean growth and to meeting Canada's objectives with respect to climate change.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7626806.1757109833!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/carney-tariffs-20250905.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-06 06:59:23.489033

Greater Washington Region Clean Cities Coalition (GRWCCC) hosted the event, the latest installment in a series of job fairs they have organized in the Washington, D.C., metro area. To GWRCCC, job fairs are a critical way to provide connections that lead to employment opportunities. The job fairs bring a sense of confidence and positivity for people impacted by unemployment.

When GRWCCC first started hosting the job fairs in 2022, they focused on employers that could provide jobs in the clean energy and transportation sectors. This year, the coalition concentrated on quality, long-term, and sustainable employment opportunities that can support people struggling with unemployment.

“Bringing community members who are experiencing hardship to employers with quality jobs and making that process inviting is important,” said Association Manager Kimberly Harden, who supports event planning at GWRCCC and organizes the job fairs.

For the Baltimore fair, Greater Paradise Christian Center converted its sanctuary into a space for job seekers, the majority between 18 and 40 years old, to visit 17 employers who offered onsite interviews, job listings, and information about available positions. Job seekers also visited professional coaches and recruiters. Many employers in attendance were nonprofits and government agencies, including the state of Maryland, Job Corps, Maryland Environmental Service, the National Guard, and a solar company, in addition to entities that provided job training.

GWRCCC is one of more than 75 U.S. Department of Energy-designated Clean Cities and Communities coalitions across the country. These coalitions work to deploy affordable and efficient transportation fuels, energy efficient mobility systems, and other cost-saving technologies and practices.

GWRCCC’s mission involves creating networks of local stakeholders and providing technical assistance to implement alternative and renewable fuels, idle-reduction measures, fuel economy improvements, and emerging transportation technologies. The networks and connections that come with this work make the coalition uniquely suited for its role as a community connector. GWRCCC brings resources directly to those who need them most and ensures that environmental benefits are also economic benefits.

“We don’t have the bandwidth to provide customized support to individuals in the communities we serve, but we can connect people in underserved communities with these opportunities and help provide motivation and inspiration through informational resources,” Harden said.

By connecting job seekers and employers, GWRCCC is creating multifaceted relationships that benefit all involved. These relationships bring extra quality and commitment to their job fairs through dependable, valuable employment opportunities, and community-based organizations spread the word, putting opportunities and connections within reach.

GWRCCC often works with partner organizations and other free or low-cost event spaces to host job fairs, and the coalition provides informational flyers for the events. In some cases, professional coaches continue working with potential employees after the job fairs to connect them with opportunities that match their skillsets and experience. One employer held an informational entrepreneurial conference during a fair to share ideas for making money while looking for employment. Miss Maryland also attended the July fair, promoting the event live from a video on the GRWCCC Facebook page.

The coalition’s definition of success isn’t simply hosting a fair. While some employers report how many inquiries they received from the job fair, the coalition often hears about the success of their job fairs from networking events and other interactions with stakeholders and board members. A local employer thanked GWRCCC for the opportunity and reported that they received great prospects.",https://www.act-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/job-fair.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 06:59:34.498397

The cuts affect Rivian’s sales and service operations in both the U.S. and Canada.

This restructuring comes in a tense context. The end of the $7,500 USD federal tax credit, scheduled for September 30, is expected to cause a sharp slowdown in electric vehicle sales starting in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Rivian bets big on smaller R2

After launching the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV, Rivian is now readying to introduce the R2, a midsize electric SUV to be offered starting at $45,000 USD. Its mandate is to reach a broader customer base and compete directly with the Tesla Model Y, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5.

To prepare for production of the R2, Rivian will temporarily close its factory for three weeks in September 2025 to install a new assembly line dedicated to the model.

GM and VW also curb their ambitions

Rivian is not the only company rethinking its plans in the face of expiring federal credits and a market slowdown.

General Motors will temporarily suspend EV production at its Spring Hill, Tennessee, plant for several weeks this fall. This measure will notably affect the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq.

For its part, Volkswagen announced last week a slowdown in production of the all-electric ID.4 at its Chattanooga plant. That will entail a temporary layoff of 160 employees at the end of October. According to the manufacturer, this is a “market-driven decision” to adjust production volumes to demand.

An unfavorable economic context

The end of the tax credits, combined with the rising cost of raw materials and pressure from tariffs, is complicating the profitability of EVs for manufacturers.

Rivian recorded a net loss of $1.1 billion USD in the second quarter of 2025. The company expects to deliver between 40,000 and 46,000 vehicles by the end of the year, a decrease from the 51,579 units delivered in 2024.

Price hikes on the horizon

Rivian has already slightly increased its prices for 2026: the R1T starts at $72,885 USD and the R1S at $78,885 USD (fees included). The disappearance of the federal tax credit will make high-end EVs less attractive. Rivian hopes to attract a wider audience with the more accessible price of the R2, but the competition is set to be fierce.

The current slowdown in the EV market is not a simple accident: it reflects the limits of demand in a context where government incentives are disappearing. Rivian, GM, and Volkswagen are adjusting their strategies to navigate this period of uncertainty by betting on more affordable models better suited to actual demand.",http://picolio.auto123.com/auto123-media/articles/2025/9/73167/2026-rivian-r2-002afr.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 13:02:26.716390

Why Offshore Wind Matters—Right Now Our world is changing faster than ever.
From AI to data centers to the electrification of everything, we need more power—and we need clean power.

A Call to Action Offshore wind isn’t just an energy answer—it’s part of a moral calling.","When you meet environment, energy and offshore wind leader Jen Brock, you’re struck by her warmth—her smile, her thoughtful listening, her deep smarts. But beneath that engaging presence lies formidable grit: decades of advocacy, coalition-building, and real-world change. Now, as Chief Development Officer at Oceantic Network, this Jewish mom (who is proud to report that her daughter just had a bat mitzvah) stands at a critical crossroads—playing a leading role in the charge for offshore wind in a time when clean energy is under direct assault.

Why Offshore Wind Matters—Right Now

Our world is changing faster than ever. Climate shocks—extreme heat, floods, fires—are becoming the new normal. At the same time, our demand for reliable, affordable energy is skyrocketing. From AI to data centers to the electrification of everything, we need more power—and we need clean power.

Offshore wind is already delivering; with multiple projects under construction, this industry is poised to provide nearly 6 GW—enough to power over 1.4 million homes—before the decade’s end. In my home state of Maryland, where I serve as a Climate Commissioner, voters overwhelmingly support it—not just for environmental justice but because offshore wind can stabilize energy prices and deliver real economic benefits.

Politics and Pushback: The Trump Administration’s Attack

Yet that progress is being threatened. The Trump administration has ramped up a targeted assault on offshore wind beyond the Executive Memorandum issued on the President’s first day in office—issuing stop-work orders, freezing funding, and even trying to vacate permits for fully approved projects.

• In Rhode Island and Connecticut, Revolution Wind—80% complete and designed to power 350,000 homes—has been halted by a federal order citing vague “national security” concerns. The project’s owner, Ørsted, and two states have sued in response.

• The administration is also seeking to revoke approval for the New England and South Coast Winds projects. The Massachusetts project alone is projected to serve up to 900,000 homes.

• In Maryland, the US Wind project near Ocean City—a hard-won victory after years of development and permitting review—is now under legal threat as the administration moves to rescind that permit.

Oceantic leaders have been vocal in response. Sam Salustro, SVP at Oceantic, called it “a devastating assault on U.S. workers and businesses,” warning that revoking permits “after years of review will raise electricity prices for millions, jeopardize billions in private investment, and unravel a domestic $25 billion supply chain across 40 states.” And CEO Liz Burdock signed a legal declaration, under ACE NY, in support of the 17 states Attorneys General lawsuit challenging the legality of the Executive Memorandum. The filing delivered hard evidence of the economic damage inflicted—including staff layoffs, stranded assets, and lost or unrealized revenue—because the “President is not a fan of wind.”

This is not a theoretical fight. It’s a political blitz—and one that demands collective action.

Jen Brock: Leading with Heart and Resolve

This is where Jen Brock’s warmth and grit becomes invaluable. Whether she’s shepherding a Maryland business through Oceantic’s accredited market entry coaching program, managing cross-functional clean energy initiatives, or standing up for U.S. supply chain jobs, she does it with poise and urgency.

Her recent work—like advocating to protect US Wind’s permit in Maryland’s courts—is about more than policy. It’s personal. Brock celebrated her daughter Dylan’s Bat Mitzvah on May 4, 2024, where Dylan delivered a D’var Torah blending Star Wars with climate action—“May the Fourth be with you,” she proclaimed—reminding us that these struggles are about our kids and their futures.

I was with Brock recently at a major conference for County officials from Maryland. I watched her work with union leaders, environmental activists and our governor, Wes Moore. Thankfully, Moore is supporting the expansion of clean energy.

We Must Push Harder

With mounting threats—halted projects, pulled funding, and political roadblocks—anyone who cares about clean, affordable energy must dig in harder. We need to elevate voices like Brock’s: solution-driven, people-focused, and unafraid to stand up for what’s right.

As demand surges—from AI platforms to homes and factories—offshore wind is a scalable, reliable, prove solution that is cost-competitive and can be deployed relatively rapidly compared to nearly all other energy sources today. It can grow our clean energy capacity, lower costs, and protect our shared environment—if it’s allowed to proceed.

A Call to Action

Offshore wind isn’t just an energy answer—it’s part of a moral calling. In Jewish tradition, tikkun olam—repairing the world—demands more than words; it demands action. Jen Brock’s leadership shows us what that looks like: bold, grounded, smart, and unstoppable.

Let’s rally behind leaders like her—because the time is now. Whether through policy advocacy, public support, or simply spreading the word: the fight is real, the stakes are high, and we must act with both charm and grit to win.",https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/blogs/uploads/2025/09/Jen-Brock-speaks-with-Maryland-Governor-Wes-Moore-and-Marylands-First-Lady-Dawn-Flythe-Moore-about-offshore-wind.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 11:01:15.055015

Of those, 14 have completed construction and are generating swine gas, or able to.","The Trump administration has cancelled a $417,000 federal grant that would have funded research on the social and economic impacts of biogas production from industrialized swine operations in North Carolina.

Over several years, scientists from RTI International in Durham and the Gillings School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill had planned to continuously monitor the air, and periodically sample rivers, streams, and private drinking water in Duplin and Sampson counties. The study would also have collected health data in the communities.

Duplin and Sampson rank first and second in the nation, respectively, in the number of swine farms, according to a University of Michigan study. They account for 4.2 million hogs on roughly 900 farms, state environmental data shows, a small percentage of which have received state permits to produce biogas.

Census data show tracts near these concentrated animal feeding operations—CAFOs—are predominantly Black, Indigenous or Latino.

The research is important because swine gas operations are proliferating in North Carolina. Yet there is scant data on the environmental and health effects near these facilities, according to the RTI and UNC scientists.

The community research conducted in Duplin and Sampson counties on the biogas production project was sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and National Institute of Environmental and Health Sciences (NIEHS).

The biogas study was one of at least 1,700 projects that lost funding earlier this year after the Trump administration terminated $783 million in grants at NIEHS’ parent agency, the National Institutes of Health. Although it is unclear if the biogas study was singled out for its environmental justice focus , similar projects were targeted.

The U.S. Supreme Court last month upheld the administration’s cuts by a 5-4 vote. A lower court judge had blocked the cancellations on the grounds that they were discriminatory.

The North Carolina scientists, led by Crystal Lee Pow Jackson, had conducted one round of private well sampling and collected initial air quality data, but had yet to sample near an active swine gas operation when the Trump administration canceled the grant.

“We couldn’t complete the full research but there is valuable baseline data in this,” said Courtney Woods, an associate professor in UNC’s Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering. She also leads programs at the university in Environment, Climate and Health and Health Equity and Social Justice.

Major pork producers tout biogas as a solution to the industry’s methane problem. In 2018, swine manure emitted 970,000 tons of methane nationally, federal data show, second only to dairy.

Methane is short-lived in the atmosphere, but it inflicts more damage to the climate than carbon dioxide. Over 20 years, methane is 86 times more potent at warming the planet than CO2, which remains in the atmosphere for centuries.

Swine CAFOs generate biogas by capping waste lagoons, capturing the methane they emit and injecting the gas into a pipeline. Some CAFOs use the gas to power farm operations.

Yet the industry’s position doesn’t account for pipeline leaks. And in North Carolina, swine biogas systems still pump extra feces and urine into a second open-air lagoon; from there, the waste is sprayed on fields as fertilizer. Fecal contamination can seep into the groundwater and private drinking water wells from the spraying; methane, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from the lagoons still enter the air, unabated.

Align RNG, a partnership between Dominion Energy and Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork producer, receives swine gas from a half dozen CAFOs in Sampson and Duplin counties, according to state records from 2024. The farms ship their gas through 30 miles of low-pressure pipelines to Align RNG’s upgrading facility near Warsaw, a small town off Interstate 40 in Duplin County.

Align RNG did not respond to an email summarizing Inside Climate News’ reporting and inviting comment.

The upgrading plants are necessary because swine gas has a different chemical composition than gas derived from fossil fuels. Constituents such as hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen,ammonia and carbon dioxide must be removed before the gas can be injected into a traditional pipeline. These “tail gases” are scrubbed of hydrogen sulfide and burned in an enclosed flare.

Once the swine gas is upgraded, Align RNG injects it into a nearby pipeline owned by Piedmont Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Duke Energy, which uses it to generate electricity.

Align RNG estimates as many as 19 swine CAFOs could eventually ship their gas to the plant in Warsaw. Kraig Westerbeek, then-vice president of Align RNG, told the state Division of Air Quality in 2020 that the participating farms would reduce their collective methane emissions each year by 150,000 tons, measured as carbon dioxide equivalent. CO2 equivalent is a unit of measurement that standardizes the global warming potential of different greenhouse gases.

The company plans to build a second upgrading plant near Bowdens, also in Duplin County. It would accept gas from as many as 35 swine CAFOs, according to the Align RNG website. Construction is expected to finish by late 2026. The company has yet to apply for an air permit, according to a state database.

State records show that there are 55 swine CAFOs with biodigester permits. Of those, 14 have completed construction and are generating swine gas, or able to. Another 41 have yet to notify the state that they’ve finished construction. The state is reviewing permit applications for another 30 farms.

Since 2012, Duke Energy, municipal utilities and electric cooperatives have been legally required to generate or source a small percentage, up to 0.2 percent, of their prior year’s total retail electricity sales from swine waste.

However, the N.C. Utilities Commission has delayed its implementation because “the technology of power production from swine waste continues to face challenges and that swine waste-to-energy projects continue to experience operational difficulties,” a commission report from 2020 reads.

Blakely Hildebrand, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, filed a civil rights complaint with the EPA Office of External Rights Compliance four years ago over the biogas permits. The law center submitted the complaint on behalf of its clients, the Duplin County NAACP and the North Carolina Poor People’s Campaign.

The complaint alleged that, in issuing the biogas permits, the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality discriminated against Black and Latino residents in eastern North Carolina because the facilities had a disparate, harmful impact on those communities.

Since 2022, SELC and the state have been negotiating to resolve some of the allegations, Hildebrand said.

“We’ve not yet resolved the complaint,” Hildebrand said, “and the Trump administration has taken several steps to undermine civil rights law and environmental justice policy.”

In the spring, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants. In late August, the EPA fired more than two dozen remaining staffers in the now-defunct Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month it would stop funding wind and solar power installations on farmland.

The biogas conditioning plants are also sources of pollution. Align RNG’s Warsaw plant could emit 64 to 220 tons of pollutants each year, according to the company’s air quality permit.

Sulfur dioxide accounts for more than 75 percent of the potential emissions produced during biogas processing. Short-term exposure to sulfur dioxide can harm the respiratory system and make breathing difficult, according to the EPA. People with asthma, particularly children, are sensitive to these effects.

Precise figures from the upgrading facility aren’t publicly available because Align RNG doesn’t have to file an emissions inventory until 2028, state records show.

Earlier Air and Water Testing

RTI and UNC scientists presented limited results from their study in August in Sampson County at a meeting of EJCAN, an environmental and social justice group in Clinton. The preliminary data reflected the baseline environmental conditions because the biogas project is not in full operation, an RTI spokesperson said.

All of the 11 surface water sampling sites tested before the grant cancellation contained total coliform and E. coli bacteria at least once. In some cases, levels of E. coli exceeded state surface water standards.

(The N.C. Department of Environmental Quality currently uses fecal coliform as an indicator, but is switching to E. coli to align with EPA methods.)

Levels of nitrite, ammonia and nitrate concentrations were below surface water standards. However, phosphorus, which can supercharge harmful algal blooms, peaked at more than 30 times the levels at which algae could begin to multiply.

One-time air monitoring outside 13 homes within two miles of swine CAFOs, also conducted prior to the grant cancellation, detected nitrogen dioxide below National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

The scientists also found ammonia and hydrogen sulfide at similar levels reported by other studies in North Carolina, although there are no state standards for those compounds in for community ambient air. There were brief spikes of fine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, at unhealthy levels for a few hours, said Seung-Hyun Cho, the air monitoring project leader.

The scientists wanted to survey more community members about their views on swine gas operations, as well as the state of their physical and mental health. Yet despite the study’s limitations, residents were able to participate in the research, itself a valuable exercise. “We successfully engaged the community in environmental monitoring,” Courtney Woods, the UNC associate professor and researcher, said.

Most of the participants weren’t aware of the swine gas operations, Woods said. But they were concerned about persistent odor, health impacts and emotional stress of living near CAFOs in general.

While those surveyed said the hog industry provided economic benefits, Woods said, “they wanted clear answers on health impacts.”

The deleterious health impacts of living near swine CAFOs—even those without biodigesters—have been well documented. A University of Michigan study released last month found that census tracts near these facilities had 11 percent higher levels of PM 2.5 than those tracts without them, even when accounting for urban and industrial sources.

Epidemiologists have found that exposure to elevated levels of PM 2.5 is linked to asthma, cardiovascular disease, bronchitis, leukemia and Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers at the American Medical Association have found increases in overall death rates, heart attacks and lung cancer corresponding with increases in PM 2.5 levels. These health effects have been observed in residents as far as 11 miles from the farms.

Julia Kravchenko, an assistant professor of surgery and of population health sciences at Duke University, discovered similar trends in 2018. North Carolina communities located near hog CAFOs had higher all-cause and infant mortality, deaths due to anemia, kidney disease, tuberculosis, septicemia, and higher hospital admissions of low-birth-weight infants, Kravchenko found, but the study did not establish causality.

The Trump administration’s cancellation of the grant hampers the public’s ability to scrutinize the burgeoning industry. “I think communities have a right to know how their health is going to be affected,” Hildebrand, of the SELC, said. “And regulators need to know that as well, so that they can put protections in place to keep the environment safe and to ensure that the people who live near these facilities are kept safe as well.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/t4i6348.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 06:02:42.635951

Bottom Line If clean energy tax credits are important to your business, evaluate your ownership, financing and supply chain structures.","The U.S. government has been steadily tightening rules relating to who can benefit from clean energy incentives. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) is the latest step, and it makes one thing crystal clear: if your company has ties to certain foreign governments, your access to federal tax credits could be at risk and you should carefully consider the source of any debt financing. Here is what you need to know.

Who Gets Blocked from Tax Credits?

The OBBBA introduced several new entity categories, all under the umbrella term “prohibited foreign entity” (PFE), which are barred from obtaining clean energy tax credits. A PFE is either a—

Specified Foreign Entity (SFE), which includes:

Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOCs),

Chinese military companies,

Entities on national security watchlists, and

Foreign-Controlled Entities (FCEs)—entities owned or controlled by, or with sufficient ties to, a “covered nation” (i.e., North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran).

Foreign-Influenced Entity (FIE), which refers to companies where SFEs hold significant influence, such as:

Large ownership stakes,

Debt holdings, and

Contracts that effectively let the SFEs steer operations.

Notably, an entity is an FIE if at least 15% of its debt is issued, in the aggregate, to one or more SFEs (the “15% debt threshold”).

An organization can be labeled an FEOC if it is:

on a terrorism or sanctions list,

named on the U.S. Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list,

owned, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a government of a “covered nation,”

accused by the Attorney General of involvement in a serious crime, or

determined to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to national security or foreign policy.

Even partial ownership, voting rights, grants, debt, or board seats can be enough to trigger concern

If your business is an SFE or FIE, you will not be eligible for clean energy tax credits.

Which Tax Credits Are Affected?

Starting in 2025, restrictions kick in for a wide range of incentives, including credits for:

Nuclear power generation (45U)

Clean electricity (45Y, 48E)

Manufacturing clean energy components (45X)

Clean fuel production (45Z)

Carbon capture and storage (45Q)

Some bans began immediately upon enactment of OBBBA, while others phase in by 2027. Additionally, credits cannot be transferred or sold to SFEs, and harsher penalties are imposed for misstatements of tax liability due to disallowed credits under the PFE rules.

Why This Matters for Financing?

As noted, it is not just about ownership—financing and supply chain ties matter too. If your company uses loans or financing from an SFE, that alone can disqualify your company from tax credits (i.e., if you become an FIE).

On the debt capital markets front, we have been receiving queries from underwriters working with issuers in the energy and utility sector concerning the 15% debt threshold and its potential impact on debt securities offerings. For instance, underwriters are exploring whether and to what extent they can avoid placing with or reselling notes to, SFEs as well as the practical implications of implementing or monitoring compliance. Issuers, on the other hand, are exploring seeking additional or stronger representations from underwriters that no distributions of securities will be made by them to SFEs or FIEs either altogether or in excess of the 15% debt threshold. In one transaction we are aware of, the terms of the securities gave the issuer the right to redeem bonds at 101% upon a “Tax Credit Event” which was defined as any time in the reasonable determination of the issuer that payment of interest under the bonds would result in the issuer being unable to utilize its tax credits. It will be interesting to see how the market develops to tackle these issues and whether any regulatory relief or clarification will be forthcoming.

Bottom Line

If clean energy tax credits are important to your business, evaluate your ownership, financing and supply chain structures. Affected borrowers and lenders may include contractual language in loan or credit agreements addressing these issues and underwriters in bond offerings may need to explore ways (e.g. contractually and/or operationally) to avoid selling (or limit sales of) securities to certain foreign lenders.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15924_5512.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 11:01:19.225222

As the EU accelerates its transition away from Russian hydrocarbons, the U.S. energy sector stands to gain significant opportunities—but also faces risks tied to infrastructure constraints, policy alignment, and geopolitical tensions.

Market Dynamics: A New Era for Global Energy Flows

The EU’s REPowerEU initiative, launched in 2022, has already reduced Russian gas imports from 45% in 2022 to 19% in 2025, despite a 18% rebound in 2024 driven by liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline deliveries [1]. By 2028, the EU aims to fully phase out Russian oil and gas, a timeline reinforced by legal proposals to ban new contracts for Russian energy and address “shadow fleets” evading sanctions [5]. This transition creates a vacuum that the U.S. is positioning itself to fill.

U.S. LNG exports to the EU surged to $12.2 billion in 2024, with the U.S.-EU trade agreement committing the EU to purchase $750 billion in energy resources (including LNG, oil, and nuclear fuel) over three years [2]. However, analysts question the feasibility of this target, citing U.S. export capacity limits and the EU’s parallel push for renewables. For instance, U.S. LNG terminals operate near full capacity, and expanding infrastructure requires years of investment [4]. Meanwhile, the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive aims to boost renewables to 42.5% of energy consumption by 2030, potentially reducing long-term demand for fossil fuels [1].

Geopolitical Risks: Fragmentation and Strategic Dependencies

The EU’s phase-out plan is not without internal friction. Hungary and Slovakia, which rely on Russian crude via the Druzhba pipeline, have resisted the 2028 timeline, arguing it would destabilize energy prices [3]. This resistance highlights the risk of fragmented implementation, which could delay the EU’s energy independence and create market volatility. Additionally, the end of Ukrainian gas transit in 2025—a route accounting for half of Russia’s pipeline exports to the EU—has shifted geopolitical risks to Central and Eastern Europe, where countries like Austria and Hungary face supply disruptions [3].

For U.S. investors, these dynamics underscore the importance of diversifying energy partnerships. While the U.S. has become the EU’s largest LNG supplier (46% of European LNG imports in 2024 [2]), overreliance on U.S. fossil fuels could clash with the EU’s decarbonization goals. Eurelectric Secretary General Christian Rubi has warned that prioritizing LNG over renewables could undermine the EU’s strategic autonomy and divert resources from critical clean energy infrastructure [4].

U.S. Energy Sector Opportunities: LNG, Renewables, and Policy Alignment

Despite challenges, the U.S. energy sector is strategically positioned to benefit from the EU’s transition. U.S. LNG producers like Cheniere Energy are expanding export terminals, with projects in Louisiana and Texas aiming to double capacity by 2027 [2]. Similarly, renewable energy firms such as NextEra Energy are capitalizing on EU investments in clean power technologies, aligning with Europe’s sustainability goals [2].

The U.S.-EU trade agreement also includes provisions for nuclear energy collaboration, with U.S. firms like Westinghouse and NuScale vying to supply reactors to the EU [1]. However, the Trump administration’s rollback of climate policies—such as withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and easing methane regulations—poses risks. These moves could create a policy misalignment with the EU, which has maintained its climate commitments, including the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) [5].

Policy Alignment and Investment Returns

The alignment of U.S. and EU policies will be critical in shaping returns for energy investments. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has spurred U.S. cleantech manufacturing, but Trump-era deregulation and tariffs on solar and wind components have slowed renewable growth [3]. This divergence could limit the EU’s ability to source clean energy from the U.S., favoring domestic or Asian suppliers instead.

Conversely, U.S. companies that pivot toward renewables and carbon capture technologies—such as Occidental and Plug Power—stand to gain from EU green energy partnerships. A 2025 Oxford Sustainable Finance Group report estimates that €811 billion in renewable investments could replace Russian gas in the EU by 2028, offering long-term opportunities for U.S. firms with scalable clean energy solutions [4].

Conclusion: Strategic Value and Geopolitical Realities

The EU’s 2028 Russian oil exit is a pivotal moment for global energy markets, with the U.S. energy sector at the center of both opportunity and risk. While LNG exports and nuclear partnerships present immediate gains, the long-term viability of these investments depends on infrastructure expansion, policy alignment, and the EU’s renewable transition. Investors must also navigate geopolitical uncertainties, including EU member state resistance and U.S. policy shifts under Trump.

For U.S. energy companies, the key to success lies in balancing short-term fossil fuel exports with long-term clean energy partnerships. As the EU’s energy landscape evolves, those who adapt to decarbonization and geopolitical realities will be best positioned to capitalize on this transformative era.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 08:00:15.134424

Portland General Electric and its partner Mitsubishi Power have quietly shelved a planned hydrogen production, storage and hydrogen-fueled generation complex near Boardman, Oregon.

“Given the exit of an essential project partner in June, along with challenging project economics for utility customers and federal policy changes, PGE is no longer pursuing” the hydrogen complex, PGE spokesman Drew Hanson said via email.

The cancellation comes at a dicey time for the tri-state Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, the ringleader that is channeling federal money to projects in the region. The U.S. Energy Department is scrutinizing clean energy programs and initiatives launched under the Biden administration, including the Northwest hub. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he is ready to terminate funding for projects that he deems “a bridge to nowhere.”

Elected officials from across the political spectrum in the Northwest have defended low-emissions hydrogen as a promising means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power.

“We have several new projects in the pipeline that we’re excited to share more on soon,” spokesperson Kaitlin Sheppard said in an emailed statement on behalf of the Northwest hydrogen hub. “PNWH2 continues to evaluate additional project interest and remains focused on supporting a broad, resilient regional hydrogen ecosystem with the potential to deliver lasting economic value to Oregon and the greater Pacific Northwest.”

The PGE and Mitsubishi Power pullback follows in the wake of the scrapping of a different hydrogen factory in Centralia, Washington, proposed by Fortescue, which was to be one of the primary producers of the alternative fuel within the regional clean energy hub. Another founding partner in the PNWH2 Hub, Seattle-based developer of hydrogen-powered mining trucks First Mode, declared bankruptcy last December.

PGE’s pivot calls into question what will happen at the nearby Port of Morrow, where Air Liquide planned to build a hydrogen liquefaction plant to support distribution of clean hydrogen to urban fueling stations and the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. PGE and Mitsubishi were supposed to supply the gaseous hydrogen to Air Liquide via a short pipeline from the site of PGE’s demolished coal power plant outside Boardman.

Air Liquide acknowledged a request for comment, but a spokesperson declined to shed more light about where things are headed now.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub said in its emailed statement that “project adjustments were expected and planned for” in the early development phase of the nascent industry. The pullback in this region tracks with what is happening elsewhere.

Brand name corporations — such as Shell, BP and Airbus — and lesser-known startups around the world are scaling back their hydrogen ambitions. Commonly cited reasons include a slower-than-anticipated emergence of customer demand and stubbornly high costs to produce green hydrogen.

The developers behind the two remaining large-scale projects in the Northwest hydrogen hub are pressing ahead. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro plans to build a $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, for which hydrogen produced on site will be a key ingredient. Meanwhile, Calgary-based AltaGas has a costly plan to redevelop the closed Alcoa aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.

Crucially, Atlas Agro and AltaGas need to secure large volumes of affordable renewable electricity for the energy-intensive process of making hydrogen. The green fertilizer plant reportedly needs around 300 megawatts of power, which is a bigger load than all of the rest of Richland combined.

AltaGas estimated last year that it needs about 265 megawatts of electricity to achieve its maximum production target at Ferndale. Neither company has confirmed they have a power supply contract amid rising competition for sources of renewable electricity.

“The success of this project is contingent on regulatory and financial incentive certainty, timely approvals, and a clear and predictable path forward from government and commercial partners,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub game plan envisions that producers will make “green” hydrogen exclusively by splitting water molecules with an electric current. This process (known as electrolysis) must use renewable electricity for the resulting hydrogen to be considered green.

Uncertain Government Support

A year ago, the Pacific NW hub collected the first installment from its potentially $1 billion federal allocation. That $27.5 million in initial funding through the Energy Department partially passed through to participating companies and to Washington State University to begin site planning and community outreach.

Under the original program terms, another tranche of funding would come 12-18 months after the first to subsidize developer permitting and engineering. A third tranche could underwrite the construction phase for multiple years, before a possible final shot of money comes to subsidize production ramp up. In all, the hub could pass through federal subsidies to its participants for 8-12 years.

But this past May, Wright, President Donald Trump’s energy secretary, announced a department-wide review of grant programs to root out “wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars.” Wright expressed skepticism about government support to scale up clean hydrogen.

“Hydrogen, it’s tough with the math to see how in the long term it becomes a meaningful commercial energy source,” Wright told senators at a budget hearing in front of the Senate Energy Committee in June, during which Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, pressed him to state his position on the hydrogen hubs.

“It’s expensive to produce, but there are high value uses,” Wright went on to say about hydrogen. He predicted the agency will continue funding some projects under review, modify others and terminate the “low-value” ones.

Cantwell responded that the Northwest’s renewable hydropower made her region a good place to make hydrogen for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

A spokesperson at Energy Department headquarters confirmed this past week that the program vetting was ongoing, but declined to estimate when the results will become known.

Democrats in the U.S. Senate preemptively wrote a joint letter to Wright in April asserting it would be illegal for the Trump administration to unilaterally cancel Congressionally-approved spending on clean energy projects. Oregon’s Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Washington’s Patty Murray and Cantwell signed on.

“Our Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and exclusive power to appropriate funds,” the 27 senators wrote. “In this instance, where Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for programs that support clean energy projects, the Department must faithfully execute the law and expend the funds for the purposes provided.”

If the PNWH2 Hub survives the Energy Department vetting, the pressure will still be on. Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled Congress shortened the window for companies to get lucrative tax incentives that were created in the 2022 Biden climate and clean energy package.

Private developers now have until the end of 2027 to begin construction on a hydrogen plant in order to qualify for production tax credits. The deadline was previously 2033. Clean hydrogen producers strive to qualify for the tax credit in order to lower the otherwise high retail price of the fuel.

“Under current federal and state permitting regimes, this accelerated timeline may jeopardize our eligibility for the tax credit, which is essential for achieving positive project returns, and we are evaluating our ability to meet the new timelines,” said Doyle from AltaGas.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world’s first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.

Musk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world's most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company's compensation committee — not least because of Tesla’s main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk's foray into right-wing politics.

“It doesn’t matter how much money he gets. He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high. “And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.”

To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world’s first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world’s most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.

Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.

Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years. He is currently estimated to be worth more than $400 billion by Forbes magazine.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German. Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla’s 0.7%.

Without a reversal of those trends, meeting the financial goals could prove especially difficult. In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Even bulls on the stock are not convinced the new pay incentive will keep Musk, who frequently posts on his X social media platform, from saying things that alienate potential buyers.

Said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, “Fixing the Musk brand damage remains a work in progress."" Even so, Ives told clients, “We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk.”

In January 2024, a Delaware judge threw out Musk’s previous pay package, worth $44.9 billion at the time. Investors voted to restore that compensation package at Tesla’s last shareholders meeting on June 13 of last year. But late last year the package was revoked for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling. Last month, Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented” growth — despite the drop in sales and profits — and noting that the CEO hadn’t been paid in years.

The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package. Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. Musk has said that he needed more shares and control so he couldn’t be ousted by shareholder activists. If he does hit all the goals, Musk would own about quarter of the company’s shares, up from 13% today.

China’s solar industry has experienced an explosive rise. In early 2025, monthly solar generation surged past 125 terawatt-hours (TWh)—a more than fivefold increase since 2018. For perspective, this figure is now higher than the steady 65–75 TWh per month produced by the entire U.S. nuclear fleet.

This is a symbolic turning point. For decades, nuclear power was the gold standard for large-scale, carbon-free electricity. Today, China’s solar farms produce more clean power on a monthly basis than America’s entire nuclear sector. The gap is expected to widen, as China continues adding record-breaking solar capacity each year.

Solar growth has been so steep that it is no longer just about meeting household or industrial demand. China is producing extra electricity. This allows it to power energy-demanding technologies like AI, cloud services, and electric vehicles. This “overbuilding” strategy ensures that when demand spikes, the grid has capacity ready.

In the first half of 2025, China’s solar installations more than doubled from a year earlier. This surge meant China added over twice the solar capacity of all other countries combined. The country now accounts for 67% of global installations, up from 54% in the same period of 2024.

Two Strategies, Two Futures: Beijing vs. Washington

A side-by-side comparison of energy goals shows just how far apart the two countries are in their approaches.

Solar and Wind Capacity (2025): China is on track for 1,400 GW, while the U.S. will reach only about 350 GW.

New Additions in 2025: China plans to add 212 GW of solar and 51 GW of wind, compared to less than 100 GW combined in the U.S.

Mega Projects: China is developing multi-gigawatt solar bases in deserts and multiple 100+ GW wind farms. The U.S.’s largest solar project—Gemini in Nevada—is just 690 MW, or less than 0.7 GW.

Offshore Wind: China already has 42.7 GW installed, compared with the U.S.’s Empire Wind project (816 MW phase 1, with a potential expansion to 2.1 GW).

The comparison reveals a structural difference. China views clean energy as national infrastructure, central to its industrial policy. The U.S., meanwhile, relies more heavily on market incentives and tax credits, which can shift with each administration.

Nuclear Power: The Long Game

China’s clean energy dominance is not limited to solar and wind. Nuclear power is becoming a core pillar of its long-term strategy.

As of 2025, China operates about 58 GW of nuclear power capacity, compared to 94 GW in the United States. At first glance, this seems like a smaller footprint, but the forward-looking numbers tell a different story.

China has more than 30 GW of nuclear capacity under construction, representing over half of the world’s current nuclear buildout. By comparison, U.S. nuclear growth is limited to incremental projects, with little in the way of large-scale expansion.

Looking ahead:

2030 Goal: China is targeting 200 GW of nuclear, while U.S. projections range from 100–110 GW.

2050 Vision: China aims for 500 GW of nuclear capacity, compared to the U.S.’s ambitious but unfunded target of 400 GW.

Nuclear offers China two critical advantages. First, it provides reliable baseload electricity, balancing out the intermittency of solar and wind. It also provides a secure, carbon-free power supply. This is crucial for industries that need constant electricity, like AI supercomputing, semiconductor fabs, and robotics manufacturing.

Mega Projects That Redraw the Energy Map

China’s energy expansion is not just about adding capacity; it’s about reshaping the global map of mega energy projects. Some of the most ambitious include:

Xinjiang Desert Solar Farm: A 3.5 GW solar base, one of the largest in the world, leveraging the region’s vast open land and high sunlight exposure.

Hundred-Gigawatt Wind Clusters: Multiple projects, each scaling over 100 GW, dwarf anything currently planned in other countries.

Hydropower Expansion: With over $170 billion invested, China is pursuing new gigaprojects, unlike the U.S., which is focused only on modernizing existing dams.

These projects are not built in isolation. They connect to ultra-high-voltage transmission lines, ensuring that clean electricity from remote areas flows to coastal cities, industrial parks, and increasingly, to massive data centers.

Energy and AI: The Hidden Race Behind Algorithms

The global AI race is about algorithms and chips as well as energy. Training large-scale AI models requires massive amounts of electricity. Data centers using these systems now consume power like small countries. By the end of this decade, their demand is set to triple.

China’s decision to overbuild renewables and expand nuclear capacity is directly linked to this future. By ensuring a surplus of clean, low-cost energy, China is preparing to host the next generation of AI clusters, robotics hubs, and cloud infrastructure.

U.S. Policy Uncertainty: A Strategic Weakness

While China pushes ahead, U.S. clean energy growth faces obstacles. Policy shifts and partisan battles have slowed momentum. Proposals to roll back tax credits or defund renewable energy research could reduce investor confidence and stall growth.

As one observer, Laurie Garrett, noted:

“By blocking and de-funding alternative energy R&D and tax incentives for use of solar, wind, nuclear and other renewables, Trump is handing the future on a gold platter to China.”

This concern is not just about climate. It’s about competitiveness. If the U.S. can’t boost energy capacity to meet growing AI and industrial needs, it may lose its leadership in key sectors. These sectors will shape global influence in the coming decades.

Clean Energy as the New Industrial Edge

China’s renewable and nuclear surge is reshaping the balance of global power. With solar generation now surpassing U.S. nuclear, nuclear projects expanding faster than anywhere else, and gigaprojects rising across deserts, mountains, and coastlines, China is ensuring it has the energy backbone for the AI-driven future.

The U.S. still retains advantages in innovation, advanced nuclear designs, and private-sector dynamism. But without consistent policy support and accelerated project deployment, it risks falling behind.

With regulatory tailwinds, federal incentives, and a clear alignment with decarbonization trends, Georgia Power’s initiatives not only address rising energy demand but also position Southern Company as a leader in the clean energy transition.

Regulatory Tailwinds: Policy-Driven Momentum

Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC), underscores a $2.3 billion investment in renewable energy and grid modernization from 2023 to 2025 [1]. This includes procuring up to 4,000 MW of new solar and battery storage by 2035, with 1,100 MW of new resources targeted through competitive bidding [2]. Regulatory approvals for these projects are critical, as they ensure cost recovery and rate stability for customers while enabling Southern Company to capitalize on long-term cash flows.

Federal incentives further amplify this momentum. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides a 30% investment tax credit (ITC) for solar and energy storage systems through 2032, reducing upfront costs and enhancing project viability [3]. Georgia Power has also secured regulatory flexibility to opt out of certain IRS tax normalization requirements, allowing it to accelerate ITC recognition [1]. These policy-driven advantages create a predictable financial environment, mitigating risks for investors.

Financial Metrics: ROI and Cost Savings

The financial case for Georgia Power’s solar projects is bolstered by robust returns. A 2025 study of a 100 MW solar project in Pakistan—a comparable large-scale initiative—revealed a payback period of 5.6 years and a net present value (NPV) of $31.7 million over 25 years [4]. While regional differences exist, Georgia’s access to the 30% ITC and falling solar installation costs (now $3–$5 per watt pre-incentive [5]) suggest similarly attractive returns.

For commercial projects, the combination of the ITC and 100% bonus depreciation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act can yield payback periods as short as five years and internal rates of return (IRR) exceeding 10% [3]. Residential solar adoption in Georgia, though less capital-intensive, also benefits from these incentives, with households saving 20%–25% on electricity costs over a system’s lifetime [6]. These metrics highlight solar’s scalability and its potential to drive Southern Company’s profitability.

Decarbonization Alignment: A Strategic Imperative

Georgia Power’s renewable targets align with national decarbonization goals. The utility plans to add 11,000 MW of renewable capacity by 2035, including 1,500 MW of battery storage, while uprating carbon-free nuclear units at Plants Hatch and Vogtle [2]. This diversified approach—balancing solar, storage, and nuclear—ensures reliability amid the intermittency of renewables, addressing a key concern for regulators and investors.

The broader industry context reinforces this strategy. Solar has been the leading source of new U.S. electricity generation in recent years, driven by declining costs and federal policies [7]. Georgia Power’s 2025 IRP also anticipates 8,500 MW of load growth by 2030, driven by data centers and EV manufacturing, necessitating a resilient grid [2]. By integrating 1,000+ miles of new transmission lines and modernizing existing infrastructure, Georgia Power is future-proofing its operations against demand shocks.

Shareholder Value: Growth and Stability

For Southern Company shareholders, Georgia Power’s renewable expansion offers dual benefits: growth from new revenue streams and stability from regulated returns. The utility’s $2.3 billion capital investment program from 2023 to 2025 [1] signals confidence in long-term cash flow generation, while its focus on low-cost solar and storage reduces exposure to volatile fossil fuel markets.

Moreover, Southern Company’s nuclear investments—such as the recent commercial operation of Plant Vogtle Unit 4 [8]—provide a hedge against renewable intermittency and position the company to benefit from production tax credits (PTC) for zero-carbon energy [9]. This hybrid model of nuclear, solar, and storage aligns with investor preferences for diversified, low-risk portfolios.

Conclusion

Southern Company’s strategic renewable expansion, led by Georgia Power’s solar initiatives, is a masterclass in leveraging regulatory and financial tailwinds. With a clear roadmap for decarbonization, robust ROI metrics, and a diversified energy mix, the company is not only meeting the demands of a growing Georgia but also securing its position as a clean energy leader. For shareholders, this translates to a compelling combination of growth, stability, and alignment with global sustainability trends—a recipe for long-term value creation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 04:58:32.410855

The company is undertaking a reduction of approximately 1.5% of its workforce, impacting less than 15,000 employees globally—the total number reported at the close of the prior year.

These workforce changes are primarily targeted at enhancing the operational efficiency of Rivian's commercial team, which oversees sales and service operations. The company has extended support to affected employees, encouraging them to seek alternative roles within the organization's open positions.

Rivian is set to commence production of the R2 model at its manufacturing plant in Normal, Illinois. This new model represents a strategic pivot toward more affordable electric vehicles, aiming to widen its market reach and garner greater demand. The R2 SUV, priced competitively at approximately $45,000, positions itself as a more accessible option compared to Rivian's prior models, including the R1T pickup and the R1S SUV.

In the face of policy shifts impacting the electric vehicle sector, Rivian is navigating economic pressures that have necessitated workforce adjustments. The expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers and stringent fuel economy regulations are adding layers of complexity for Rivian and its peers. These recent developments are poised to affect revenue streams associated with credit sales to other automakers, potentially delaying up to $100 million in expected income.

Despite the economic challenges, Rivian maintains that it possesses adequate financial reserves to support the forthcoming launch of the R2 model, highlighting this new vehicle as a critical element in its strategy to achieve profitability. Analysts believe that the success of the R2 could herald a turning point, fostering increased adoption among mainstream consumers. Rivian's financial loss of $1.1 billion reported in the second quarter underscores the urgency of its transition towards a broader customer base.

The R2 SUV's launch is thus a pivotal moment for Rivian, with the company's future resting partly on the vehicle's reception in the marketplace.

An August 23 referendum on restarting Taiwan’s Third Nuclear Power Plant failed to pass, bringing the island’s energy security concerns back into focus. As Taiwan strives to be a global hub for tech manufacturing, reliable energy supplies are vital to maintaining its edge in chipmaking and artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, the more than four million votes cast in favour of restarting the plant highlight public anxiety over Taiwan’s energy vulnerability — anxiety that could push leaders to revisit the island’s nuclear-free policy or risk losing votes in the 2028 presidential election.

Canada, already a major player in Taiwan’s offshore wind sector, could bring its nuclear expertise to bear in strengthening the island’s energy security, if Taipei were to revive atomic power.

In Brief

In May, the opposition Kuomintang and Taiwan People’s Party, which together hold a legislative majority, backed a referendum to restart Taiwan’s third nuclear power plant, arguing that the island could reduce dependence on imported fuel and ensure its own energy supply.

The Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant, located on the island’s southern tip, was taken offlinethe same month as part of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) pledge to phase out all of Taiwan’s nuclear power programs, which once met more than half of the island’s energy needs. Taiwan originally had three nuclear plants, which were shut between 2014 and 2025. Maanshan was the final plant to close.

Roughly 4.3 millionTaiwanese voted in favour of reopening the plant, vastly outnumbering the 1.5 million who voted against it. However, under referendum rules, a motion must secure the support of at least one quarter of Taiwan’s 20 million registered voters — around five million — to pass. By law, the same issue cannot be brought to a referendum again for another two years.

In response to the plebiscite, President Lai Ching-te left the door open to Taiwan reconsidering nuclear technology in the future if safety conditions are met.

Implications

Taiwan’s energy depends on imports, while renewables lag. The island imports more than 95 per cent of its energy. In 2024, liquefied natural gas (LNG) was the leading source of power generation, at over 40 per cent, while renewables accounted for only 13 per cent — well short of the government’s 20 per cent target. Power outages have become increasingly frequent.

Taiwan’s energy crunch could undermine its advanced technology leadership. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which produces 90 per cent of the world’s most advanced chips for clients such as Apple and Nvidia, uses nine per cent of Taiwan’s total electricity output. That share is set to expand. In 2021, a seven-hour blackout at TSMC’s Tainan plant directly disrupted production of TSMC’s 40-nanometre chip production. With an AI boom estimated to drive a 12-13 per cent increase in power demand by 2030, such energy shortages will continue to be a serious risk not only to the viability of Taiwan’s long-term tech leadership, but also to the global supply of advanced chips amid surging AI demand.

For Taiwan, energy security is also a chokepoint security issue. If Beijing were to launch a blockade of Taiwan, the island's limited reserves of natural gas and its reliance on imported energy would be critical vulnerabilities. Chinese military drills have already simulated blockades of Taiwan’s LNG gateways, with estimates suggesting that the island’s LNG supplies could be depleted within 10 days. Analysts warn China could also target Taiwan’s power grid, mirroring tactics Russia has employed in Ukraine.

However, restarting the Maanshan Plant runsthe risk of a Fukushima-like leak. Such an incident would have severe environmental consequences for the earthquake-prone region where the Maanshan plant is located. However, the high number of the referendum’s voters who were in favour of the plant’s reopening seems to indicate a shift in public opinion: a similar referendum in 2021 to restart the construction of two mothballed reactors at Lungmen faced 51 per cent opposition versus 47 per cent support. While the same proposal will not return for at least another two years, public anxiety could mean that the debate about nuclear energy remains active.

What’s Next

1. Nuclear remains difficult question for DPP

This failed — yet majority-backed — referendum underscores pressure on the Lai government to revisit the DPP’s ideological commitment to a “nuclear-free homeland.” If the DPP does not address the island’s lagging renewable development — and the public’s mounting concerns over a stable energy supply — the party’s support could take a hit in the 2028 presidential election.

2. Deepening Canada–Taiwan energy partnerships

Canada has emerged as a promising partner in Taiwan’s energy diversification, with Canadian investment in the island’s offshore wind projects having the potential to power over one million households. As Canada exports its first shipment of LNG in July to Asian markets, Taiwan is eyeing opportunities for collaboration, both in terms of investment and imports. Meanwhile, should Taiwan revisit its stance on nuclear power, Canada could contribute its full spectrum of capabilities, from fuel production to advanced reactor technologies, including the G7’s first small modular reactor with enhanced safety features. The Canadian Trade Gateway for Nuclear Development, announced as part of Ottawa’s 2022 Indo-Pacific Strategy, signals Canada’s commitment to sharing expertise and best practices in nuclear technology to help partners meet their clean energy needs.

This initiative represents a unified national platform to accelerate the commercial and industrial (C&I) sector’s shift toward clean energy, aligning with India’s goal of achieving 50% installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2070.

BVR Subrahmanyam, CEO of NITI Aayog, emphasized that the C&I sector is central to India’s growth but also a major energy consumer. He noted that CI-NERGY will bring together government, businesses, innovators, financiers, and policymakers to drive industrial decarbonization and enhance India’s climate competitiveness.

As one of the largest consumers of electricity and contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, the C&I sector has the potential to lead decarbonization through renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency, electrification, and innovative procurement models. With advancements in grid modernization, storage, and new technologies, the sector can strengthen India’s low-carbon economy.

Sujoy Ghosh, Co-Chairman of the Renewable Energy Council at CII-Sohrabji Godrej Green Business Centre, highlighted the urgent need for clean electrification across industries, stressing that the Alliance provides a timely platform for collaboration and scalable procurement solutions.

The CI-NERGY Alliance is designed as a self-sustaining, industry-led initiative to create an enabling ecosystem for clean power adoption. It will promote demand aggregation, standardized power purchase agreements, and transparent markets through data tools for tracking energy use and emissions reduction. By partnering with financial institutions, particularly to support MSMEs, it aims to expand access to green finance while showcasing scalable business models.

Bharath Jairaj, Executive Director for Energy at WRI India, said that collaboration and innovation are essential to accelerate the clean energy transition. He explained that the Alliance will address barriers to clean power adoption while promoting transparency, financing solutions, and practical models to boost competitiveness and resilience in the C&I sector.

The platform will also focus on peer learning and capacity building through a shared knowledge hub on procurement, technologies, and best practices. While open to all industries, the initial focus will be on textiles, pharmaceuticals, and data centers, sectors where clean energy adoption can have a significant impact.

It views this development as an innovation addressing a pressing bottleneck in the battery industry: safe, efficient and automated disassembly.
Recirculate says the system is designed to dismantle batteries in two key phases—from battery pack to module, and from module to cell level.
“We’ve trained a machine learning model to locate and identify each screw, extract their exact coordinates and send this data to the robot.
“This is one of the first working, real-world examples of battery disassembly using machine learning and robotics,” Pitkäaho says.","Recirculate, a European Union-funded project based in Finland, says it is developing a “state-of-the-art” electric vehicle (EV) battery disassembly system using artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.

Project leadership says it has successfully completed its first phase: the creation of a set of tools and machine learning models for the robotic dismantling of an EV battery from pack to cell level. It views this development as an innovation addressing a pressing bottleneck in the battery industry: safe, efficient and automated disassembly.

Recirculate says the system is designed to dismantle batteries in two key phases—from battery pack to module, and from module to cell level. Centria University of Applied Science’s team is leading work on this development within Recirculate and created a purpose-built robotic cell using a KUKA KR10 industrial robot. Recirculate says the robot, equipped with specially designed tools and a mobile linear track, can autonomously detect, unscrew and remove components of high-voltage battery packs.

“There are approximately 50 screws on the lid alone,” says Tomi Pitkäaho, principal lecturer in research, Centria University of Applied Science. “We’ve trained a machine learning model to locate and identify each screw, extract their exact coordinates and send this data to the robot. With a depth camera installed directly on the tool, the robot can precisely determine not just the ‘x’ and ‘y’ position, but also the z-depth for each component.”

Recirculate says the system uses multiple machine learning models to identify and extract critical components including screws, connectors and wiring. Once the lid is removed using a vacuum gripper, specialized robotic tools are used to dismantle internal components. The models not only recognize the elements but also analyze wire orientations to determine optimal disassembly strategies.

“We’ve developed tools that can detect and manipulate parts with remarkable precision,” Pitkäaho says. “From training datasets to model architecture and deployment, it took 18 months of dedicated work by our team of robotics, AI and ML [machine learning] experts.”

Beyond disassembly, Recirculate says its team has created a battery identification model that can recognize batteries eve in the absence of QR codes or digital product passports. Currently, project participants claim the model can identify battery types from manufacturers such as Ford and Tesla with nearly 100 percent accuracy, enabling the system to automatically select the correct disassembly program.

“This is one of the first working, real-world examples of battery disassembly using machine learning and robotics,” Pitkäaho says. “Until now, most efforts have been purely academic. We’re proud to bring this into industrial application through Recirculate.”

The project team says it is focused on expanding its proprietary training dataset in order to scale the solution and extend its compatibility to other battery types.",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/09/05/recirculate_robot_disassembly-web.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 14:03:29.848586

Attorneys General William Tong of Connecticut and Peter Neronha of Rhode Island announced Thursday that they’ll file suit in Rhode Island federal court to overturn the August 22 stop-work order from the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management (BOEM). The order abruptly shut down construction without citing any violation of law or safety threats. Instead, BOEM vaguely referred to “concerns” under its Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act authority, offering no explanation.

Revolution Wind is 15 nautical miles off Rhode Island and expected to come online in 2026. Once complete, the $6 billion project would supply 350,000 homes with electricity and save ratepayers in Connecticut and Rhode Island hundreds of millions of dollars over 20 years. The project supports more than 2,500 jobs across the US, including over 1,000 union construction jobs, and has already cleared every required state and federal review. Construction is already 80% complete.

The lawsuit, to be filed against the Department of the Interior, BOEM, and their nominated leaders, argues that the stop-work order violates the Administrative Procedure Act and the agency’s authority under OCSLA. The complaint says the government’s action is arbitrary, capricious, and undermines both states’ legal and financial commitments.

“Revolution Wind is fully permitted, nearly complete, and months from providing enough American-made, clean, affordable energy to power 350,000 homes. Now, with zero justification, Trump wants to mothball the project, send workers home, and saddle Connecticut families with millions of dollars in higher energy costs,” Tong said. “This kind of erratic and reckless governing is blatantly illegal, and we’re suing to stop it.”

Neronha added, “With Revolution Wind, we have an opportunity to create good-paying jobs for Rhode Islanders, enhance energy reliability, and ensure energy cost savings while protecting our environment. And yet, this stop-work order is not even the latest development in this administration’s all-out assault on wind energy. Just yesterday, we learned of reports that the Administration is pulling in staff from several different unrelated federal agencies, including Health and Human Services, to do its bidding. This is bizarre, this is unlawful, this is potentially devastating, and we won’t stand by and watch it happen.”

Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said the administration has offered no explanation nearly two weeks after the order. “We hoped to work with the Administration to lower energy costs, strengthen grid reliability, create jobs, and drive economic growth, but only if they share those goals. But if they do not, we will act to preserve this vital project and protect the energy future of Connecticut and the entire New England region,” he said.

Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) called the shutdown “insane, illogical, and illegal,” while Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) said, “The Revolution Wind project has already made it through exhaustive reviews by multiple federal agencies, and I doubt Trump’s flimsy excuses for scuttling this project will stand up to legal scrutiny.”

Danish renewables developer Ørsted, which owns a 50% share in Revolution Wind, also announced Thursday that it’s suing the Trump administration in a bid to restart construction on the blocked wind farm.

Rhode Island and Connecticut have said that halting construction of Revolution Wind would harm the states, their residents, investments and the offshore wind industry.","PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Connecticut, Rhode Island and the developer of an offshore wind farm that would power 350,000 homes in the two states said Thursday that they’re suing the Trump administration for stopping the nearly completed project.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha accused President Donald Trump of waging an “all-out assault” on the wind energy industry. The states’ lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, describes the Revolution Wind project as a “cornerstone” of their clean energy future, abruptly halted by federal officials without “statutory authority, regulatory justification or factual basis.”

Danish energy company Orsted filed a separate suit in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., also arguing that the administration lacks the legal authority to block the Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it would seek a preliminary injunction that would allow it to move forward with the project, which is 80% complete, with all underwater foundations and 45 of 65 turbines installed.

Interior Department spokesperson Elizabeth Peace said Thursday that the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Work on the project was paused Aug. 22 when the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop work order for what it said were national security concerns. It did not specify those concerns.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels for electricity. Revolution Wind is the second major wind project that his administration ordered to stop work. The first, an offshore wind project for New York, was later allowed to resume construction.

In separate recent federal court filings, the administration said it was reconsidering approvals for three other wind farms: the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind. Combined, those projects could power nearly 2.5 million homes in Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island with clean electricity.

Democratic Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, said Trump and his Cabinet “need to end their war on American energy and jobs.”

‘Swarm drone attacks’ cited as a reason for stopping work

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told CNN that he’s concerned offshore wind turbines distort radar detection systems, which could give cover to a bad actor to “launch a swarm drone attack through a wind farm.”

Retired U.S. Navy Cmdr. Kirk Lippold called that a “specious and false narrative” pushed by someone with an “overactive imagination in search of a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.” Lippold was commanding the USS Cole when al-Qaida attacked it in a Yemeni port in 2000.

If drones get that close to U.S. shores to be near a wind farm without being detected by the military, he said, “we have had a massive intelligence — a national security — failure.”

U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and national security expert, has also disputed the administration’s rationale, pointing to the Defense Department’s involvement in reviewing the project.

When it approved Revolution Wind in 2023, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said it consulted with the Defense Department at each stage of the regulatory process for the lease area assigned to the wind farm. The DOD concluded that with some site-specific stipulations, any impacts to its training and activities in the wind energy area would be “negligible and avoidable,” according to the record of decision.

The state and federal reviews took about nine years.

Trump and several Cabinet members repeatedly slammed wind power as ugly and expensive during last week’s Cabinet meeting. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. talked about the failure of a massive wind turbine blade at a different offshore wind farm under construction off Nantucket, Massachusetts.

Fiberglass fragments of a blade from the Vineyard Wind project broke apart and began washing ashore last summer during the peak of tourist season. Manufacturer GE Vernova agreed to pay $10.5 million in a settlement to compensate island businesses that suffered losses due to the blade failure.

Kennedy’s family famously opposed an earlier failed wind project not far from the family’s Cape Cod estate.

Trump said, “We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago.”

Wind farm was on track to deliver power in 2026

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island’s and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of providing about 2.5% of the region’s electricity needs.

Orsted began construction in 2024 about 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast. It says in its complaint that about $5 billion has been spent or committed, and it expects more than $1 billion in costs if the project is canceled. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Rhode Island and Connecticut have said that halting construction of Revolution Wind would harm the states, their residents, investments and the offshore wind industry. More than 1,000 people have been working on the wind farm, and Connecticut committed over $200 million to redevelop State Pier in New London to support the industry.

The states said they’re counting on the electricity from Revolution Wind, particularly in the winter, when demand in New England spikes and natural gas is prioritized for heating. The power would cost 9.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, locked in for 20 years. That’s cheaper than the average projected cost of energy in New England.

The head of Connecticut’s top environmental and energy agency, Katie Dykes, predicts it will cost the state’s electricity ratepayers tens of millions of dollars if the wind project doesn’t come online. She also noted the risk to electricity reliability in New England cited by the region’s independent system operator.

From St. James to Cameron Parish, environmental justice organizations have dragged parish commissions, global corporations and state agencies into court.

One group, The Descendants Project, a nonprofit based in St. John the Baptist Parish, has filed at least three lawsuits in recent years over a Formosa Plastics zoning dispute. One targeted the parish government itself, while the other targeted Formosa. A third lawsuit related to the same dispute was filed against the Port of South Louisiana.

The disputed zoning change, passed unanimously in 1990, reclassified land in Wallace from residential to heavy industrial. The Descendants Project says the move was tainted by corruption tied to then-Parish President Lester Millet and aimed at benefiting Formosa Plastics.

The land is home to the graves of former enslaved Blacks. Their names were Simon, Betsy, Rachel, Stanley and Harry.

In July, The Descendants Project and Inclusive Louisiana filed suit against Formosa, saying that Formosa is violating the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by owning and controlling the bodies.

While such lawsuits are sometimes well intentioned, they are “at least in part by a desire simply to burden the defendant or the defendant’s industry in some way,” said Robert Stilson of the Capital Research Center. “This might be through causing delays or increased costs, scoring public relations points, or attempting to achieve through litigation what those activists have been unable to achieve through legislation”

The Descendants Project also sued the Port of South Louisiana, accusing its board of secretly predetermining a vote on Greenfield’s grain elevator deal through email – a violation, they allege, of the state’s open meetings law.

Many of the lawsuits across the state include the same groups.

RISE St. James, Inclusive Louisiana, and the Mount Triumph Baptist Church, represented by the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, are pressing their case against St. James Parish and Koch. Koch and parish officials have asked the Louisiana Supreme Court to shut the case down and revive approvals for an expansion at Koch’s methanol plant.

The same three groups, also represented by Tulane, have a separate lawsuit against the parish saying it “discriminates against them by directing hazardous industrial facility development towards majority-Black districts and Black churches, where their members and congregants live.”

And just last week, another front opened in Cameron Parish, as reported by The Advocate. The Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club, and Environmental Integrity Project filed suit against the state Department of Environmental Quality for granting Venture Global a permit to build its Calcasieu Pass 2 liquefied natural gas facility.

“This company has been a bad neighbor and continually pollutes the air we breathe, while generating billions of dollars in profits,” resident and Sierra Club member John Allaire said in announcing the lawsuit.

The Sierra Club chapter of Louisiana, an environmental lobbying and legal group, has a long list of ongoing litigation against various big businesses.

“It’s disappointing to see nationally-backed activists try to litigate their agenda instead of working with local communities to understand the positive impact U.S. LNG brings to Louisiana and the world,” Venture Global wrote The Center Square in a statement.

The Bucket Brigade has also turned its firepower on New Orleans, suing the city and a development district in 2024 over a tax break deal for Shell Oil. The group says it was rushed through illegally and unfairly shifted tax burdens onto residents.

Taken together, the lawsuits reflect the strategy of a small but interconnected network of nonprofit groups that have reshaped environmental battles in south Louisiana.

The Descendants Project and Inclusive Louisiana have focused on challenging heavy industry expansion in St. John and St. James parishes, where descendants of enslaved people live in neighborhoods overshadowed by industrial development.

The Bucket Brigade has become one of the most visible opponents of industry in “Cancer Alley,” winning national recognition for forcing the cancellation of projects like the billion-dollar Wanhua chemical plant.

The Bucket Brigade, founded more than 20 years ago, has broadened its reach from oil refineries to liquefied natural gas export terminals, running campaigns that identify and train local residents to speak before federal regulators, track accidents, and rally community resistance.

In its filings, the group says it is building an “early warning network” across parishes most targeted for industrial growth, particularly majority-Black communities in St. James and St. John.

Some of these nonprofits are being bankrolled by an out-of-state foundation with an ironic stake in Big Oil. The Elizabeth B. and Arthur E. Roswell Foundation Inc., which as of 2023 held more than 6,800 shares of BP stock, has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into Louisiana’s grassroots groups.

Tax records show the Roswell Foundation gave $33,000 to the Descendants Project, $76,000 to the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and tens of thousands more to groups like Jubilee Justice in Alexandria, Rural Roots Louisiana, and Voice of the Experienced.

The foundation committed even larger future payments, including $90,000 to the Descendants Project, $120,000 to the Bucket Brigade, and $120,000 to Rural Roots Louisiana.

Cancer rates in Louisiana are among the highest in the nation and are often attributed to irresponsible business practices in the petrochemical industry, which has a massive presence in Louisiana.

Federal agents walked into a massive Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions construction site yesterday and detained nearly 500 people on suspected immigration offenses. The site, near Savannah, Georgia, is the home of a future electric vehicle battery plant. On Instagram, video posted by an account with the name Alex Morales showed a group of people listening to a masked man who identifies himself as part of Homeland Security.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED DHS OFFICER: We need construction to cease immediately. We need all work to end on the site right now.

DETROW: Homeland Security Investigations says this was the largest single-site operation they have ever carried out. NPR's Camila Domonoske covers cars for NPR and joins us now. Hey there.

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi.

DETROW: What do we know about this workplace raid so far?

DOMONOSKE: Yeah. So Homeland Security Investigations, which is the branch of ICE that carries out this kind of workplace raid, they say that they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean. Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions - both of those companies are headquartered in South Korea. Here's Special Agent Steven Schrank speaking at a press conference.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVEN SCHRANK: Some that illegally crossed the border into the United States, some that came in through visa waiver and were prohibited from working, some that had visas and overstayed their visas.

DETROW: So who was employing the people who were detained?

DOMONOSKE: It's a good question. You know, in a project like this, there are really complicated webs of subcontractors and subcontractors to subcontractors. Hyundai says that it believes that nobody detained was directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. LG Energy Solutions hasn't responded to NPR's requests for comment.

That Homeland Security official said that this raid was tied to, quote, ""allegations of unlawful employment practices and serious federal crimes,"" end quote. He did not provide more details on that, and there are no charges filed in this case right now. Officials say this is an ongoing investigation. It would be unusual if charges are eventually filed because immigration raids like this, where workers are detained - they don't often end with criminal charges for employers.

DETROW: Tell us more about where this raid happened.

DOMONOSKE: It's on this huge campus of buildings near Savannah, Georgia, that also includes a large factory where Hyundai is right now building electric vehicles. That factory was not directly affected by the raid. Production of vehicles didn't actually stop. But the battery plant that's under construction nearby, which is where the raid actually happened - it's an important part of the long-term plans for this facility 'cause the goal is to build not just electric vehicles, but the whole supply chain for these vehicles here in the U.S.

And that's important not just to Hyundai, but actually to the United States more broadly in this effort to try to compete with China over the future of electric vehicles. So Hyundai is investing some $26 billion in moving manufacturing to the U.S., including this project. It's a big deal for the company and for Georgia. The state's called it the largest economic development project in state history.

DETROW: And I understand you just heard back from Hyundai. What did they say?

DOMONOSKE: They said they're going to conduct an investigation into suppliers and their subcontractors to make sure they are all following employment law and other laws and regulations. Meanwhile, Congressman Buddy Carter, who represents the area surrounding the plant, posted on X that he applauded the Trump administration for taking bold action. And the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it voiced concerns to the United States about respecting South Korean economic activity and citizens.

DETROW: That is NPR's Camila Domonoske. Thank you so much.

DOMONOSKE: Thank you.

In the two decades since Hurricane Katrina, Entergy has worked alongside local partners to invest in clean energy, financial empowerment, and economic development, creating pathways to prosperity for Gulf South communities while preparing them for a stronger, more sustainable future.

When Entergy rebuilds, it extends beyond poles and wires; it’s about building the community back stronger – whether equipping schools with solar panels, creating 130 miles of bike lanes or replanting almost 100,000 trees wiped out by the storm.

The company has also made significant investments in solar energy, energy efficiency, and grid resilience, ensuring that families, schools, and businesses have access to power that is affordable, reliable, and clean.

John Weiss, Entergy’s Vice President of Sustainability and Environmental Policy.

For more than twenty years, Entergy shareholders have invested nearly $44 million in environmentally beneficial projects and programs through the Environmental Initiatives Fund. The fund identifies projects or programs throughout Entergy’s service area that improve the environment by reducing emissions, protecting natural resources and restoring wetlands and forests. In the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the fund supported local organizations that made a big impact on the communities Entergy calls home. From coastal restoration to sustainable parade throws, Entergy’s support helped deliver real results.

Grounds Krewe, a nonprofit organization focused on waste prevention, is working to increase recycling efforts and expand the use of eco-friendly parade throws and consumable goods. “With continued support from Entergy’s Environmental Initiative Fund, the Entergy Charitable Foundation, and hundreds of volunteer hours from their staff, our non-profit has been able to provide over 760,000 eco-friendly, functional throw alternatives to Mardi Gras Krewes and divert 112,000 pounds of material from the landfill through parade recycling initiatives,” says Brett Davis, director of Grounds Krewe. “Entergy’s help was fundamental in getting us off the ground and has kept our programs thriving.”

These efforts are grounded in Entergy’s climate action plan, which includes a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Through renewable energy, advanced battery storage, and smarter grid technology, Entergy is shaping a future where sustainability benefits everyone. Importantly, these innovations also create economic opportunities. By training local workers to install, maintain, and manage renewable energy infrastructure, Entergy connects environmental progress directly to jobs and workforce development, ensuring that economic growth and sustainability move forward together.

Just as Entergy invests in cleaner energy, it also empowers families to build financial stability and create generational wealth. Through partnerships with United Way of Southeast Louisiana, Entergy supports Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) centers, helping families claim the refunds and tax credits they deserve. From 2011 through 2024, Entergy volunteers have helped refund more than $354 million in earned income tax credits to customers across its system, with nearly half of those refunds going to Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans customers. Entergy’s pro bono

legal program also assists residents in securing critical documents related to housing, helping them retain home ownership and access rebuilding funds – work that has had a transformative and generational impact on families across the region. Over the past decade, Entergy’s dedicated legal team has contributed more than 22,000 hours of pro bono work, resulting in a $6.1 million in-kind donation to the communities Entergy serves.

“Entergy’s dedicated pro bono volunteers have played a pivotal role in helping families retain their homes, guiding them through the process of securing essential paperwork to access rebuilding funds and foster family wealth,” said Christy Kane, Entergy Pro Bono Counsel. “This initiative not only bolsters economic stability within our region but, more importantly, provides immense relief to community members who can finally claim legal ownership of family homes.

Christy shared one particularly moving story: “One woman told me that locking the door at night now brings her peace, knowing her grandmother’s home is finally in her name. That sense of security ensures her family’s legacy will live on.”

Kane was recently selected as a Daily Point of Light Award honoree for her pro bono work with Entergy by the Points of Light organization, an organization that honors U.S. companies that prioritize giving back, empowering volunteer work and creating sustainable community programs. Working on issues like these reinforces how personal this work can be for Kane, and everyone at Entergy.

Beyond helping families secure their homes, Entergy also extends its commitment to strengthening the Gulf South by supporting local businesses and fostering economic opportunities. Through mentorship programs, contracting partnerships, and financial tools, Entergy helps entrepreneurs grow their businesses and contribute to a thriving Gulf South economy.

From reducing energy costs and strengthening infrastructure to supporting families and small businesses, Entergy’s work reflects a vision where environmental progress, economic empowerment, and community resilience are all connected.

Twenty years after Katrina, the company continues to partner with communities to create pathways from recovery to renewal, ensuring that the Gulf South’s future is one of strength, opportunity, and shared prosperity.

Those restrictions could effectively prevent the expansion of National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Scenic and Historic Trails administered by the BLM.
The order would also allow states to use the conservation fund to buy federal property, including protected federal conservation land.
The Land and Water Conservation Fund has pumped more than $175 million into acquiring and improving public land at Red Rock Canyon and Lake Tahoe, according to the Nevada Conservation League.
Local conservation groups warned the restrictions could prevent new investments in the outdoor recreation economy and halt pending land deals and projects.","The Department of the Interior announced plans Thursday to reshape a popular conservation program that uses offshore oil royalties to support conservation projects, including narrowing the ways those funds can be spent.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order guiding the allocation of more than $430 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to projects that would “benefit wildlife habitat, improve water quality and provide flood protection while creating new recreational opportunities.”

“The Land and Water Conservation Fund continues to deliver on its promise to connect Americans to the outdoors while protecting the landscapes that make our nation special,” said Burgum in a statement.

But local conservation groups say the changes threaten to undermine the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2020, which contributes hundreds of millions of dollars to the development and rehabilitation of parks, conservation areas and outdoor recreation facilities across the nation.

Conservation groups said language in the order restricts the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from using the fund to acquire additional land that could be used to expand recreation and conservation.

Those restrictions could effectively prevent the expansion of National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Scenic and Historic Trails administered by the BLM.

“Nevada is approximately 86% public land, of which 67% is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. If you have enjoyed some form of outdoor recreation in Nevada, there is a good chance it was on BLM managed land. If you have camped, hiked, OHV’ed or hunted in Nevada, it was likely in or near a National Conservation Area or National Monument,” said Russell Kuhlman, executive director of the Nevada Wildlife Federation.

The order would also allow states to use the conservation fund to buy federal property, including protected federal conservation land. Those changes could open the door to land transfers that shift public land to private ownership, said the Nevada Conservation League.

“Nevadans overwhelmingly support protecting these places, and we cannot afford to roll back decades of progress in opening and protecting access to the great outdoors,” said Kristee Watson, Executive Director of the Nevada Conservation League.

The Land and Water Conservation Fund has pumped more than $175 million into acquiring and improving public land at Red Rock Canyon and Lake Tahoe, according to the Nevada Conservation League.

The order also “increased bureaucratic red tape” by requiring both state governors and local county officials to approve land acquisitions purchased using the fund, said the Nevada Wildlife Federation.

Local conservation groups warned the restrictions could prevent new investments in the outdoor recreation economy and halt pending land deals and projects.

In 2023, Nevada’s outdoor recreation industry accounted for $8.1 billion in value-added (GDP) annually, ranking the state 10th in the nation, according to the Nevada Division of Outdoor Recreation.

The Department of the Interior did, however, back away from earlier plans to include language that would siphon money away from conservation land purchases to pay for maintenance projects on federal property.

“Fortunately,” the order does not include one of the administration’s worst ideas, leaving out its prior proposal to divert LWCF funding for unauthorized purposes,” said Amy Lindholm, a spokesperson for the Land and Water Conservation Fund Coalition.

Lindholm continued, “Unfortunately, Secretarial Order 3442 still does real damage. It hinders critical conservation and public access by reviving previously rejected ideas.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/avi-kwa-ame-national-monument-1024x6581757114975.jpeg?h=e69e7156&itok=IwnxmtEi,N,,2025-09-06 15:04:06.577579

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED DHS OFFICER: We need construction to cease immediately. We need all work to end on the site right now.

DETROW: Homeland Security Investigations says this was the largest single-site operation they have ever carried out. NPR's Camila Domonoske covers cars for NPR and joins us now. Hey there.

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi.

DETROW: What do we know about this workplace raid so far?

DOMONOSKE: Yeah. So Homeland Security Investigations, which is the branch of ICE that carries out this kind of workplace raid, they say that they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean. Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions - both of those companies are headquartered in South Korea. Here's Special Agent Steven Schrank speaking at a press conference.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVEN SCHRANK: Some that illegally crossed the border into the United States, some that came in through visa waiver and were prohibited from working, some that had visas and overstayed their visas.

DETROW: So who was employing the people who were detained?

DOMONOSKE: It's a good question. You know, in a project like this, there are really complicated webs of subcontractors and subcontractors to subcontractors. Hyundai says that it believes that nobody detained was directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. LG Energy Solutions hasn't responded to NPR's requests for comment.

That Homeland Security official said that this raid was tied to, quote, ""allegations of unlawful employment practices and serious federal crimes,"" end quote. He did not provide more details on that, and there are no charges filed in this case right now. Officials say this is an ongoing investigation. It would be unusual if charges are eventually filed because immigration raids like this, where workers are detained - they don't often end with criminal charges for employers.

DETROW: Tell us more about where this raid happened.

DOMONOSKE: It's on this huge campus of buildings near Savannah, Georgia, that also includes a large factory where Hyundai is right now building electric vehicles. That factory was not directly affected by the raid. Production of vehicles didn't actually stop. But the battery plant that's under construction nearby, which is where the raid actually happened - it's an important part of the long-term plans for this facility 'cause the goal is to build not just electric vehicles, but the whole supply chain for these vehicles here in the U.S.

And that's important not just to Hyundai, but actually to the United States more broadly in this effort to try to compete with China over the future of electric vehicles. So Hyundai is investing some $26 billion in moving manufacturing to the U.S., including this project. It's a big deal for the company and for Georgia. The state's called it the largest economic development project in state history.

DETROW: And I understand you just heard back from Hyundai. What did they say?

DOMONOSKE: They said they're going to conduct an investigation into suppliers and their subcontractors to make sure they are all following employment law and other laws and regulations. Meanwhile, Congressman Buddy Carter, who represents the area surrounding the plant, posted on X that he applauded the Trump administration for taking bold action. And the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it voiced concerns to the United States about respecting South Korean economic activity and citizens.

DETROW: That is NPR's Camila Domonoske. Thank you so much.

DOMONOSKE: Thank you.

Alabama The Birmingham-based Techstars Alabama Power EnergyTech Accelerator is part of the Techstars network, launched with support from the utility Alabama Power in 2020.","Interest in clean technologies is rising across the nation, according to S&P Global. In a special report released at the beginning of the year, “Top Cleantech Trends for 2025,” the financial information and analytics company found that for the first time, this year’s global investments in clean technology supply – spanning across clean energy generation, green hydrogen production, and carbon capture and storage – will be larger than the year’s investments in upstream oil and gas.

Numerous accelerators, educational institutions, and other organizations are helping the sector to advance and prosper. Across the Southeast, in particular, organizations are working to advance cleantech.

North Carolina

The Research Triangle Cleantech Cluster traces its origins to the Research Triangle Regional Partnership, an economic development organization. Located close to Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in one of the world’s biggest research parks, more than 350 cleantech companies can be found. The cluster, therefore, has cultivated a network of members and partners that it regularly convenes to offer opportunities to build relationships, exchange ideas, and foster innovation. Some of the most notable members include ABB, Duke Energy, and Hitachi, all of which have seats on the Research Triangle Cleantech Cluster Board of Directors. The cleantech cluster also deploys programs and taps partnerships to help develop the next generation of cleantech leaders, such as the Cleantech Connect Career Fair, which it claims is the biggest cleantech career fair in the Southeast.

Across the state in Charlotte, the Joules Accelerator launched in 2013 to advise and advance early-stage climate startups, which it connects with industry advisors and provides access to events where they can pitch potential customers. After graduation, the startups can apply for a Joules Camp pilot grant to deploy their technologies in local communities. With two 90-day cohorts per year, the accelerator has seen more than 90 graduates join its portfolio, which have raised more than $1.7 billion in early-stage venture funding and created more than 3,300 new jobs to date. Some of their most notable graduates include Huntersville, North Carolina-based EV charging solution provider Atom Power and San Francisco, California-based EV charging optimization company WeaveGrid. The nonprofit also received support from companies including GE Vernova, Honeywell, and both the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Economic Development Association.

Georgia

In 2023, the Greenhouse Accelerator launched the Georgia Cleantech Innovation Hub in Atlanta. The state is located in the battery belt, with universities that spend more than $3 billion on research and development per year. Furthermore, there are more than 800 cleantech companies in Atlanta alone, particularly in the e-mobility and solar industries. The public-private-academic partnership seeks to contribute to this momentum by providing local education to build cleantech expertise, building a connected community of cleantech leaders, creating places for them to meet, and ultimately, “fostering the innovation and sustainability culture in a way that is uniquely Georgia.”

The Georgia Cleantech Innovation Hub last year teamed up with gener8tor and the Cox Enterprises empire to launch the Cox Cleantech Accelerator in Atlanta. The twice-yearly, twelve-week program, with five companies per cohort, has supplied Southeastern early-stage operations with industry connections, mentorship, and $100,000 in capital investment each. Some of the success stories from the first program include Accelerate Wind, whose small wind turbines are meant to be paired with solar panels for commercial rooftop installation to boost energy generation by an additional 25%, and Flux Hybrids, whose plug-in hybrid powertrain technology can be installed on new vehicles to increase their fuel efficiency. The second cohort launched at the end of last month. Moreover, Cox Enterprises and Cox Cleantech have collectively invested more than $2 billion in cleantech businesses spanning a variety of stages, from early startups to more commercially successful companies, since 2007.

Tennessee

In 2020, the Spark Innovation Center at the University of Tennessee Research Park teamed up with Evergreen Climate Innovations – previously Clean Energy Trust – to launch the Spark Cleantech Accelerator. In the five years following, the twelve-week accelerator program has assisted 29 early-stage cleantech companies that have together raised more than $77 million in funding and created 108 jobs. Last year, the Spark Innovation Center announced that the country’s biggest utility, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), would sponsor the Spark Cleantech Accelerator, offering its technical expertise, as well as funding to the startups. The companies selected for the 2025 Spark Cleantech Accelerator, which will launch at the end of this month, can expect to benefit from training workshops, prototyping services through the University of Tennessee’s Center for Materials Processing, and practice with pitching. Other sources of funding and support for the program include the City of Knoxville and the Tennessee Advanced Energy Business Council.

Alabama

The Birmingham-based Techstars Alabama Power EnergyTech Accelerator is part of the Techstars network, launched with support from the utility Alabama Power in 2020. The accelerator invests across the entire energy vertical, ranging from clean energy, to clean vehicles, to the grid. By the end of 2023, the participating companies in the program had collectively raised $150 million. Graduates have included Boise, Idaho-based Pitch Aeronautics, which deploys power line components via droids, and Los Angeles, California-based EV Safe Charge, whose EV charging robot, named ZiGGY, comes to you. Other support for this accelerator came from the University of Alabama, the Economic Development Partnership of Alabama, and the Alabama Department of Commerce, again indicating the importance of community involvement in these types of initiatives.

Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty in Oak Ridge on Thursday to celebrate what is becoming a pattern in the Atomic City of major nuclear companies announcing giant investments.

Oklo, a California-based developer of advanced nuclear reactors and fuel recycling, unveiled plans to build a nuclear fuel recycling plant in the first stage of an advanced fuel center that could total $1.68 billion invested and 800 jobs created.

The fuel recycling center would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and would turn used nuclear fuel into fuel for so-called fast reactors like Oklo's Aurora powerhouse, which is cooled by liquid metal rather than water.

(READ MORE: Tennessee, local governments will forgo sales taxes on $4.5B nuclear facility)

The company said it was working with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the largest public utility in the U.S., to explore recycling used fuel from its nuclear plants at the Oak Ridge facility. It could also one day sell electricity from its reactors to TVA, which is based in Knoxville and has its largest presence in Chattanooga.

""Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,"" Jacob DeWitte, Oklo co-founder and CEO, said in a press release. ""By recycling used fuel at scale, we are turning waste into gigawatts, reducing costs and establishing a secure U.S. supply chain that will support the deployment of clean, reliable and affordable power. Tennessee is showing the nation that recycling can be done to support new nuclear development and growth.""

Oklo has completed a licensing plan for the facility with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. More than 94,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel is stored at nuclear power plant sites, much of which is recyclable, the company said.

The Oak Ridge facility is expected to begin producing fuel for Oklo reactors by the early 2030s.

The U.S. Department of Energy gave Oklo a site use permit in 2019, and the company was awarded fuel for its first reactor from Idaho National Laboratory. The company says it's on track to bring its first reactor online by the end of the decade.

Oklo cited executive orders from President Donald Trump aimed at streamlining nuclear licensing and speeding up new nuclear deployments, partly in a race to compete with China on artificial intelligence development.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stepped down as chair of the Oklo board earlier this year to avoid conflicts of interest as the two companies deepen their partnerships.

TVA is a critical piece of the AI puzzle as the power provider to Oak Ridge since the town was created by the U.S. government in 1943 to enrich uranium for the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945.

""The next generation of nuclear technologies are being built and developed right here in our own backyard,"" TVA President and CEO Don Moul said in the release. ""Our partnership with Oklo represents yet another step forward in shaping the future of nuclear energy and ensuring a secure energy future for the Valley and beyond.""

The Oklo announcement came one year to the day after Orano USA, the U.S. subsidiary of French nuclear fuels company Orano, announced it would build in Oak Ridge what state officials called the largest private investment in Tennessee history.

Orano plans to construct a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment plant on land formerly owned by the U.S. Department of Energy to sell domestically produced nuclear fuel to commercial power plants.

The nuclear fuel supply chain was upended in 2022 when Russia, the world's dominant supplier of enriched uranium, launched a full-scale war against Ukraine.

Gov. Bill Lee has worked to position Tennessee as the U.S. leader in attracting nuclear investment and supporting nuclear companies, creating a special fund and an advisory council in 2023. Orano received $6 million from the state fund.

More than 150 nuclear companies have a presence in Oak Ridge, according to the East Tennessee Economic Council.

""Tennessee is well positioned to lead America's energy independence, which is why we created the Nuclear Energy Fund to support and expand our state's nuclear ecosystem,"" Lee said in the release. ""We're proud to partner with Oklo to innovate for the future, while bringing continued opportunity and prosperity to Tennessee families.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/09/06/103773279_fuel_recycling_render_pr_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-09-06 03:58:09.560374

He noted that two million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.
But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.
All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates.
“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said.","The “one big beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law in July is set to upend many aspects of American life, including climate policy. The law, which Republicans backed en masse, not only derails the nation’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could also strike a blow to consumers’ pocketbooks.

From a climate perspective, the legislation’s most significant rollbacks are aimed at industries such as renewable energy, not individuals. But there will be very real impacts for taxpayers hoping to decarbonize their homes.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, provided tax credits for climate-friendly purchases ranging from heat pumps to solar arrays through 2032. That time frame has been cut to as little as a few months.

“This bill is going to take away a lot of assistance from consumers,” said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He noted that two million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.

The good news is that the law does not affect the billions of dollars that the IRA already sent to state efficiency and electrification rebate programs, and that much of that money will remain available beyond the federal sunsets. But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.

“If consumers are able to make the investment now,” he said, “it will help them out.”

For those looking to act, Grist shares a roundup of when credits will go away.

Buy an EV before October

New electric vehicles that meet federal domestic manufacturing requirements qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. While credits on foreign-made EVs aren’t offered directly to consumers, automakers do get them and often pass the savings along through leases. Used EVs under $25,000 that are purchased at a dealer are also eligible for up to a $4,000 credit.

All of this goes away on September 30. There will be no credits after that. Ultimately, this will make new electric vehicles more expensive and put the technology further out of reach for low- to moderate-income Americans.

The income caps on the EV credits still apply, limiting the benefit on new EVs to those households earning less than $300,000 and on used vehicles to those earning less than $150,000. There is an MSRP limit of $80,000 for new cars, too.

Strangely, the tax credit for installing an EV charger (up to $1,000) runs through June of next year.

Make home improvements by the end of the year

The remarkably vast Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides up to $2,000 toward qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers. It offers another $1,200 toward efficiency upgrades such as insulation, doors, windows, and even home energy audits.

These are going away on December 31. All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates. You must have a tax bill to benefit, which may not be the case for certain low-income households.

Pay for solar this year

The most valuable IRA incentive being axed is the Residential Clean Energy Credit. It covers 30 percent of clean energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps, and there is no cap. With the average cost of a solar system in the U.S. just north of $28,000, that means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500. That credit vanishes at the end of this year, though the law refers to the “expenditures” being made by then, so that could mean paying for — but not necessarily installing — a system by then.

Like with other credits, Ungar suggests confirming any changes with a tax professional. He also said that the potential for higher tariffs is another reason to move quickly. But, he said, even after the credits go away, many of these improvements could still make financial sense over the long term.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said. “In some cases, improvements are going to be a no-brainer regardless.”",https://keyt.b-cdn.net/2025/09/grist-environmental-tax-credits_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:08:00.281778

DTE Energy (DTE), a major player in the U.S. energy market, now faces a high-stakes legal battle involving its subsidiary, EES Coke Battery, LLC, which could redefine how investors assess regulatory exposure in utility valuations.

Legal Developments and Escalating Risks

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has filed a motion for partial summary judgment against EES Coke, alleging Clean Air Act violations at the Zug Island facility. A federal court denied DTE’s motion to dismiss the case, ruling that DTE is an operator of the facility and thus legally liable under the Act [1]. On August 25, 2025, the court granted the EPA’s motion for partial summary judgment on liability, effectively confirming the company’s responsibility for sulfur dioxide emissions and reporting failures [2]. EES Coke has since sought an interlocutory appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, but a bench trial to determine remedies—including a potential $140 million fine—remains scheduled for September 15, 2025 [3].

This case underscores the growing scrutiny of legacy industrial operations within utility portfolios. According to a report by USA Herald, the EPA’s demand for penalties reflects a broader regulatory shift toward stricter enforcement of air quality standards, particularly for facilities emitting sulfur dioxide, a pollutant linked to respiratory illnesses and environmental degradation [3].

Financial Exposure and Valuation Implications

DTE Energy has acknowledged the case as a “material event” in its SEC filings, though it cannot predict the financial impact [2]. The potential $140 million fine alone could strain the non-utility segment of DTE’s business, which includes EES Coke. For context, DTE’s non-utility segment reported operating income of $250 million in Q2 2025 [1]. If the court imposes additional remediation costs or operational restrictions, the financial burden could escalate further.

Regulatory risks like these are not merely one-time charges; they can erode investor confidence and inflate capital costs. Utilities are typically valued using metrics like earnings yield and dividend stability, but regulatory penalties introduce volatility. As stated by Planet Detroit, the case adds to DTE’s existing challenges in its clean energy transition, where compliance costs and capital expenditures for decarbonization are already rising [1].

Investor Considerations: Balancing Risk and Resilience

For investors, the EES Coke case highlights the importance of evaluating regulatory risk as a core component of utility valuation. While DTE’s utility operations remain stable—benefiting from regulated rate structures and long-term infrastructure projects—the non-utility segment’s exposure to litigation could create asymmetrical risks.

Data from Panabee indicates that DTE’s stock has historically traded at a premium to peers due to its diversified energy portfolio and transition plans [1]. However, the current legal uncertainty may pressure its valuation multiples, particularly if the EPA’s demands are upheld. A $140 million fine would represent approximately 1.5% of DTE’s 2025 market capitalization, but the reputational and operational costs could be far greater.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

The EES Coke case is a microcosm of the broader tension between industrial legacy and regulatory modernization. For DTE, the outcome of the September trial will not only determine its immediate financial exposure but also signal how courts and regulators will hold utilities accountable for environmental stewardship.

Investors must weigh these risks against DTE’s long-term strategy. While the company’s clean energy investments and regulated utility operations provide a buffer, the EES Coke litigation serves as a reminder that regulatory compliance is no longer a passive obligation—it is a dynamic, capital-intensive challenge that can redefine utility valuations. As the trial approaches, all eyes will be on Zug Island to see whether DTE can navigate this storm without sacrificing its position as a leader in the energy transition.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 02:00:27.552810

The Bucket Brigade has become one of the most visible opponents of industry in “Cancer Alley,” winning national recognition for forcing the cancellation of projects like the billion-dollar Wanhua chemical plant.","(The Center Square) − Louisiana’s industrial giants, ports and local governments are facing an increasingly coordinated barrage of lawsuits from small but determined groups.

From St. James to Cameron Parish, environmental justice organizations have dragged parish commissions, global corporations and state agencies into court.

One group, The Descendants Project, a nonprofit based in St. John the Baptist Parish, has filed at least three lawsuits in recent years over a Formosa Plastics zoning dispute. One targeted the parish government itself, while the other targeted Formosa. A third lawsuit related to the same dispute was filed against the Port of South Louisiana.

The disputed zoning change, passed unanimously in 1990, reclassified land in Wallace from residential to heavy industrial. The Descendants Project says the move was tainted by corruption tied to then-Parish President Lester Millet and aimed at benefiting Formosa Plastics.

The land is home to the graves of former enslaved Blacks. Their names were Simon, Betsy, Rachel, Stanley and Harry.

In July, The Descendants Project and Inclusive Louisiana filed suit against Formosa, saying that Formosa is violating the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by owning and controlling the bodies.

While such lawsuits are sometimes well intentioned, they are ""at least in part by a desire simply to burden the defendant or the defendant’s industry in some way,"" said Robert Stilson of the Capital Research Center. ""This might be through causing delays or increased costs, scoring public relations points, or attempting to achieve through litigation what those activists have been unable to achieve through legislation""

The Descendants Project also sued the Port of South Louisiana, accusing its board of secretly predetermining a vote on Greenfield’s grain elevator deal through email – a violation, they allege, of the state’s open meetings law.

Many of the lawsuits across the state include the same groups.

RISE St. James, Inclusive Louisiana, and the Mount Triumph Baptist Church, represented by the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, are pressing their case against St. James Parish and Koch. Koch and parish officials have asked the Louisiana Supreme Court to shut the case down and revive approvals for an expansion at Koch’s methanol plant.

The same three groups, also represented by Tulane, have a separate lawsuit against the parish saying it “discriminates against them by directing hazardous industrial facility development towards majority-Black districts and Black churches, where their members and congregants live.”

And just last week, another front opened in Cameron Parish, as reported by The Advocate. The Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club, and Environmental Integrity Project filed suit against the state Department of Environmental Quality for granting Venture Global a permit to build its Calcasieu Pass 2 liquefied natural gas facility.

“This company has been a bad neighbor and continually pollutes the air we breathe, while generating billions of dollars in profits,” resident and Sierra Club member John Allaire said in announcing the lawsuit.

The Sierra Club chapter of Louisiana, an environmental lobbying and legal group, has a long list of ongoing litigation against various big businesses.

""It’s disappointing to see nationally-backed activists try to litigate their agenda instead of working with local communities to understand the positive impact U.S. LNG brings to Louisiana and the world,” Venture Global wrote The Center Square in a statement.

The Bucket Brigade has also turned its firepower on New Orleans, suing the city and a development district in 2024 over a tax break deal for Shell Oil. The group says it was rushed through illegally and unfairly shifted tax burdens onto residents.

Taken together, the lawsuits reflect the strategy of a small but interconnected network of nonprofit groups that have reshaped environmental battles in south Louisiana.

The Descendants Project and Inclusive Louisiana have focused on challenging heavy industry expansion in St. John and St. James parishes, where descendants of enslaved people live in neighborhoods overshadowed by industrial development.

The Bucket Brigade has become one of the most visible opponents of industry in “Cancer Alley,” winning national recognition for forcing the cancellation of projects like the billion-dollar Wanhua chemical plant.

The Bucket Brigade, founded more than 20 years ago, has broadened its reach from oil refineries to liquefied natural gas export terminals, running campaigns that identify and train local residents to speak before federal regulators, track accidents, and rally community resistance.

In its filings, the group says it is building an “early warning network” across parishes most targeted for industrial growth, particularly majority-Black communities in St. James and St. John.

Some of these nonprofits are being bankrolled by an out-of-state foundation with an ironic stake in Big Oil. The Elizabeth B. and Arthur E. Roswell Foundation Inc., which as of 2023 held more than 6,800 shares of BP stock, has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into Louisiana’s grassroots groups.

Tax records show the Roswell Foundation gave $33,000 to the Descendants Project, $76,000 to the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and tens of thousands more to groups like Jubilee Justice in Alexandria, Rural Roots Louisiana, and Voice of the Experienced.

The foundation committed even larger future payments, including $90,000 to the Descendants Project, $120,000 to the Bucket Brigade, and $120,000 to Rural Roots Louisiana.

Cancer rates in Louisiana are among the highest in the nation and are often attributed to irresponsible business practices in the petrochemical industry, which has a massive presence in Louisiana.

These organizations were ""founded by and serving the descendant community of enslaved people who forcibly worked and died on plantations in the parishes along the Mississippi River in Louisiana under the cruel and inhumane system of slavery in the U.S. South,"" one lawsuit states.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_center_square_articles_912/033195098955249463992e64d010c25a,N,,2025-09-06 11:01:40.532086

This is after the Biden administration implemented policies to halt oil and natural gas permits nationwide and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last August vacated authorizations for LNG projects in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.

In response, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, led a bicameral and bipartisan group last year expressing support for LNG development in the RGV. Cruz, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño, Jr., also argued the court’s “unprecedented” revocation of already issued permits created “a new reality that threatens thousands of jobs, undermines economic growth in Texas, and, according to a former Obama Administration official, even puts future investment in renewable energy infrastructure at risk.”

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2023 had approved the construction and operation of Rio Grande LNG’s proposed LNG terminal project, Rio Grande LNG Terminal, and Rio Bravo Pipeline Company’s proposed pipeline project, Rio Bravo Pipeline Project, but three judges on the court vacated the approvals.

The Rio Grande LNG Project will develop, own, operate and maintain a natural gas pipeline system to access natural gas from the Agua Dulce Hub and an LNG export facility in south Texas. It’s slated to export 27 million tons of LNG a year to the global market. The Rio Grande LNG Terminal Project will provide LNG for truck transport and fueling operations.

The projects will create thousands of jobs and bring more than $18 billion in investment to South Texas, officials in support of the projects argue.

Fast forward to 2025, two months after President Donald Trump was sworn into office, the court reinstated FERC’s 2023 approvals.

In response, Cruz said the court “was right to reexamine its previous decision and restore these permits, which had already been issued and should never have been vacated.” The court’s decision last year “jeopardized 7,000 high-paying jobs and $24 billion in investment in the Rio Grande Valley, set a dangerous precedent for energy infrastructure development and investment nationwide, and needed to be revisited.”

Fast forward to this July, and FERC issued an environmental impact statement concluding “the projects would result in less than significant impacts.”

On August 29, FERC issued a final rule authorizing Rio Grande LNG Terminal construction to move forward. The rule states that the project “is not inconsistent with the public interest under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), and the Rio Bravo Pipeline Project is required by the public convenience and necessity under section 7 of the NGA.”

Cruz praised the FERC approval saying the new projects would strengthen “Texas’s energy leadership. Texas is the energy capital of the world, and I am proud to fight to ensure it stays that way.”

In order to prevent a court from revoking permits after they were already issued, Cruz, Cornyn and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, all Republicans from Houston, introduced the Protect LNG Act earlier this year.

The bill would prevent courts from halting LNG permits when a lawsuit is filed and require that the cases only be filed in the circuit court jurisdiction where the LNG facility is located, not the location of a federal agency that issues the requested permits. It also includes timelines for lawsuits among other stipulations, The Center Square reported.

Texas lawmakers led the charge to support LNG development in south Texas as Texas continues to lead the U.S. in oil and natural gas production and emissions reductions.

The U.S. leads the world in LNG exports, led by the Gulf states of Texas and Louisiana. In 2017, the U.S. became a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1957, “primarily because of increased LNG exports,” according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.

Three summers later, another budget bill is reshaping clean energy in the U.S.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) rolls back many of the clean energy provisions in the IRA, striking heavy blows to government support of solar, wind, electric vehicles (EVs), and energy efficiency. The good news, limited though it may be, is that the bill leaves the central provision for energy storage intact, with the investment tax credit (ITC) still available until the 2030s.

This article is part of POWER’s annual special edition published in partnership with the RE+ trade show. This year’s event is scheduled for Sept. 8-11, 2025, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Click here to read the entire special issue, and if you’re attending RE+, be sure to connect with the POWER team at our booth on Venetian Level 1—V3046.

Batteries did not, however, escape the IRA dismantling unscathed. Operators eyeing new battery projects now must adhere to the challenging Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) requirements to qualify for the ITC. The OBBBA especially squeezes operators whose projects are to be co-located with solar, as they’ll now need to either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or have their site in service by 2027 to qualify for the solar ITC.

The new provisions ultimately mean that, even with the ITC for battery storage still in place, it is more paramount than ever that operators extract the most revenue possible from their batteries. Analytics is one way to do that.

Lowering Upfront Cost

Battery storage already requires a significant upfront investment well before any post-energization revenue generation begins, and that investment level could rise as operators seek domestic suppliers to meet the ITC’s new FEOC requirements. Analytics software can help reduce the cost of storage projects even before installation through processes known as modeling and digital commissioning.

Using modeling through analytics, operators can determine exactly what size system they need for their site with advanced predictive software. This avoids a scenario where an operator may order more storage than necessary for their planned use case, and enables them to optimize their battery choices for a deployment focused on revenue-generating market services. With the stricter requirements for the ITC, it is more essential than ever to avoid the unnecessary expense of an oversized system.

Digital commissioning enabled by analytics (Figure 1) offers more cost control in the OBBBA era. With the deeper access to system- and cell-level data, analytics software can identify issues that may go unnoticed by conventional on-site commissioning. Digital commissioning could, for example, detect a malfunctioning cell early, helping to prevent more significant and costly downtime further down the line.

Unlocking Greater Revenue

With the OBBBA increasing costs for operators, especially those planning a solar + storage system, energy market participation offers one of the most promising ways to increase revenue from battery storage. Though options differ across America’s independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission organizations (RTOs), battery energy storage system (BESS) operators can enroll their installations in services such as arbitrage, frequency regulation, demand reduction, peak shaving, and reserve capacity.

Navigating these various programs can be daunting. While many energy management systems (EMS) support dispatch and basic market participation, they often lack the depth needed to optimize performance across diverse ISO/RTO markets. BESS analytics can complement EMS by helping operators coordinate how each storage asset participates in trading while taking into account technical constraints like degradation, state of charge (SoC), and thermal behavior. As market rules and rate structures shift, BESS analytics can automate the evaluation of participation opportunities and recommend adjustments that protect both profit and asset health.

Easing the path to energy markets is just one way that analytics help operators increase the return on investment (ROI) of their storage systems. During regular operations, analytics continuously monitor battery performance for anomalies that operators can address before they escalate into a critical issue. Analytics will catch an issue early that an EMS would find only when it requires taking the entire battery out of operation—and out of revenue-generation.

Analytics also helps operators determine which operating strategies are best for long-term revenue. Storage operations often emphasize short-term revenue, which has the tradeoff of accelerating battery degradation, leading to lower revenue over the battery’s lifetime. Analytics provides the tools for operators to maximize the life of their batteries, ultimately resulting in greater total revenue over time. A short-term revenue strategy also often leads to operators exceeding their battery’s warranty without realizing it—a situation analytics will alert operators to well in advance.

Compared to an EMS, analytics better gauges the true SoC of a battery, a critical element for revenue generation, as it reflects the battery’s usable capacity. EMS platforms typically rely on aggregate battery management system, or BMS, data, which can become less reliable under real-world conditions such as degradation or high cycling. In contrast, analytics use advanced modeling to estimate SoC based on cell-level behavior. True SoC is critical for delivering promised energy in market trading and ancillary services; without it, operators risk underperformance penalties and a significant hit to revenue.

Storage Revenue is More Critical Than Ever

The OBBBA dealt a brutal blow to the clean energy aspirations set in motion by the IRA, but it need not serve as a death knell for a maturing industry. Solar, wind, storage, and more will all be essential to preserving the stability of the electric grid. Storage, which retains its expanded ITC, offers a rare policy foothold amid broader rollbacks. Even so, rising costs and growing uncertainties are likely to challenge storage operators. Now more than ever, tools like battery analytics will play an increasingly important role in helping renewable energy projects reach their full potential.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/figure-1-twaice-usable-and-recoverable-energy.png,N,,2025-09-06 12:07:44.108975

For decades, the residents of the Ohio Valley have been paying for the aftermath of extractive industries. That “beautiful clean coal” Presidnet Donald Trump refers to took lives, and left a legacy of mine shafts and acid mine run-off. Taxpayers continue to foot the bills to plug orphan oil and gas wells and clean-up un-reclaimed strip mined lands.

Recently, the Ohio River Valley was targeted to become a carbon capture and sequestration hub. This hub will consist of a series of pipelines and Class VI injection wells that will theoretically allow industrial facilities to store carbon dioxide permanently underground. However, this technology has proven to be unsuccessful, expensive and dangerous. As usual, this hub comes with promises of jobs and economic development. Tenaska, the company which has received $55 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to help build this hub, held an open-house in Cadiz in July. However, there was no formal presentation and attendees left with more questions than answers.

Proponents of carbon capture are reluctant to share details about this technology and instead claim the industry will bring “millions of jobs and billions of investment dollars.” (see “Carbon capture can be an economic accelerator,” Aug. 23.). A report by the Ohio River Valley Institute believes the number of jobs are being greatly exaggerated. The hub is expected to “permanently employ a total of four people, according to an economic impact study commissioned and sponsored by Tenaska and prepared by West Virginia University’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research.”

Unlike enhanced oil recovery, an injection process that has been used for 40 years to recover residual oil in the western oil fields, carbon capture and sequestration is a relatively new process. Carbon dioxide will be captured from industrial sources, condensed to create a super critical fluid and delivered by pipelines to Class VI injection wells. Federal legislation for CCS Class VI wells was established in 2010 and since then, fewer than 30 wells nationally have received permits, and only two wells are operational. There are 12 Class VI well applications for Ohio, but no wells are in operation in the state. Additionally, no industries or power plants in Ohio have been retrofitted to capture carbon dioxide from their emissions, and no super critical state CO2 pipelines have been laid.

Numerous peer-reviewed studies show there are safety hazards and environmental concerns to consider from the capture site (power plants, ethanol plants, ammonia plants and steel mills) to the Class VI injection wells. The toxic chemicals needed to sequester the CO2 gas include lye and ammonia, and these must be produced, transported, handled and eventually disposed of in order to operate CCS at scale. These compounds threaten frontline communities. Some estimates say at least 900 miles of pipelines would be required to carry CO2 across the state from sources to the injection wells in Eastern Ohio.

Revisions to federal safety rules for CO2, written by the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration are still in limbo. In Satartia, Miss., 45 people were injured from a pipeline rupture. Studies have shown that leaks in the Class VI wells will release the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, nullifying any potential gains in reducing carbon emissions.

Leaks can also threaten groundwater, as was the case in recent accidents at Archer Daniel Midland in Illinois. Environmental groups and lawmakers were concerned that the Mahomet Aquifer, the sole source aquifer for the region and drinking water source for more than 1 million people, might become acidic and undrinkable. “Once CO2 dissolves in water, it forms carbonic acid, which lowers the pH of the water, eroding and corroding rock and well equipment, and mobilizing toxic metals such as lead, arsenic and mercury.”

Ohio has more than 36,000 orphan oil wells, which adds to the risks of injecting high pressure CO2 into Ohio’s Appalachian counties. A recent explosion during an orphan well capping operation in the Wayne National Forest speaks to the inherit dangers of these old wells. Ben Ebenhack, professor emeritus of petroleum engineering at Marietta College, said in a recent piece in the Marietta Times, “We don’t know where all these orphan wells are (some were plugged with wood)” and believes they pose “safety hazards for new drilling operations.”

The Marietta area also is dealing with brine wastewater from Class II wells infiltrating vertical oil and gas wells, as well as water wells in the Washington County area. How safe will our communities be if we start injecting 1,000 psi super critical carbon dioxide, a known asphyxiant, under more than 80,000 acres of our region where mines, vertical oil wells, brine injection wells and fracking wells exist?

Seismicity within the proposed carbon dioxide storage space could be problematic. According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Noble County in Southeastern Ohio recorded more than 70 earthquakes this year, second only to Washington County which recorded 76. “The presence of seismic activity, natural and induced, is of great importance when evaluating CO2 sequestration potential. Extensive fault zones may provide leakage pathways along which CO2 could migrate,” according to a study published in Environmental Geosciences.

CCS retrofits on power plants need significant amounts of water for cooling the additional equipment required to capture the CO2. They also will require up to 30 percent more energy. Taxpayers will be picking up the tab for costly retrofits to gas and coal power plants in the form of increased electricity bills. Taxpayers also will pay for the 45Q tax credits for carbon dioxide captured. The Inflation Reduction Act established rates per ton of CO2 sequestered at $85 per ton and the One Big Beautiful Bill kept these credits; even increasing some credits for CO2 used for enhanced oil recovery.

The Trump administration is trying to roll back environmental regulations that address climate change at the same time they are pushing for tax credits to capture the same emissions causing climate change. According to the Geoengineering Monitor, after decades of research, “there is no evidence that CCS can address the causes of the climate crisis or significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions” but it can put our communities at risk, leave us with the externalities and cost taxpayers billions of dollars.

Tesla reincorporated in Texas after a Delaware judge rejected Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package. Texas corporate law offers greater protection from legal challenges, allowing Tesla to propose a larger pay deal for Musk.

Delaware -Elon Musk's blow-out $1 trillion pay package from Tesla proves everything is bigger in Texas, especially under its new management-friendly law.

Last year, Tesla reincorporated in the Lone Star State after a judge in its former corporate home, Delaware, ruled a $56 billion compensation for the CEO was ""unfathomable"" and unfair to shareholders. Musk urged companies to ditch Delaware and his board worked on a new pay package.

Freed from the constraints of Delaware's widely used corporate law, Tesla has super-sized the next pay deal for Musk, already the world's richest person. Despite increasing his pay nearly 20-fold, there is a better chance this package will be approved and a lesser risk it will be struck down in the courts, thanks to Texas's corporate law.

In addition, it would be harder for shareholders to challenge the independence of the two board members who developed the pay package.

Unlike the 2018 pay package, this time around Musk will be allowed to use his voting power, which is around 13.5%, according to Friday's security filing. If recent history is a guide, that will lock in approval.

Live Events

Last year, the company's shareholders voted to ""ratify"" Musk's 2018 pay package in an attempt to essentially undo the court ruling and restore Musk's pay package. Musk will be able to vote about 411 million shares at this year's shareholder meeting, nearly outweighing the 529 million shares that voted against ratification.

In the end, the ratification vote did not matter because the Delaware judge ruled it did not override her prior decision. That ruling and her ruling striking Musk's $56 billion compensation are on appeal.

In 2018, the company barred Musk from voting his shares to make it harder for investors to sue under Delaware law.

Now Tesla does not need to do that because it has much better protection from legal challenges - the law in Texas, where it reincorporated last year.

""They are completely insulated from a shareholder lawsuit in Texas,"" said Ann Lipton, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School.

Tesla told investors last year in its pitch to approve its move from Delaware to Texas that laws in the two states were ""substantially equivalent"" and there was no reason to believe shareholders would have weaker litigation rights in Texas.

Things, however, changed in May when Texas lawmakers allowed companies to require shareholders to own 3% of a stock before they can sue.

Tesla quickly adopted a 3% bylaw. Musk is the only individual shareholder who meets that requirement. Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street do as well, but they are passive investors. Other investors could band together to reach the threshold.

By contrast, Delaware does not limit who can sue and many lawsuits are brought by investors with tiny stakes and the cases are overseen and funded by a handful of specialized law firms, which is a source of frustration to corporate boards. Richard Tornetta owned nine shares of Tesla when he sued over the 2018 pay package.

""We believe this bait-and-switch effectively was an effort to pull the wool over shareholders' eyes,"" the New York State Comptroller said in a proposal in Friday's proxy statement.

The comptroller is asking Tesla shareholders to repeal the 3% threshold at the annual meeting where shareholders will also vote on Musk's pay package.

Lipton said if shareholders do not like the pay package proposal, they still have an option. ""Sell,"" she said.

Aspen Power Acquires Projects in Illinois and New Jersey, Closes on Tax Equity Financing

This week was a busy one for distributed generation platform Aspen Power, which announced the acquisition of four projects in two states and closed on a new tax equity facility.

The company snapped up two community solar gardens in Illinois with a combined capacity of 13.9 megawatts direct current (MWdc). Located in Grafton and Mattoon, the projects are expected to generate over 19 million kilowatt-hours (kWh)- the clean energy equivalent to powering 2,770 homes each year.

The projects were acquired from Greenwood Sustainable Infrastructure (GSI) and are part of a larger portfolio spanning Illinois and New York, which also includes sites nearing final completion. Aspen Power recently closed on another 14.1 MW Illinois portfolio and has announced a partnership to acquire 20 additional community solar projects totaling up to 19 MW, primarily in Illinois.

Aspen Power also acquired two community solar projects in New Jersey totaling just over 1 MWdc solar capacity from Ecogy Energy. The projects, located in Millville (South Jersey) and Ocean Township (Monmouth County), were initially developed by Ecogy Energy and are approaching the start of construction. The acquisition is part of a series of deals Aspen Power announced spanning four states. The projects are in Atlantic City Electric and Jersey Central Power & Light utility territories and will provide subscribers with a discount on prevailing utility rates.

“Solar is the cheapest form of power available to Americans of all income levels,” reminded Jorge Vargas, Chief Executive Officer of Aspen Power.

“Collaboration is essential to accelerating the clean energy transition, and our partnership with Ecogy Energy demonstrates how working together can deliver results where they matter most,” stated Dan Gulick, Executive Vice President of Community Solar at Aspen Power.

“These projects are a great representation of Ecogy’s continued focus on developing the mid-market commercial and industrial distributed energy resources space,” added Jack Bertuzzi, Principal at Ecogy Energy. “It’s great to have a partnership with Aspen Power, who see the value in these distributed generation projects and the outsized value they bring to the grid and the surrounding communities.”

Aspen Power’s new tax equity facility is with Monarch Private Capital and will support solar project portfolios across New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, further advancing the company’s 2025 pipeline. Aspen Power has now secured a total of $66 million in tax equity commitments during the first eight months of 2025, aiming to reach gigawatt scale by mid-decade.

ClearGen Forges $150M Multi-Year Partnership For Community and Commercial Solar Projects

ClearGen Holdings, a sustainable infrastructure capital provider, has entered into a multi-year $150 million partnership with Davis Hill Development (DHD), a wholly owned subsidiary of Skyview Ventures, to finance community and commercial solar projects. The partnership will support the construction of DHD’s near-term distributed solar pipeline of over 245 MW in core Northeast and Mid-Atlantic markets and other targeted regions in the U.S.

The partnership is already underway, and the first joint project is expected to be operational by the end of this year. It’s a 292-kilowatt (kW) rooftop solar array on a warehouse building in Washington, D.C. that will feature 536 Longi 545W modules and is designed to avoid more than 213,000 pounds of CO₂ emissions annually, equivalent to offsetting 224 barrels of oil or powering 20 homes each year.

“This partnership gives us the committed capital to confidently execute our growing pipeline. As we scale, it’s important to align with partners who understand our vision and way of doing business. ClearGen brings the transparency, flexibility, and long-term support that help us grow while staying true to what makes our platform successful,” said Matt Coleman, CEO of Davis Hill Development.

On Thursday, British power company ContourGlobal celebrated the energization of its first U.S. project, the initial phase of Black Hollow Sun I, a 185 MW installation near Severance, Colorado, serving Platte River Power Authority, the community-owned utility serving Fort Collins, Loveland, Estes Park, and Longmont. The facility, located in Weld County, is about 16 miles east of Fort Collins. It was originally developed by Hanwha Renewables and acquired by ContourGlobal earlier this year.

ContourGlobal is also constructing the second part of the project, BHS II, which will add 139 MW and is expected to be completed by the end of 2026. Together, the tandem will constitute the largest photovoltaic installation in Northern Colorado and Platte River’s largest contracted solar asset. Combined, the projects will produce nearly 608 GWh of clean electricity annually, enough to power more than 73,000 homes and avoid almost 450,000 metric tons of CO₂ emissions each year.

“The start of operations at Black Hollow Sun I is a pivotal moment for ContourGlobal, marking our first U.S. renewable plant to reach operational state, and especially meaningful as we celebrate our 20th anniversary since the company was incorporated in the U.S.,” commented Antonio Cammisecra, CEO of ContourGlobal.

ContourGlobal is using American-manufactured solar modules supplied by its partner Qcells, which is also providing its integrated EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) solutions for this project. ContourGlobal’s overall U.S. portfolio now totals 2.8 GW of power generation capacity in operation, under construction, or in late-stage development. The company’s operational portfolio (1.5 GW) also includes a thermal fleet of 10 plants located in California, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as a light fuel oil plant in Connecticut.

Renewable Properties Announces New EV Fleet Charging Hub, Financing

Developer and investor Renewable Properties (RP) has closed on the purchase of land and a $20 million credit facility for a new electric vehicle (EV) charging hub for fleet vehicles in Richmond, California. The investment will also support RP’s development of nine other fleet charging depots in the San Francisco Bay Area, California’s Central Coast, and Chicago, Illinois.

The 4 MW Goodrick Avenue EV Depot project will commence construction in Q2 of 2026 and is expected to be completed by October 2027. It is being funded by a $20 million credit facility from a prominent family office investment firm. Renewable Properties has also received a $3 million grant from the Bay Area Air District to construct the fleet charging hub.

Located in an industrial infill area known for warehousing, distribution, and manufacturing, the Goodrick Avenue, Richmond location will become one of Renewable Properties’ first completed EV charging hubs for medium-duty EV truck fleets. Designed for commercial applications, such as delivery trucks, box trucks, utility service vehicles, and smaller buses, the facility will feature 60 charging stalls with 16 Level 3 DCFS chargers and 48 Level 2 chargers. The company expects additional committed capacity from PG&E in 2026, which will further expand the depot’s 4 MW of charging capacity.

“The Richmond charging hub is part of Renewable Properties’ expanded commitment to decarbonizing the transportation sector,” said Aaron Halimi, founder and President of Renewable Properties. “This launch will not only expand Bay Area EV fleet infrastructure, it will help lead a shift toward reducing diesel and gas emissions in high traffic corridors and support the health of disadvantaged communities.”

Renewable Properties also closed on $26.5 million in tax equity funding for its Fund 10 portfolio this week, expanding the company’s relationship with SOLCAP, KeyState’s tax equity investment platform.

Fund 10 includes three solar projects in California, totaling 17 MWdc. The projects have commenced construction and are scheduled for completion this year.

The 5.56 MWdc Redemeyer Road Solar Project in Ukiah, to be completed in Q4 2025, will incorporate a 4 MWdc/16 MWh energy storage system. Power from the Redemeyer project will be procured by community choice aggregator Sonoma Clean Power (SCP) as part of its EverGreen shared solar program, which allows customers to benefit from off-site solar, storage, and geothermal energy.

The Althea Avenue Solar Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects in Fresno County will complete construction by Q4 2025. Energy from the 6.42 MWdc Althea Solar Phase 1 project will contribute to the Disadvantaged Communities (DAC) Green Tariff program offered by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), which provides clean power to low to moderate-income-qualified residents with a 20% discount on their electric bills. The adjacent 5.02 MWdc Althea Phase 2 project is part of PG&E’s Solar Choice program, which allows customers to purchase solar energy to match either 50% or 100% of their energy use.

First Citizens Bank Provides $60 Million to Triple Oak Power

First Citizens Bank’s Energy Finance business has provided a $60 million credit facility to Triple Oak Power, a U.S.-based renewable energy developer backed by Energy Capital Partners, a leading investor in energy transition companies.

Triple Oak has an 8 GW pipeline of utility-scale onshore wind and hybrid projects currently under development. The new credit facility will be used to provide interconnection security postings for the development of renewable project assets. First Citizens Energy Finance served as coordinating lead arranger, administrative agent, and collateral agent for the transaction.

“First Citizens has a deep understanding of the renewable energy sector and the financing tools needed to bring large-scale projects to market,” noted Kenneth Labeja, co-founder and Chief Financial Officer of Triple Oak Power. “This financing was an important step in advancing our onshore wind portfolio, which is the cornerstone of our hybrid approach to project development.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FT-Template-15.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:06:46.373842

The week began with a subcommittee markup of the Labor-HHS-Education bill, in which Republicans approved cuts to some climate and health programs but bucked the Trump administration by increasing funding for low-income electricity assistance.

On Wednesday, the Appropriations Committee marked up its Financial Services-General Government bill, approving conservative riders on climate and battery initiatives — including one targeting a major battery plant in a GOP-led district.

And on Thursday, dozens of Republicans joined Democrats to block conservative amendments to the Energy-Water bill that proposed to slash funding for popular climate and environment programs. The bill squeaked through on the floor, 214-213, with no Democratic support and several Republicans voting against it.

The discord among Republicans is not new; it cropped up last year and forced GOP leadership to cancel a vote on the fiscal 2025 Energy-Water bill at the last minute. So far this year, it has not derailed Republicans’ aggressive push to pass appropriations bills on the floor.

But the disagreements over funding levels and the role the government should play in propping up various forms of energy underscore the challenge congressional leaders are up against in trying to strike deals to keep the government funded in a narrowly divided Congress.

Some of the intraparty fights have been somewhat symbolic, with Republicans pushing amendments that have no chance of passing to make a point.

Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) pushed a failed proposal to reduce energy and water funding by $37 billion and said many of the programs he was targeting “I actually don’t oppose.”

“It’s not about liking the appropriation,” Schweikert said. “It’s about budgetary discipline.”

But the dissonance is likely not helpful as congressional leaders look to put on a united front amid broader government funding talks. Democrats are already incensed at House Republicans for pursuing partisan bills.

One senior Democratic appropriator walked out of the House chamber after the vote on the Energy-Water bill Thursday shaking her head at what she perceived as Republican dysfunction.

“I wish the people who are the principle [critics of the spending bills] would cave earlier so we can all go home,” said House Appropriations ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.).

“In the long run, that’s what they always do,” DeLauro said. “This is just a charade.”

The Senate has passed three fiscal 2026 spending bills on the floor, all with bipartisan support. The upper chamber did not make any progress on appropriations this week, but the Senate Appropriations Committee is expected to meet next week to try to advance two more bills.

Bucking cuts to energy assistance

House Republican appropriators are advancing fiscal 2026 bills with steep cuts to Democratic priorities, but they have at times rejected the conservative funding levels the White House requested in its fiscal 2026 budget proposal.

The latest example came this week, when the House Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee advanced its spending bill with a $10 million increase to the popular Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, despite the fact that President Donald Trump wants to eliminate it.

Still, the Labor-HHS-Education bill would scrap funding for some of the Democrats’ favored climate and health programs and cut $40 million from the Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration.

“The bill supports the Trump Administration’s efforts to eliminate out-of-touch progressive policies, ends the weaponization of government, preserves parental rights, and upholds the right to life,” said House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.). “Each dollar is directed toward initiatives that truly help our communities, students, families, and workforce.”

The Senate’s version of the bill, which advanced out of committee with bipartisan support, would increase funding for LIHEAP by $20 million over the enacted level and generally maintain funding for the Mine Safety and Health Administration.

Both bills include more than $1 billion for environmental health programs administered by HHS. There are also provisions directing work on disaster resilience.

Ford plant, ESG under attack

The House Appropriations Committee advanced its Financial Services-General Government bill Wednesday after a day-long markup in which Republicans approved a number of amendments targeting Democratic climate priorities.

A GOP amendment package, adopted 32-28, included a provision that, if enacted, could effectively bar the federal government from buying vehicles from Ford and potentially Tesla — two of the most iconic and successful American automakers. Both have major plants in Republic-led districts.

The amendment would prohibit the General Services Administration from purchasing vehicles from any entity that has a contract or licensing agreement with certain Chinese companies, including Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), due to national security concerns. The Department of Defense has labeled CATL a Chinese military company, a description that CATL disputes.

Ford is licensing CATL technology for its Blue Oval battery manufacturing plant in a Michigan congressional district represented by Republican Rep. Tim Walberg.

The GSA owns and leases thousands of Ford vehicles and even purchased Ford electric trucks for use in Michigan parks during the Biden administration.

Republicans have hammered Ford for its decision to use the Chinese technology and worked to get Ford to end the agreement. CATL has reportedly worked with Tesla to provide faster charging batteries, meaning Tesla could be impacted, too, if the language becomes law. The EV maker is owned by Republican ally and donor Elon Musk.

Ford declined to provide a comment for this story. CATL did not respond to a request for comment.

The amendment package also contained two provisions adding new scrutiny to the practice of using environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in making financial decisions.

The amendment added new language to the bill report noting that the “Committee is concerned with the consideration of [ESG] criteria in bond markets and debt financing.”

It would require the SEC to issue a report outlining “the extent to which such practices may constrain a state’s or public entity’s ability to access capital and finance their debt.”

GOP blocks additional energy cuts

Thursday’s votes on the Energy-Water bill were the latest examples of the intraparty tensions among Republicans when it comes to energy and environment provisions.

Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), chair of the Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, pushed back on several amendments proposed by his Republican colleagues to water down his $57.3 billion bill.

He led the opposition against a number of Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry’s amendments seeking to reduce funding for regional commissions and to eliminate funding for various programs at the Department of Energy.

Perry requested votes on amendments that would have zeroed out money for DOE’s advanced energy research arm, blocked funding for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program and slashed the Loan Programs Office.

Fleischmann also spearheaded the bipartisan opposition to amendments that would have completely cut funds for DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), as well as Schweikert’s proposal to reduce the bill’s overall top line by $37 billion.

“I respectfully think my colleague’s amendment goes too far in eliminating this program,” Fleischmann said while noting that his bill would still cut EERE’s funding roughly in half.

“I think EERE is an [office] we all can support,” he said. “The reductions are there, and I think this strikes a very good balance.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/39/3d/f418e1a148a18815357c5a356ea6/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1690945483,N,,2025-09-06 02:00:14.377378

These and other issues have kept tensions high in Washington, but Republicans in and out of Congress largely remain behind President Trump.","Tariff Litigation.

On August 7th, the Trump administration’s reciprocal tariffs (ranging from 15% to 50%) on over 90 countries went into effect. Later in the month, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court’s ruling that those reciprocal tariffs were unconstitutional. The case now will be appealed to the Supreme Court by the Trump administration. Since, under the normal process, a ruling wouldn’t be made until later next spring, the Trump administration has pressed for expedited consideration. The appeals court’s decision allows the tariffs to stay in place until mid-October, and the Supreme Court could grant a similar stay to allow them to stay in place while it makes its decision. A ruling against the reciprocal tariffs by the Supreme Court would blow a big hole in the Trump administration’s trade strategy. The administration has imposed sectoral and other tariffs under other legal authorities, and could pivot to rely more on those. However, it would be more complicated and time-consuming to apply tariffs on such a broad basis.

Another Reconciliation Bill?

The final version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” increased the deficit by $4 trillion, roughly $600 billion more than the version passed by the House. Some House Republicans have been frustrated by this differential and are pushing for another reconciliation bill focusing on deficit reduction. There will be noise about this in the coming weeks. However, we believe that these efforts will fall short as most Republicans, most notably President Trump, are not on board with a deficit reduction bill of this size.

Another Tax Bill?

If there is another reconciliation bill, there will be interest in having it include additional tax measures, though President Trump generally succeeded in getting his tax priorities into the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Beyond reconciliation, there is some potential for a bipartisan tax bill later this year. During COVID, Congress expanded the eligibility for households with income above 400% of the federal poverty line to claim health insurance premium tax credits. These are set to expire at the end of the year. Some sort of renewal of this policy could serve as the basis for a bipartisan tax bill, though we are pessimistic about something significant materializing.

Nomination Frustration.

The confirmation of Trump administration nominees continues to be a hot topic given that the Senate has 130 nominations still outstanding. Senate Republicans are frustrated that Democrats have used Senate procedures to slow down the process. It’s not uncommon for the minority party in the Senate to take these measures, though it is less common with lower-level and relatively noncontroversial nominees. There are ongoing discussions about making certain procedural changes to speed up the process. Proposals include shortening the amount of debate time that must elapse between a procedural vote and a final vote, as well as reducing the number of executive branch roles subject to Senate confirmation. Senate Republicans could invoke the “nuclear option” by changing Senate rules with a simple majority vote. These discussions are fluid and we think there is a good chance that Senate Republicans will make changes to expedite approval of nominations.

Fed Drama.

For months, the Federal Reserve and its Chairman Jay Powell have been targets of President Trump. The president has jawboned the Fed on cutting interest rates and has complained about the cost of a renovation of the Fed’s facilities. More recently, President Trump took the unprecedented step of trying to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook (on the grounds of alleged mortgage fraud). The attempted firing is now the subject of lengthy litigation that is likely to go up to the Supreme Court. Economists and others have expressed concerns that the attacks on the Fed could erode its independence and therefore credibility. This issue provided the backdrop of a Senate hearing on the nomination of Stephen Miran (currently serving as head of the Council of Economic Advisors) to fill a temporary vacancy at the Federal Reserve. Republicans are trying to quickly push through Miran’s nomination. The bigger change will come in May when Chairman Powell’s term expires. President Trump has made no secret of his interest in replacing Powell and could name a replacement for Powell well in advance of May. In the meantime, the intrigue and criticism will continue.

Tensions Flaring.

Since Congress recessed at the end of July, a number of issues have stoked tension between the two parties (and sometimes within the parties). There will continue to be calls and efforts by many lawmakers to force the release of all files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Additionally, President Trump’s use of the National Guard in Washington to combat crime and his threat to use the guard in other cities has divided lawmakers along party lines. Other controversies include the aforementioned legal fight regarding the firing of Fed Governor Cook and questions about HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s leadership after his firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and changes to vaccination policies. These and other issues have kept tensions high in Washington, but Republicans in and out of Congress largely remain behind President Trump.

Government in the Boardroom.

In a departure from traditional US economic policy, the federal government has taken direct equity stakes in private companies, most notably the conversion of prior grants into a 10% share in Intel last month. The Trump administration has expressed interest in starting a sovereign wealth fund and having the government become a shareholder in more US companies, with defense contractors being eyed as the government is their main customer. While this isn’t the first time the US government has invested in private companies, many of the prior instances (e.g. investments in banks and auto companies during the financial crisis) were structured differently and intended to be temporary. While the Trump administration’s investments are outside of traditional Republican economic orthodoxy, some progressives have praised these efforts. As the line between private and public blurs, the coming years will test both the ambition and limits of this ""government as stakeholder"" model.

Congressional Stock Trading?

The buzz around Congress and the long-debated issue of stock trading by lawmakers continues. While this issue has arisen before, there’s now a growing set of bipartisan bills aimed at limiting, or banning, Members of Congress from trading stock. Comprehensive legislation introduced this week would force Members of Congress (and their families) to divest or use blind trusts. It would impose those same strictures on the President and Vice President, though, as currently written, these requirements only would apply to future presidents and vice presidents. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) have both conveyed qualified support for legislation to prevent Members of Congress from stock trading, but that’s not a guarantee they’ll support this particular effort. This is especially the case if President Trump comes out against the bill. The bill’s sponsors argue that the public’s overwhelming support (86% according to recent polls) makes an eventual ban inevitable. While Congress’s near-term preoccupation will be government funding, this issue could boil over towards the end of the year.",https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/washington-weekly/2025/washington-weekly-5-september/_jcr_content/root/pagehead/opengraphimage.1423544471.img/washington-weekly-c.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 08:59:55.275446

Hyundai's Savannah, Georgia Metaplant is the South Korean automaker's newest and arguably most important factory ever, making the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 electric SUVs on American soil. Today, however, it was the site of the largest-ever Homeland Security enforcement operation at a single location.

Earlier today, the 16 million square-foot factory was raided by law enforcement officers, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who arrested about 475 people. Most were South Korean nationals who were not in the country legally, according to multiple news reports.

In a statement to InsideEVs, Hyundai Motor America officials confirmed that none of the workers detained were employed by the Korean automaker. Instead, they seem to have been working for LG Energy Solution, which co-owns the plant with Hyundai and operates its nearby battery facility.

""We are closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances,"" Hyundai officials said. ""Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company.""

The automaker added: ""Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.""

A Hyundai spokesperson said that vehicle assembly at the plant will not be affected by today's arrests.

Hyundai officials said the company is ""reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors."" It was not immediately clear why the EV and battery manufatcuring site was targeted by the Trump administration.

Today's raid comes as the Trump administration continues to dramatically step up immigration-related detentions, arrests and deportations across the country. While Trump campaigned on a promise to deport criminals and ""the worst of the worst,"" many such raids have implicated scores of people who have not been accused of crimes. According to a New York Times report, an attorney for at least two detained suspects today in Georgia said they were in the United States on a visa waiver program that allows stays of 90 days or less for business.

The Times report indicated that Korean companies often bring their own technicians on-site to help set up new operations, as they have the training to do such work. But one immigration lawyer said U.S. visa laws are not properly set up to sponsor trained workers to run those factories.

However, ICE officials said in a statement that the raid was part of ""an active, ongoing criminal investigation.""

""The individuals arrested during the operation were found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses,"" ICE officials said. ""People on short-term or recreational visas are not authorized to work in the U.S. A green card holder from Mexico was arrested after being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions.""

Hyundai's Metaplant is perhaps the automaker's most important effort to bolster manufacturing in the U.S., its largest and most important market. It is also the largest economic development project in Georgia's history. The scale of the project, and its planned 14,000 manufacturing jobs, have been hailed as a win by Democrats and Republicans alike. Hyundai also announced this year that the plant can make hybrid cars, amid potential concerns about electric demand following the end of the federal EV tax credits later this month.

""The safety and well-being of everyone working at our sites, whether directly employed by us or working for our suppliers, is a top priority,"" Hyundai officials said. ""We take our responsibility as a corporate citizen seriously, and incidents like this remind us of the importance of robust oversight throughout our entire supply chain and contractor network.""",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/L3XXmN/s1/hyundai-metaplant-top.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 23:58:32.927404

Outer Continental Shelf, effectively terminating federal plans for offshore wind development across more than 3.5 million acres of ocean waters.
These projections now face uncertainty as the Trump administration reverses the previous administration’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030.
The Interior Department promised “more meaningful consultation” with tribes, fishing communities, and coastal towns regarding any future offshore energy development.
The administration’s actions represent a significant policy reversal from federal offshore wind development that had been planned and studied since 2014.","The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management announced this week it has rescinded all designated Wind Energy Areas on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, effectively terminating federal plans for offshore wind development across more than 3.5 million acres of ocean waters.

The sweeping decision eliminates 11 previously designated areas spanning multiple regions, including the Gulf of America, North Carolina coast, Gulf of Maine, Oregon, and California’s Morro Bay. The canceled zones include four areas off Texas and Louisiana, three off North Carolina, approximately 2 million acres in New England waters, and two floating wind areas totaling 195,000 acres off Oregon.

“By rescinding WEAs, BOEM is ending the federal practice of designating large areas of the OCS for speculative wind development,” the agency stated in its announcement.

The action follows Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s Order 3437, which aims to end “preferential treatment for unreliable, foreign controlled energy sources” in federal decision-making. This builds on President Trump’s January 20 presidential memorandum that temporarily withdrew all Outer Continental Shelf areas from offshore wind leasing.

The offshore wind industry had projected $65 billion in investments by 2030, supporting an estimated 56,000 jobs with significant benefits for U.S. shipbuilding and maritime operations. These projections now face uncertainty as the Trump administration reverses the previous administration’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030.

Commercial fishing groups have welcomed the decision. The New England Fishermen’s Stewardship Association and other fishing organizations have long argued that offshore wind projects disrupt marine ecosystems and traditional fishing grounds. Fishermen have raised concerns about electromagnetic fields from underwater cables affecting lobster larvae and turbine-related water disturbances impacting fish populations.

The decision also addresses concerns about whale mortality along the East Coast, which some fishing advocates have linked to offshore wind surveying activities.

While existing lease rights remain unaffected, the order mandates comprehensive review of current wind energy leases for potential termination or amendment. The Interior Department promised “more meaningful consultation” with tribes, fishing communities, and coastal towns regarding any future offshore energy development.

Instead, it’s promoting a return to “big beautiful coal” and natural gas (NGV25) to fuel American power plants.
Just remember that it’ll take years before the effects of this capacity increase start to shave down your energy bills.
When Will Power Bills Come Back Down?
Analysts are forecasting investments in America’s national grid to balloon energy bills right into 2030.","Better infrastructure should make transmission cheaper in the future. But for now, these upgrades are going to make your bills more expensive.

Although the DoE has agreed to help out a little bit, power companies are still spending billions trying to upgrade regional systems piece by piece. To keep shareholders from jumping ship, they're passing the cost of upgrades directly onto monthly rate payers.

Worst of all, these projects have multi-year pipelines and costs tend to spiral. Permitting delays, equipment shortages, and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have slowed upgrade efforts in many parts of the country.

That means these expansion efforts aren’t going to come to fruition anytime soon. Instead, they’ll just continue to inflate your electricity bills.

Demand Has Ballooned

There are some amazing tech innovations disrupting daily life. Huge data centers, AI, and a steady rise in electric vehicle uptake have pushed demand for electricity higher than ever.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) issued a new consumption forecast warning it expects a 1.7% annual rise in demand over the next two years.

That doesn’t look like a huge rise at first glance. But zoom in for some extra context, and you’ll see that U.S. electricity consumption only increased by around 0.1% between 2005 and 2020. So that 1.7% rise is actually a dramatic shift.

Average temperatures have continued to climb, which will push up demand for cooling systems and heat pumps. A lot of these systems guzzle electricity, which will create further supply imbalances.

What Is the Trump Admin Saying About Power Bills?

Earlier this week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told reporters that tackling soaring electricity prices was his top concern. So, what is the Trump administration actually doing to bring prices down?

Aside from the usual political blame game, there’s been a huge pivot in recent months away from clean energy.

The DoE has canceled offshore wind funding and pulled billions in green energy grants. The administration has also rewritten tax credits and torn apart energy-efficiency standards like ENERGY STAR.

Instead, it’s promoting a return to “big beautiful coal” and natural gas (NGV25) to fuel American power plants.

Over 4.3 GW of natural gas generation projects have now been started or are in pre-construction. That’s more than twice the amount of natural gas generation projects that were built last year — and developers are planning to bring four new power plants online to add a total of 18.7 GW by 2028.

These capacity increases should have the desired effect (eventually).

These projects will likely create a positive tailwind for billpayers when they come to fruition. Just remember that it’ll take years before the effects of this capacity increase start to shave down your energy bills. So in the meantime, billpayers don’t have a whole lot to look forward to.

When Will Power Bills Come Back Down?

This isn’t an answer families are going to want to hear. But no one’s expecting energy bills to come down in the short term — and by short term, we’re not talking about the next few months. We’re talking about the next three years.

Analysts are forecasting investments in America’s national grid to balloon energy bills right into 2030. These big infrastructure projects take a long time. Network upgrade costs will keep trickling down to rate payers until utility companies start to realize a profit on those investments.

And while production capacity is set to increase significantly over the next three years, the U.S. is simultaneously consolidating its reliance on natural gas as its primary source of electricity generation. There’s an inherent risk there, and it'll probably hurt prices in the short term.

The Trump administration and the DoE are keen to increase domestic production of natural gas throughout Trump’s second term, and this could push prices down a bit. But there are also geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors at play that'll likely drive prices right back up.

Based on everything that’s happened over the last five years, nobody expects a glorious return to the era of cheap gas anytime this decade.

Of course, there’s a bit of a ZIP code lottery here, too. Some energy customers might see regional variations in prices thanks to local energy mixes or regulatory changes. If you're lucky, that could work in your favor.

But generally speaking, most of us just need to adapt. Energy bills are going to keep outpacing inflation. All signs indicate this is going to be the new normal for the next three to five years. So, your best bet at reducing your bills is to focus on improving your own individual energy efficiency.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0xB7usf3IrI3kYKgHGyypw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/barchart_com_477/6c242dade169cad237b60f738ee1cf7f,N,,2025-09-06 03:00:27.823295

Federal agents walked into a massive Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions construction site yesterday and detained nearly 500 people on suspected immigration offenses. The site, near Savannah, Georgia, is the home of a future electric vehicle battery plant. On Instagram, video posted by an account with the name Alex Morales showed a group of people listening to a masked man who identifies himself as part of Homeland Security.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED DHS OFFICER: We need construction to cease immediately. We need all work to end on the site right now.

DETROW: Homeland Security Investigations says this was the largest single-site operation they have ever carried out. NPR's Camila Domonoske covers cars for NPR and joins us now. Hey there.

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi.

DETROW: What do we know about this workplace raid so far?

DOMONOSKE: Yeah. So Homeland Security Investigations, which is the branch of ICE that carries out this kind of workplace raid, they say that they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean. Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions - both of those companies are headquartered in South Korea. Here's Special Agent Steven Schrank speaking at a press conference.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVEN SCHRANK: Some that illegally crossed the border into the United States, some that came in through visa waiver and were prohibited from working, some that had visas and overstayed their visas.

DETROW: So who was employing the people who were detained?

DOMONOSKE: It's a good question. You know, in a project like this, there are really complicated webs of subcontractors and subcontractors to subcontractors. Hyundai says that it believes that nobody detained was directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. LG Energy Solutions hasn't responded to NPR's requests for comment.

That Homeland Security official said that this raid was tied to, quote, ""allegations of unlawful employment practices and serious federal crimes,"" end quote. He did not provide more details on that, and there are no charges filed in this case right now. Officials say this is an ongoing investigation. It would be unusual if charges are eventually filed because immigration raids like this, where workers are detained - they don't often end with criminal charges for employers.

DETROW: Tell us more about where this raid happened.

DOMONOSKE: It's on this huge campus of buildings near Savannah, Georgia, that also includes a large factory where Hyundai is right now building electric vehicles. That factory was not directly affected by the raid. Production of vehicles didn't actually stop. But the battery plant that's under construction nearby, which is where the raid actually happened - it's an important part of the long-term plans for this facility 'cause the goal is to build not just electric vehicles, but the whole supply chain for these vehicles here in the U.S.

And that's important not just to Hyundai, but actually to the United States more broadly in this effort to try to compete with China over the future of electric vehicles. So Hyundai is investing some $26 billion in moving manufacturing to the U.S., including this project. It's a big deal for the company and for Georgia. The state's called it the largest economic development project in state history.

DETROW: And I understand you just heard back from Hyundai. What did they say?

DOMONOSKE: They said they're going to conduct an investigation into suppliers and their subcontractors to make sure they are all following employment law and other laws and regulations. Meanwhile, Congressman Buddy Carter, who represents the area surrounding the plant, posted on X that he applauded the Trump administration for taking bold action. And the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it voiced concerns to the United States about respecting South Korean economic activity and citizens.

DETROW: That is NPR's Camila Domonoske. Thank you so much.

DOMONOSKE: Thank you.

Oklo Plans $1.68 Billion Fuel Center in TN

Oklo Announces Fuel Recycling Facility as First Phase of up to $1.68 Billion Advanced Fuel Center in Tennessee

Nation’s first privately funded facility to recycle used nuclear fuel will help reduce costs, create jobs, and establish a durable U.S. fuel supply.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) an advanced nuclear technology company,announced plans to design, build, and operate a fuel recycling facility in Tennessee as the first phase of an advanced fuel center.

The firm will organize an investment totaling up to $1.68 billion. The initial investment will be for the construction of a facility to recycle used nuclear fuel into fuel for fast reactors like Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse advanced reactor.

The recycling facility will recover usable fuel material from used nuclear fuel and fabricate it into fuel for advanced reactors. This process can reduce waste volumes for more economical, clean, and efficient disposal pathways.

The fuel recycling facility is the first phase of Oklo’s broader advanced fuel center, a multi-facility campus aimed at supporting recycling and fuel fabrication.

Oklo is also exploring opportunities with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to recycle the utility’s used fuel at the new facility and to evaluate potential power sales from future Oklo powerhouses in the region to TVA.

Oklo has completed a licensing project plan for the fuel recycling facility with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is currently in pre-application engagement with the regulator’s staff.

The facility in Tennessee is expected to begin producing metal fuel for Aurora powerhouses by the early 2030s, following regulatory review and approvals.

This collaboration would mark the first time a U.S. utility has explored recycling its used fuel into clean electricity using modern electrochemical processes, turning a legacy liability into a resource while creating a secure fuel supply for the future.

“Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo co-founder and CEO.

“By recycling used fuel at scale, we are turning waste into gigawatts, reducing costs, and establishing a secure U.S. supply chain that will support the deployment of clean, reliable, and affordable power.”

The more than 94,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel stored at power plant sites around the country contain considerable reserves of recyclable fuel. The energy that can be unlocked from this material via recycling is equivalent to about 1.3 trillion barrels of oil, or five times the reserves of Saudi Arabia.

Separately, in July, Oklo successfully completed pre-application readiness assessment for Phase 1 of the combined license application for Oklo’s first commercial Aurora powerhouse.

Oklo CEO and Co-founder Jacob DeWitte at the announcement of Oklo’s planned advanced nuclear fuel center in Oak Ridge, TN, with the Governor of Tennessee Bill Lee, the Commissioner of the Department of Economic and Community Development Stuart C. McWhorter, United States Senators from Tennessee Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, Nuclear Regulatory Commission Commissioner Bradley Crowell, and Member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Tennessee’s 3rd district Chuck Fleischmann.

“Tennessee is well positioned to lead America’s energy independence, which is why we created the Nuclear Energy Fund to support and expand our state’s nuclear ecosystem. We’re proud to partner with Oklo to innovate for the future, while bringing continued opportunity and prosperity to Tennessee families,” said Governor Bill Lee.

Oklo Claims to Have a Fuel Recycling Process. How does it Work?

Oklo’s nuclear fuel recycling process is a type of pyroprocessing that uses an electrochemical process to separate usable fuel from spent nuclear waste. This technology, which is being developed in collaboration with U.S. national laboratories, allows Oklo to extract more than 90% of the remaining energy from used fuel and turn it into new fuel for its advanced fast reactors, like the Aurora powerhouse.

How the Process Works

Oklo’s process differs from traditional aqueous reprocessing methods because it’s a dry process that doesn’t use large amounts of water or chemical solvents. Instead, it involves electrorefining, a technique that has been demonstrated at the Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL) Fuel Conditioning Facility.

Electrorefining

In this process, used nuclear fuel is submerged in a bath of molten salt. An electrical current is then applied to the salt, which causes the usable elements in the fuel, like uranium and transuranics (e.g., plutonium), to migrate and collect on a cathode. This process separates the reusable material from the highly radioactive fission products, which remain in the molten salt.

Fuel Fabrication

The separated material, which is a mixture of uranium and transuranics, is then fabricated into new metal fuel for Oklo’s fast reactors. The process is designed to be proliferation-resistant because it keeps the transuranic materials together and doesn’t create a pure stream of plutonium.

Waste Reduction

By recycling the fuel, Oklo significantly reduces the volume of high-level radioactive waste that needs to be stored long-term, making disposal more economical and efficient.

This recycling technology is a key part of Oklo’s business model, aiming to provide a secure domestic fuel supply, reduce costs, and convert what is currently a liability—used nuclear fuel—into a valuable resource for generating clean energy.

Technical Challenges to Commercialization

While pyroprocessing has a strong historical foundation, its demonstration at the EBR-II was at a laboratory scale. Scaling this process to an industrial level for commercial operation is a major technical and financial hurdle.

The process operates in an extremely harsh environment, with high temperatures of 500-700°C and highly corrosive molten salts. The entire operation must be conducted remotely within heavily shielded “hot cells” due to the extreme radioactivity of the materials, adding significant complexity and cost to the facility’s design and operation.

Economic Viability and Cost

Oklo’s narrative of “reducing costs” stands in contrast to a broader academic and expert debate about the economic viability of reprocessing. Research indicates that reprocessing is not currently cost-competitive with the “once-through” fuel cycle, particularly with today’s low uranium prices.

Oklo’s economic model does not appear to be based on the immediate market value of the recovered uranium, but rather on a long-term strategic value proposition. The model implicitly places a significant value on a closed fuel cycle and the elimination of a long-term waste management liability, making it a bet on future market conditions and regulatory frameworks rather than on present economic realities.

Kairos Power And BWXT MOU on Commercial Triso Manufacturing

The Kairos Power-BWXT team will work together to explore opportunities for the optimization of commercial production of TRISO fuel for Hermes 2 and future commercial reactors

Kairos Power and BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BWXT) announced an agreement to collaboratively explore technical and process opportunities for the optimization of commercial production of TRISO nuclear fuel to supply Kairos Power’s advanced reactor fleet and other potential customers.

The arrangement will bring together Kairos Power’s established capabilities in annular graphite pebble production with BWXT’s more than 20 years of experience in TRISO fuel manufacturing and will consider possible paths to deliver fuel for the Hermes 2 Demonstration Plant and subsequent Kairos Power reactor deployments.

Kairos Power’s Fluoride Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Reactor (KP-FHR) uses TRISO fuel embedded in annular graphite pebbles roughly the size of a golf ball.

Under the collaboration agreement, the joint team will explore opportunities to utilize the state-of-the-art TRISO Development Lab (TDL) at Kairos Power’s Albuquerque campus, the BWXT Innovation Campus in Lynchburg, Virginia, and BWXT’s existing TRISO production line to optimize TRISO fuel manufacturing and process automation.

The companies have also agreed to explore opportunities to jointly develop a TRISO fuel fabrication facility, which would incorporate this experience and knowledge, along with newly developed technology for commercial fuel production.

This combined fuel manufacturing knowledge and expertise creates the opportunity to develop efficient and cost-effective mass-produced TRISO coated particle fuel to support Kairos Power’s commercial scale-up and lower fuel costs for the advanced reactor industry.

TRISO (TRi-structural ISOtropic) particle fuel is a proven technology developed by the U.S. Department of Energy, which has dubbed it “the most robust nuclear fuel on earth.” Each TRISO particle is made up of a uranium, carbon, and oxygen fuel kernel encapsulated by three layers of carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of radioactive fission products. By combining TRISO fuel with molten fluoride salt coolant, Kairos Power’s advanced reactor technology achieves robust inherent safety in a simplified, compact design.

US Uranium Unveils UF6 Conversion Facility Plans

(WNN) The proposed facility – which UEC says will be the largest conversion facility in the USA and “amongst the most modern in the Western world” – is envisaged as having a designed capacity to produce some 10,000 tU per year as UF6, representing a “substantial share” of the USA’s 18,000 tU per year demand.

The proposed facility is the result of work initiated with Fluor Corporation in July 2024 and supported by a recently completed AACE Class 5 conceptual study. UEC said it has initiated discussions on potential siting options, “evaluating factors such as logistics, workforce availability, public acceptance, local incentives, and synergies with other fuel cycle facilities.”

“The project will move forward contingent on several factors, including completion and assessment of additional engineering and economic studies, securing strategic government commitments, utility contracts, regulatory approvals, and favorable market conditions,” the company said.

“UEC has begun initial discussions with the United States government, state-level energy authorities, utilities, and financial entities, and will report further updates as these engagements advance.”

UEC Gets a New Name

Texas-headquartered UEC said the new company will be called United States Uranium Refining & Conversion Corp. (UR&C). Onshoring the nuclear fuel cycle is seen as a priority for national security.

“Positioning UEC as the only vertically integrated US company with uranium mining, processing, refining and conversion capabilities is both a significant commercial opportunity and a strategic necessity for the United States,” UEC President and CEO Amir Adnani said.

“UEC’s end-to-end capabilities would provide a secure, geopolitically reliable source of uranium hexafluoride – the feedstock needed for uranium enrichment to produce nuclear fuel – for “undersupplied domestic and allied markets.”

Conversion is a chemical process to refine U3O8 to uranium dioxide, which can then be converted into uranium hexafluoride gas. Honeywell’s Metropolis Works plant, built in the 1950s in southern Illinois, is currently the only uranium conversion facility in the USA. It was temporarily shut down from 2017 to 2023 due to poor market conditions, but was restarted in July 2023.

UEC has three hub and spoke in-situ recovery uranium platforms in South Texas and Wyoming with a combined licensed production capacity of 12.1 million pounds U3O8 (4654 tU) per year.

The facility will position UEC as the only American company with a nuclear fuel supply chain capability from uranium production to refining, conversion, and delivery of natural UF6, the company said.

High conversion prices in both the spot and long-term markets are “indicative of a highly undersupplied market and a major bottleneck in the US nuclear fuel supply chain, and market conditions, plus current federal government support, have created a “prime opportunity” for a US company to develop a new uranium refining and conversion plant, it added.

Fermi America Closes $350 Million in Series C Financing

Fermi America, developing the world’s largest, behind-the-meter artificial intelligence private grid campus (the “HyperGrid Project”), in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, announced the successful close of its $100 million Series C preferred equity financing round led by Macquarie Group, alongside the establishment of a $250 million senior loan facility, funded solely by Macquarie’s Commodities and Global Markets business, with $100 million drawn at close.

This financing marks a major milestone for Fermi America to secure long-lead supply chain assets..

The company said in its press statement the Series C equity round and senior loan facility “provide a strong foundation for Fermi America to continue locking up global long-lead time items, adding subject matter experts to the Fermi team, and constructing phase one of the HyperGrid Project.”

About the FERMI Project

The Texas Firm, led by former DOE Secretary Rick Perry plans to build four 1,150 MW (4.6 GW) Westinghouse AP1000 PWR type nuclear reactors at a 5,700 acre site adjacent to the NNSA Pantex nuclear weapons depot in Amarillo, TX, which is 360 miles northwest of Dallas, TX.

According to its press statement, the project is expected to have its first reactor, of the four, in revenue service by 2032. Until then the facility will rely on natural gas and solar energy for electricity. Amarillo is home to a large and productive gas field. The gas plants are quicker to build and construction of them can scale to electricity demand by the data centers until it is sufficient to justify building the reactors.

Given the timeline for a nuclear new build at this scale, it could be 2040 or later before all four reactors are in revenue service. The 2032 date provided by Fermi American for the first reactor is likely to be subject to change.

By partnering with the Texas Tech University, by leasing the site for 99 years, project developers will be able to leverage a legal authority of the State of Texas called “Sovereign Ovenership” which is expected to clear away delays related to water and mineral rights and local zoning.

The site is expected to host so-called hyperscale data centers based on “behind the meter connections” which will likely mean most of the power generated by the reactors will not go on the Texas electrical power grid. Amarillo is not part of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. ERCOT, which covers most of the state.

Poland’s Orlen And Synthos Agree to Joint Venture for 1st BWRX-300 Nuclear Plant

Companies say Europe’s first small modular reactor will be built near city of Wloclawek

(NucNet) Polish companies Orlen and Synthos Green Energy (SGE) have agreed on a new operating model for their joint venture Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE), paving the way for construction of Poland’s first BWRX-300 small modular reactor (SMR) near the central city of Wloclawek.

The new model means state-controlled energy company Orlen and privately owned SGE will each hold 50% of the shares and have equal rights in OSGE, including the ability to alternately appoint the chief executive officer and chairman.

Another element of the agreement is a licensing agreement that gives OSGE direct access to the BWRX-300 technology, developed by them US company GE Vernova (GEV).

The new OSGE structure introduces a steering committee responsible for overseeing project implementation and making operational decisions. The committee will also support the creation of additional special purpose vehicles responsible for the construction of additional reactors.

In December 2023, OSGE received a decision-in-principle for the construction of up to 24 SMRs at six potential sites across the country. Those six sites included Wloclawek.

Orlen Planning Up To 600 MW Of Capacity By 2035

In January 2024, Orlen laid out plans for deploying two reactors with about 600 MW of nuclear power capacity by 2035.

OSGE also signed an agreement with the Polish Data Center Association to explore the integration of SMRs with data centre infrastructure in Poland.

SGE chief executive officer Rafal Kasprów, who is also CEO of OSGE, told NucNet recently that SGE is building partnerships in Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the UK as it seeks to expand its footprint and deploy new-generation reactors across Europe.

With peak electricity demand expected to grow and coal capacity rapidly exiting the system, Poland faces one of Europe’s most acute energy crises.

Kasprów said: “Poland can’t keep up with new consumption. We must replace coal with reliable baseload – and that’s what SMRs offer.”

The BWRX-300 is a 300-MW water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems. It is based on an existing boiling water reactor design – the ESBWR – that is licensed in the US.

NASA Posts Lunar Nuclear Plan with Commercial Focus

(Space News)(NASA) NASA is moving ahead with plans to support development of a lunar nuclear power system with an emphasis on commercialization.

On 08/29/25 the agency released a draft Announcement for Partnership Proposals, or AFPP, for its Fission Surface Power initiative to gather industry input for the final version.

The AFPP is designed to implement a policy directive signed July 31 by Acting Administrator Sean Duffy that seeks to accelerate work on nuclear power systems for the moon. The directive calls for a reactor capable of producing at least 100 kilowatts of power that would be ready for launch by the end of 2029.

NASA plans to pursue the effort through public-private partnerships using funded Space Act Agreements. While the directive called for selecting two companies, the draft AFPP states NASA can choose “one, multiple or none” of the proposals.

The draft provides few new details about NASA’s requirements. One, restated from the directive, is that the system will use a closed Brayton cycle power conversion system — a signal, industry officials said, that NASA wants the technology to scale to higher-power systems.

The reactor would operate in the lunar south polar region for at least 10 years. A cover letter accompanying the draft seeks input on issues including cybersecurity, physical security and reactor fuel.

Under the Space Act Agreement structure, the company would own the reactor and sell power to NASA and other customers. The AFPP requires proposers to submit a financing plan “showing how cash from operations, financing, and NASA covers the expenses of the total end-to-end deployment of the FSP system.”

Proposers must also provide a “Commercial Lunar Power Business Plan” outlining the strategy, potential customers and market size. “The market should include or leverage customers other than NASA,” the draft states.

That approach also extends to delivery. Companies may propose that NASA land the reactor on the moon, if it weighs no more than 15,000 kilograms. But the AFPP says companies “that propose a wholly commercial approach to the end-to-end deployment, all other things being equal, will receive higher-rated proposal evaluations.”

The draft does not state how much funding NASA expects to provide but says the final version, due no later than Oct. 3, will include that information. Awards are expected by March 2026.

The directive followed a report commissioned by the Idaho National Laboratory that recommended accelerating space nuclear power development.

Why the BMW iX3 deserves your attention right now

This is not a concept locked behind velvet ropes it is the BMW iX3, the first Neue Klasse production model. It arrives at a moment when buyers are demanding more from electric vehicles than ever before. Long range, fast charging, and genuine usability are no longer luxuries; they are table stakes. Add in sustainability, smarter software, and a touch of wit, and BMW appears to have built an EV that feels both futuristic and familiar.

The timing could not be sharper. Government policies are tightening around emissions. Consumers are weighing EV purchases against charging infrastructure concerns. Competitors are sprinting to fill every possible niche. The iX3 lands as BMW’s declaration that it is not only in the EV race, but intends to lead it.

Why does this car matter right now?

BMW has spent years hinting at its Neue Klasse platform. Now the first real proof is here. The iX3 delivers an estimated 497 miles of range on the European test cycle. Translated for American roads, that’s a realistic 320 to 380 miles, enough for most drivers to go days without a charge. Dual motors produce 470 horsepower and 475 pound-feet of torque, launching the SUV from zero to sixty in under five seconds. It is quick enough to thrill enthusiasts yet refined enough for daily school runs.

Charging is equally compelling. A 10-to-80 percent DC fast charge takes just 21 minutes. With only 10 minutes plugged in, the iX3 can add about 217 miles of range. For those who dread wasting time at a charger, that is the difference between frustration and convenience. And unlike most rivals, the iX3 does not only take power, it gives it back. Bidirectional charging means it can power a home during an outage, support a laptop on the roadside, or keep the blender running at a campsite. This feature elevates the iX3 beyond transportation, turning it into a mobile energy source.

Inside, BMW has leaned into innovation without abandoning common sense. A 43-inch heads-up projection stretches across the windshield, serving speed, navigation, and alerts directly into the driver’s view. Below that, a 17.9-inch display is angled toward the driver. Yet unlike many competitors, BMW has not sacrificed tactile controls. Real buttons for climate, a physical volume roller, and switches that can be found by feel make the cabin usable without constant screen tapping. In an industry obsessed with minimalism, this combination feels refreshing.

How does it compare to rivals?

The iX3 enters a crowded premium EV market that includes the Tesla Model Y, Audi Q8 e-tron, and Mercedes EQE SUV. Tesla leads on software ecosystem and brand familiarity, but the BMW outpaces it in cabin design and material sustainability. Audi’s Q8 e-tron offers refined comfort but cannot match the iX3’s charging speed or bidirectional capability. Mercedes delivers luxury, yet its reliance on screens without physical controls can feel less intuitive.

Where BMW pulls ahead is in balance. The iX3 does not overwhelm with gimmicks. Its performance is competitive, its range practical, and its tech genuinely useful. A driver who has grown weary of learning new infotainment quirks may appreciate that BMW still values tactile interaction. Meanwhile, its projected range edges out most rivals in real-world comparisons, a point that matters more to American buyers than headline acceleration numbers.

Who is this for and who should skip it?

The iX3 is tailored for buyers who want an EV that feels like a natural upgrade rather than a radical leap. Families will appreciate the 62 cubic feet of cargo space and the 58-liter frunk, big enough for groceries or weekend bags. The 4,400-pound tow rating covers trailers, boats, or even a horse box. Daily commuters will enjoy the seamless integration of safety features: adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, and traffic light recognition. Long trips are made easier by range confidence and fast charging.

This SUV also suits environmentally conscious buyers. Nearly one-third of its materials are recycled. Seat fabrics are spun from PET plastic bottles, mats are crafted from salvaged fishing nets, and the aluminum used in construction is 80 percent reused. It is a clear statement that sustainability need not look or feel compromised.

Who should skip it? Drivers looking for the cheapest way into EV ownership will not find it here. The iX3 is a premium vehicle with premium pricing. Those who demand the absolute longest range in the industry may still gravitate toward Tesla’s upper-end models. And buyers uninterested in technology might find the dual-screen cabin excessive. For the majority, though, the iX3 strikes an enviable balance.

What is the long-term significance?

BMW calls the electronic control unit of the iX3 the “Heart of Joy.” It governs power delivery, regenerative braking, and steering inputs at speeds ten times faster than previous generations. The result is silky acceleration and braking so refined it feels almost apologetic. This is more than marketing; it is a glimpse at how BMW intends to differentiate its driving experience in the electric era.

Safety technology is equally forward-looking. The iX3 reads road signs, interprets driver behavior, and provides support without the heavy-handedness of some systems. It handles roundabouts, lane changes, and traffic signals with minimal fuss. Unlike many voice assistants, BMW’s new AI-driven system responds naturally and learns habits over time. It knows when to warm the seat or suggest a charging stop, without demanding constant prompts.

In the broader industry, the iX3 establishes Neue Klasse as BMW’s future backbone. Every upcoming model will draw from its template of high-range efficiency, rapid charging, sustainable materials, and intuitive software. For consumers, this means BMW’s EVs are no longer niche experiments but mainstream flagships.

The cultural impact should not be overlooked either. By designing an EV that balances NASA-like tech with familiar BMW touches, the company demonstrates that electric vehicles need not alienate long-time petrol drivers. Instead, they can feel aspirational and approachable at once. If competitors chase the same equilibrium, the EV transition may accelerate faster than predicted.

And if you want to take advantage of tax credits for electric vehicles, run over to the dealership right away.

Federal clean energy tax credits established or expanded under former President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have been significantly curtailed by the recently passed tax legislation, which was signed into law in July 2025. The new law accelerates the expiration dates for many credits for both individuals and businesses.

Most of these credits had been set to expire at the end of 2032 or 2034. Now, they are set to expire at the end of this year, or in the case of EVs, the end of this month.

It’s important to note that you will need to pay for and complete the projects before the end of the year.

How Much Money Is at Stake?

These federal home energy tax credits have been instrumental in helping Americans lower their energy bills—and go green in the process.

One environmental group says that by taking advantage of these credits, the average household could cut their annual energy bills by over 70%, which for the average home is about $2,200 a year.

Most of the home improvement projects offer a 30 percent tax credit for the costs of qualifying clean energy systems. Most of these energy-efficient home projects are capped at $1,200; in some cases, the cap is $2,000.

Even after the federal credits expire, a number of state and local rebates will keep some incentive programs in place.

What’s Covered?

The tax credit covers a wide range of home improvement projects, everything from new water heaters to solar panels.

The credits also cover:

Energy-efficient doors, windows, and skylights

Furnaces, boilers, and central air conditioners

Electrical panel upgrades

Geothermal heat pumps, small wind turbines, fuel cells, and battery storage technology

For the most part, these projects must be done on your primary residence, which must be located in the United States. There are some exceptions for projects involving second homes and rentals.

Clean Vehicle Credits

The credit for new electric vehicles can be as high as $7,500, but under the new rules, you must take possession of the vehicle by September 30th.

There are a number of restrictions on which vehicles qualify.

They must undergo final assembly in the U.S., and there are restrictions on where the battery components and minerals come from.

The manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) cannot exceed $80,000 for pickup trucks, SUVs, and vans, or $55,000 on all other vehicles.

Your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) cannot exceed $300,000 for married couples filing jointly, $225,000 for heads of household, or $150,000 for all other filers.

The credit for used EVs is 30 percent of the sale price, up to $4,000.

For the full list of eligible vehicles, check the government website at fueleconomy.gov.

There is also a credit of 30 percent for the installation of a charging station costing up to $1,000.

The credit is applicable to both the purchase and lease of a qualifying electric vehicle. Technically, the credit belongs to the leasing company, but many will pass the credit on to the lessee. Additionally, the MAGI limitation does not apply to a leased vehicle, making this an attractive alternative to purchasing the car for those who would not qualify for the credit based on their MAGI being too high in the year they purchase the car. If you are going to lease the car, make sure the leasing company passes the credit on in the form of a rebate or reduced lease price.

How to Claim the Tax Credit

If you complete and pay for the project by the end-of-year deadline, you will need to file Form 5695, Residential Energy Credits Part II, with your 2025 tax return, which you will file in 2026.

For EVs, Consumer Reports says that most auto dealerships will apply the tax credit when you make the purchase. If not, you will need to file IRS Form 8936.

For many people, the desire to reduce their carbon footprint is reason enough to purchase an EV or make energy-efficient home improvements. However, if you also want to claim a tax credit, you don’t have any time to waste.

Despite some regional variations, U.S. electricity bills are shooting up right across the board.
U.S. power plants are depreciating faster than anticipated, and analysts now estimate it'd cost up to $5 trillion to replace the entire grid.
Earlier this week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told reporters that tackling soaring electricity prices was his top concern.
Just remember that it’ll take years before the effects of this capacity increase start to shave down your energy bills.","Let’s not beat around the bush here: We’re stuck in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.

Everything is getting more expensive. And even though we’ve managed to keep inflation at or below 3% for quite a while now, one household cost that’s starting to get out of control is electricity.

The average residential electricity bill has surged by around 10% since January, easily outpacing inflation and causing serious worries for stretched billpayers. Almost three out of four Americans say they’re stressed about further price hikes on the horizon, and over half of billpayers don’t understand what’s driving prices.

So, what's pushing electricity prices up so high in 2025? And more importantly, when are power bills going to come back down? Let’s dive a bit deeper.

Why Are Electricity Bills So High?

Despite some regional variations, U.S. electricity bills are shooting up right across the board. Regulators have already approved a colossal $29 billion in rate hikes so far in 2025, and utility companies are still asking for more.

So, why do all of these electricity providers keep increasing rates? As you might expect, a lot of it centers on supply and demand.

America’s Power Grid Needs a Facelift

The biggest issue affecting your energy bills is infrastructure. America’s electrical grid is decades old in a lot of places, and it’s in desperate need of some upgrades to maintain adequate supply.

Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency across many parts of the country and putting a lot of stress on transmission systems. U.S. power plants are depreciating faster than anticipated, and analysts now estimate it'd cost up to $5 trillion to replace the entire grid.

Fortunately, there's some political will to get this done (sort of).

Last year, President Joe Biden’s administration pledged to kickstart $2.2 billion worth of improvements across 18 states, adding nearly 13 GW of capacity. The Department of Energy (DoE) has maintained this trajectory under President Donald Trump. It’s offering billions in grants and subsidies for utility providers keen to take on modernization efforts, and some upgrades have already started.

Better infrastructure should make transmission cheaper in the future. But for now, these upgrades are going to make your bills more expensive.

Although the DoE has agreed to help out a little bit, power companies are still spending billions trying to upgrade regional systems piece by piece. To keep shareholders from jumping ship, they're passing the cost of upgrades directly onto monthly rate payers.

Worst of all, these projects have multi-year pipelines and costs tend to spiral. Permitting delays, equipment shortages, and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have slowed upgrade efforts in many parts of the country.

That means these expansion efforts aren’t going to come to fruition anytime soon. Instead, they’ll just continue to inflate your electricity bills.

Demand Has Ballooned

There are some amazing tech innovations disrupting daily life. Huge data centers, AI, and a steady rise in electric vehicle uptake have pushed demand for electricity higher than ever.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) issued a new consumption forecast warning it expects a 1.7% annual rise in demand over the next two years.

That doesn’t look like a huge rise at first glance. But zoom in for some extra context, and you’ll see that U.S. electricity consumption only increased by around 0.1% between 2005 and 2020. So that 1.7% rise is actually a dramatic shift.

Average temperatures have continued to climb, which will push up demand for cooling systems and heat pumps. A lot of these systems guzzle electricity, which will create further supply imbalances.

What Is the Trump Admin Saying About Power Bills?

Earlier this week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told reporters that tackling soaring electricity prices was his top concern. So, what is the Trump administration actually doing to bring prices down?

Aside from the usual political blame game, there’s been a huge pivot in recent months away from clean energy.

The DoE has canceled offshore wind funding and pulled billions in green energy grants. The administration has also rewritten tax credits and torn apart energy-efficiency standards like ENERGY STAR.

Instead, it’s promoting a return to “big beautiful coal” and natural gas (NGV25) to fuel American power plants.

Over 4.3 GW of natural gas generation projects have now been started or are in pre-construction. That’s more than twice the amount of natural gas generation projects that were built last year — and developers are planning to bring four new power plants online to add a total of 18.7 GW by 2028.

These capacity increases should have the desired effect (eventually).

These projects will likely create a positive tailwind for billpayers when they come to fruition. Just remember that it’ll take years before the effects of this capacity increase start to shave down your energy bills. So in the meantime, billpayers don’t have a whole lot to look forward to.

When Will Power Bills Come Back Down?

This isn’t an answer families are going to want to hear. But no one’s expecting energy bills to come down in the short term — and by short term, we’re not talking about the next few months. We’re talking about the next three years.

Analysts are forecasting investments in America’s national grid to balloon energy bills right into 2030. These big infrastructure projects take a long time. Network upgrade costs will keep trickling down to rate payers until utility companies start to realize a profit on those investments.

And while production capacity is set to increase significantly over the next three years, the U.S. is simultaneously consolidating its reliance on natural gas as its primary source of electricity generation. There’s an inherent risk there, and it'll probably hurt prices in the short term.

The Trump administration and the DoE are keen to increase domestic production of natural gas throughout Trump’s second term, and this could push prices down a bit. But there are also geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors at play that'll likely drive prices right back up.

Based on everything that’s happened over the last five years, nobody expects a glorious return to the era of cheap gas anytime this decade.

Of course, there’s a bit of a ZIP code lottery here, too. Some energy customers might see regional variations in prices thanks to local energy mixes or regulatory changes. If you're lucky, that could work in your favor.

But generally speaking, most of us just need to adapt. Energy bills are going to keep outpacing inflation. All signs indicate this is going to be the new normal for the next three to five years. So, your best bet at reducing your bills is to focus on improving your own individual energy efficiency.",,N,,2025-09-06 08:00:01.639716

If they prevail, they’ll drive up our energy costs, harm our health, and throttle our opportunities for local economic development.

The Trump administration has our clean energy economy in its crosshairs. Federal agencies are on a mission to find new bureaucratic means of stopping clean energy projects that are already financed and under construction or fully permitted. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has been meeting with political leaders in the northeast to demand that they concede to new gas pipelines thatdo not have financial support and are unlikely to reduce energy costs

If the administration and the fossil fuel industry get their way, New England families and businesses could be stuck with expensive bills to pay for gas infrastructure and price-volatile gas for years after Zeldin and President Trump are long gone.

In Connecticut, Governor Lamont doesn’t seem to grasp that investing in new gas pipelines would be costly and shortsighted. While Lamont supports the state’s climate goals, he has cravenly agreed with Trump’s demand to expand gas pipelines in the region. Lamont claims he’s responding to high electricity rates, but new gas pipelines are not the answer. In fact, investors have been unwilling to finance new pipelines in the region because they’re not a viable investment and there are no buyers for long-term gas contracts.

What Zeldin and Lamont seem to forget is that New England has been here before. In 2016, the region rejected a similar push for new gas pipelines. When the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that it was not legal to charge electric customers for the high cost of a pipeline and the Maine utility regulator determined that the plan was not cost-effective, those plans fell like a house of cards.

What Lamont is really doing is bowing to pressure from Trump and the fossil fuel industry at the expense of the people he represents. Industry front groups with deceptive names like Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future and Consumers Energy Alliance are mobilizing in support of fossil fuels and attacking clean energy. They release pro-fossil fuel studies and surveys of questionable accuracy while receiving funding from fossil fuel companies, or in the case of Mass Fiscal Alliance, refusing to say who funds them.

Despite the fossil fuel industry’s attempts to strangle clean energy, deployment has exploded across the U.S. and globally. Nationally, solar, wind, and batteries dominate as we race to add new sources of electricity to meet growing demand. Solar is the cheapest and fastest growing source of energy in the U.S. and globally

But the transition to clean energy in the U.S. is not happening fast enough to reduce our reliance on volatile fossil fuels. The Trump administration is making things worse by taking unprecedented – and often illegal – actions to slow the transition and continue inflating the profits of fossil fuel companies, which already enjoy huge government subsidies.

The Trump administration’s support for fossil fuels is purely ideological and unbelievably myopic. Nationally, 90 percent of new capacity added to the grid is from solar and wind. In the winter, wind power – a free and local resource – ramps up just when we need it most. In summer, abundant sunshine makes solar an excellent source of power. During the heat wave that hit the region this summer, rooftop solar and batteries saved us from losing power – and saved consumers almost $20 million in fuel costs.

When the federal government does the bidding of multibillion dollar corporations while driving up costs for the average American, we need states to step up. Our state and local leaders have a responsibility to lead where this administration has failed us: by investing in clean, local, and affordable sources of energy, enabling families and businesses to access clean technologies that are more efficient and better for our health, and refuting Trump’s nonsensical claims that fossil fuels are the future.

According to America’s Clean Power, a renewable energy industry group, the offshore wind sector supports 25,000 jobs in the United States.
On Friday, Mr. Wright said that European nations powered by offshore wind turbines had high electricity prices.
Eric Hines, who directs the offshore wind energy graduate program at Tufts University, acknowledged that offshore wind projects currently required substantial subsidies to be successful.
Mr. Wright blamed what he described as a misplaced emphasis in the Biden administration on tackling climate change and promoting clean energy.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday defended the Trump administration’s decision to block a nearly completed $6.2 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island by saying offshore wind increases electricity prices and by downplaying the jobs at stake.

Energy experts accused Mr. Wright of oversimplifying the economics of offshore wind energy, noting that while it requires a significant amount of upfront capital to build a project, it was expected to create more than 55,000 jobs by the end of the decade and enough electricity to inexpensively power 22 million homes before the Trump administration took steps to throttle the nascent industry.

A former fracking executive, Mr. Wright said the focus in the United States to transition away from fossil fuels had hurt the country. It’s a message he said he intended to take on a multileg trip next week to Europe, where he will encourage countries to buy more American gas. The United States is currently the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas as well as the largest producer of oil.

“Europe is in the midst of almost completely deindustrializing the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution,” Mr. Wright said, referring to Europe’s commitments to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet. He delivered those remarks on Friday to the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington research organization.

He called the 2015 Paris agreement, in which the United States and nearly every other country pledged to reduce greenhouse gases, “silly.”

“Climate change, for impacting the quality of your life, is not incredibly important,” Mr. Wright said. “In fact, if it wasn’t in the news, in the media, you wouldn’t know.”

Hundreds of the world’s top scientists gathered by the United Nations have found that greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and gas are heating the planet and already having profound effects on communities by increasing the frequency and intensity of heat waves, wildfires, drought, floods and other extreme weather.

Earlier this year Mr. Wright handpicked a group of people who reject the scientific consensus on climate change to write a report downplaying global warming. On Friday he argued that renewable energy projects developed with the aim of reducing fossil fuels were not beneficial to the United States.

He likened the Trump administration’s decision to throttle the offshore wind industry to the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would have transported carbon-heavy oil from the Canadian oil sands to the Gulf Coast. Keystone was blocked by the Obama administration and later the Biden administration because of climate change concerns.

“The difference is, in that example, that’s a huge amount of oil that would be jobs for America,” Mr. Wright said.

According to America’s Clean Power, a renewable energy industry group, the offshore wind sector supports 25,000 jobs in the United States.

On Friday, Mr. Wright said that European nations powered by offshore wind turbines had high electricity prices. “We don’t want to be in the race for the most expensive electricity in the world,” he said. “We want to be in the race for the most affordable electricity in the world.”

Jesse Jenkins, an associate professor of energy at Princeton University, called Mr. Wright’s arguments facile.

“He’s doing the classic correlation equals causality,” Mr. Jenkins said. “The reasons these places have turned so heavily to renewables is that they lack access to cheap fossil fuels and they don’t want to have to rely entirely on imported resources.”

Mr. Jenkins said that Mr. Wright’s assertion that wind and solar had led to higher electricity prices in the United States was false. “There’s no evidence for that,” he said, adding that in many parts of the country, the opposite was true, with renewables lowering the cost of electricity.

Revolution Wind was expected to generate electricity for more than 350,000 homes at 9.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, a rate that would be locked in for 20 years and is cheaper than the average cost of electricity in New England, according to America’s Clean Power.

Eric Hines, who directs the offshore wind energy graduate program at Tufts University, acknowledged that offshore wind projects currently required substantial subsidies to be successful. But he argued that states had determined that offshore wind would bring significant benefits.

“There’s an opportunity for an enormous number of jobs that are sustainable, and an opportunity to build this infrastructure that can last for generations, at which point electricity will be far less expensive than anybody can imagine,” Mr. Hines said, referring to wind power.

Mr. Wright said the abrupt stop-work order for the Revolution Wind project in Rhode Island was issued because the Biden administration acted hastily when it issued its permits, something the company leading the project and state leaders said was untrue.

Orsted, the Danish developer of Revolution Wind, is suing the Trump administration over the work stoppage, calling it capricious and arbitrary. Separately, Connecticut and Rhode Island are also suing the administration to overturn the stop-work order.

Mr. Wright suggested, without citing evidence, that a damaged wind turbine blade from a different project, Vineyard Wind, that washed up on beaches of Nantucket last year occurred because those approvals were rushed. Mr. Wright blamed what he described as a misplaced emphasis in the Biden administration on tackling climate change and promoting clean energy.

“These were permitted rather quickly,” Mr. Wright said. “If you do something fast and quickly, because we’re in a crisis and it must happen, bad things happen.”

Vineyard Wind, in Massachusetts, applied for permits in 2017 and was approved in 2021.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm Solar energy is also boosting farm finances.
The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits.
Renewable energy also powers rural economies Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.
On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.","Drive through the plains of Iowa or Kansas and you’ll see more than rows of corn, wheat and soybeans. You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.

But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.

Wind power brings steady income for farms

Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricity came from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around US$3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.

Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.

Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.

In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing between 38% and 69% of tax revenue.

The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm

Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.

Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics – dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.

Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.

However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.

Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.

What’s being lost

The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.

The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.

While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies

Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.

Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.

In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing – such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries – and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.

On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.

As rural America faces economic uncertainty and climate pressures, I believe homegrown renewable energy offers a practical path forward. Wind and solar aren’t just fueling the grid; they’re helping keep farms and rural towns alive.

Jen Kiggans, R-Va., highlighting provisions she says will deliver major benefits to Hampton Roads.

The Fiscal Year 2026 measure, passed on a 214–213 vote, funds the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Energy and water resource projects nationwide.

Republicans described the bill as strengthening U.S. energy dominance and military readiness. The legislation eliminates the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Justice and Equity and the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, and cuts more than $1.6 billion from renewable energy accounts compared with last year.

The Senate must still act before the legislation becomes law.

Kiggans secured $5.4 million in community project funding for the Norfolk Harbor Operations and Maintenance project. That money will support annual dredging of the harbor and Elizabeth River, along with dike work at Craney Island to ensure safe navigation for commercial shipping, military vessels and fishing boats. She said the funding will help protect coastal communities from flooding and storm damage while keeping Navy ships mission-ready.

“Coastal Virginia is the backbone of America’s naval power, and keeping our harbors safe and our shoreline strong is critical to both our national defense and our local economy,” Kiggans said in a statement.

The bill also directs new Department of Energy funding to Jefferson Lab in Newport News, one of the nation’s top nuclear physics research facilities.

Projects there include construction of a high performance data facility and expansion of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility. Kiggans said those investments will cement Hampton Roads’ role as a hub for scientific and technological innovation.

Nationally, the legislation sets aside $20.6 billion for nuclear weapons modernization, $2.17 billion for naval reactors including the Columbia-class submarine program, and nearly $2 billion for nuclear nonproliferation. It provides $9.8 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers, including almost $2 billion for flood and storm damage reduction projects across the country.

The measure boosts funding for advanced nuclear reactors and critical minerals research while reducing spending on renewable energy accounts.

It would also eliminate the Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and block federal support for diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

Electric-vehicle tax credits of $7,500 are now set to end Sept. 30 rather than extending through 2032, as originally planned.

In the alternative, noncomplying car companies were able to purchase credits from EV-only makers such as Tesla and Rivian to bring their vehicle lineups in line with CAFE standards.

Tesla had received $2.8 billion globally under such programs, per Reuters, while Rivian said in a court filing that the change in policy could cost the company $100 million, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Until then, the fight over how to balance resilience with affordability is set to dominate conversations from the Jersey Shore to riverfront towns.","New Jersey flood-zone rules spark storm of opposition from shore to river towns

Trenton, N.J. – Governor Phil Murphy has just a few months left in office, but he has a new idea for the Jersey Shore, and the Jersey Shore doesn’t like it any more than the governor’s failed windmill and school funding agendas.

This time, it A sweeping climate resilience plan from New Jersey regulators has triggered a surge of backlash across shore communities and inland towns alike, as residents and local leaders warn the proposed rules could drive up costs, stall development, and undercut already strained housing markets.

This means more homes will need to be raised to qualify for federal flood insurance and more restrictions will be placed on waterfront communities, many of which they cannot afford.

It’s not just Phil Murphy calling for a change. Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat nominee for governor this year is also on board with the sweeping proposed regulations.

“Here in New Jersey’s 11th District, we have been living with the impact of increased inland and coastal flooding due to climate change,” said Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), Chairwoman of the Congressional Subcommittee on Environment. “Today’s report – based on robust scientific evidence from NOAA – tells us that that flooding from tidal and storm surges in the next 30 years will travel further inland and occur 10 times more often than it does today. We must redouble our efforts both to reduce climate warming pollution and to equip our communities with tools and resources to protect their residents from the worst effects of climate change.”

The regulations, known as the REAL rules—short for Resilient Environments and Landscapes—are part of the state’s Protecting Against Climate Threats (PACT) initiative. They would modernize land-use laws to account for projected sea-level rise and recurrent flooding, reshaping how development is planned from the coast to inland rivers.

At the center of the proposal is a new “Inundation Risk Zone,” covering areas projected to flood by 2100. In those zones, new construction and significant redevelopment would need to be elevated at least four feet above FEMA’s base flood standard, down from the original five-foot requirement after community pushback.

The rules would also expand flood hazard boundaries across the state and impose stricter stormwater and infrastructure mandates.

Business groups, municipalities, and homeowners argue the proposal could impose staggering costs without a clear economic analysis. Critics point to the state’s reliance on a severe sea-level scenario with only a 17% probability, which they say unfairly classifies vast areas as high risk.

Others warn of “dry access” requirements that could force property owners to elevate roads and infrastructure outside their control—effectively creating no-build zones.

“climate change poses an unprecedented threat to our transportation infrastructure. Sea level rise and coastal flooding place 60,000 miles of roads and bridges in coastal floodplains at greater risk. Rail infrastructure is vulnerable to more frequent extreme heat waves. Increased precipitation and inland flooding threaten the structural integrity of thousands of bridges. Airports are exposed to a spectrum of flooding and extreme heat risks. And the impacts of climate change for transportation infrastructure will only intensify over time,” Sherrill said.

The impact on housing and insurance looms large. Opponents fear the rules could depress property values, inflate flood insurance premiums, and stifle affordable housing development at a time when demand is already acute.

Supporters counter that the rules are grounded in science, citing Rutgers University research projecting up to five feet of sea-level rise by century’s end under moderate emissions scenarios. They argue that elevated standards are essential to safeguard communities against worsening storms and coastal flooding.

Don’t worry, adjustments and exemptions for affordable housing have already been built into the plan.

The Department of Environmental Protection has delayed final adoption, extending a 60-day comment period and additional hearings, with a final decision expected in early 2026. Until then, the fight over how to balance resilience with affordability is set to dominate conversations from the Jersey Shore to riverfront towns.

Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat running for governor has also issued a warning while serving in Congress about preparing New Jersey for her climate agenda and fears of rising sea levels.

“We’re no strangers to flooding in the Garden State. Storm after storm, New Jersey families and businesses have to face the devastating impact of major flood events. That’s why, since first taking office, I have been focused on working with the community to come up with both short and long-term solutions to build climate-resilient infrastructure that will protect our state from flooding. Each of the projects we fought for in this year’s WRDA will advance efforts to keep families safe from flooding and make long-overdue infrastructure upgrades,” said Rep.

Although a 50% price cut always seemed unrealistic, the president’s message sent a clear signal that lower energy costs were one of his top priorities. But in one key energy sector his administration is not showing much evidence that it is having any impact. US electricity prices, which began to rise steadily during the Biden administration, have continued to increase under President Trump.

Over the 12 years from the start of 2009 to the end of 2020, average US retail power prices, as measured by the electricity component in the CPI, rose by 12%. Over the four and a half years since the start of 2021, they have risen by 36%. The average annual rate of electricity price inflation has jumped from 1% to 7%.

Public concern over electricity bills is growing. A poll in April commissioned by the non-profit group PowerLines found that 63% of respondents said their electric and gas utility bills were adding to their financial stress. Social media are full of angry comments from consumers shocked by their rising bills.

Politicians have taken notice. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic candidate for the governorship of New Jersey, has said that on her first day in office she would declare an emergency over utility costs.

Mike Braun, the Republican governor of Indiana, this week created a new role for a Utility Consumer Counselor, with a mission to save money for ratepayers. Governor Braun said: ""We can't take it anymore… [I would] like to see the utilities' investors bear more of the cost of doing business.""

Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut, a Democrat, said in June: “I think electric bills are too damn high”, and signed legislation intended to cut them.

The American public has had a range of opinions on who bears the most responsibility for rising bills. A poll in New Jersey last month found that utility companies were the most widely blamed, chosen by 26% of respondents, followed by the state’s governor (19%), the federal government (15%), the state legislature (14%) and energy producers (10%).

Energy secretary Chris Wright said this week on Fox News that stopping the rise in electricity prices and reshoring jobs and opportunity was what he worried about most, seven days a week. And he argued that changing the direction of the industry would take time.

“Electricity prices rose a lot – almost 30% – under the Biden administration, and it angered Americans. It’s part of the reason President Trump was elected,” he said. “That is a key challenge for us, though: things move slowly in the electricity grid. All sorts of crazy projects were under construction and being built on your electricity grids over the last four years. We can’t stop all of them. They’re going to get finished. That extra expenditure goes into the rate base for the utility, and it pushes up your prices.”

Over the next few years, he added, he expected the administration to “make enormous progress” in stopping the rise in electricity prices, while making sure there was sufficient power available for the US to remain ahead of China in developing AI.

But progress over the next few years may not assuage mounting discontent among the American public.

The Wood Mackenzie view

The bad news for politicians and industry leaders who are being blamed for rising electricity bills is that the upward pressure on prices is set to continue. In fact, some of the drivers expected to push prices higher over the coming decades are only just starting to take effect.

Over the past five years, electricity bills have been rising in part because of the need to replace ageing infrastructure and strengthen resilience to events such as wildfires and storms.

Over the past four years, investment by US investor-owned electric utilities has risen by about 50%, from US$134 billion in 2021 to US$203 billion in 2025, according to the Edison Electric Institute, the industry group. That capital spending goes into the utilities’ rate bases, allowing them to recover their costs through higher bills.

Robert Whaley, Wood Mackenzie’s director for North America power, says there are two other key factors that will put upward pressure on US retail electricity prices over the years and decades to come.

One is demand growth, driven in particular by data centres for AI, but also by new manufacturing facilities and the electrification of transport in some states.

There are many uncertainties here, including how much of the proposed new demand will actually materialise, and how far rate structures are adopted to shield residential customers from some of the impact. But as a general principle, if higher demand means increased investment in new generation, distribution and transmission infrastructure, that investment will have to be paid for somehow.

The other factor is higher natural gas prices, driven by increased consumption for power generation and higher LNG exports. US benchmark Henry Hub gas has generally remained subdued in recent years, with prices falling back after a spike in 2022. But over time we think US gas prices will be on a rising trend.

Wood Mackenzie is forecasting that Henry Hub will average about US$4.60 per million British thermal units (mmBTU) in real terms in 2030, up from about US$3 / mmBTU today.

Because gas plants are generally the marginal suppliers, that will put wholesale power prices in most markets on a rising trend.

All this suggests that without some dramatic policy interventions, the consumers who are unhappy about their electricity bills are going to get even less happy in the years to come. The prospect of more such interventions is becoming a material issue for the industry.

In brief

President Trump has filed a formal request to the US Supreme Court for it to decide rapidly on the legality of the wide-ranging tariffs he has announced since taking office in January. Two lower courts have ruled that the president exceeded his legal powers when imposing two sets of tariffs: the “fentanyl tariffs” on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, and the “reciprocal tariffs” imposed on almost all countries.

Article I of the US Constitution specifies that it is Congress that has the power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises… [and to] regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.” The Trump administration argues that the president is allowed to set tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives him the authority to take action “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to the national security or economy of the US. John Sauer, the Trump administration’s solicitor-general, recommended that the Supreme Court should hear oral arguments in the case in the first week of November.

Two Japanese engineering companies have talked about confirmed or possible investments in power equipment manufacturing that should help ease tightness in the supply chain and allow a faster build-out of new infrastructure. Hitachi announced planned investments of more than US$1 billion in the US, including US$457 million for a new large power transformer factory in Virginia.

Separately, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was reported to be prepared to double its production capacity for gas turbines. Chief executive Eisaku Ito said the company was already increasing capacity by 30%, but that would not be enough to meet growing demand.

The insurance marketplace Lloyd’s of London has said it will no longer seek to discourage insurers from providing coverage for coal, oil sands and Arctic oil projects. New chief executive Patrick Tiernan, who took over in June, told the Financial Times: “It’s important we don’t wade into issues we don’t need to.” Under his predecessor, John Neal, Lloyd’s had said in 2022 that it would ask insurers at the marketplace to no longer provide new insurance coverage for or invest in coal-fired power plants, thermal coal mines, oil sands projects and Arctic oil development. That position has now been dropped

Tiernan said in a statement discussing the financial performance of the Lloyd’s market in the first half of 2025: “We must remain apolitical. Our neutrality is part of our value. In a world of strained trade relations, Lloyd’s licence network can be a safe harbour.”

Quote of the week

“Even if you wrapped the entire planet in a solar panel, you would only be producing 20% of global energy. One of the biggest mistakes politicians can make is equating the ELECTRICITY with ENERGY!”

Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, posted on X in support of his argument that the Biden administration put too much emphasis on “unreliable, intermittent electricity” from wind and solar.

His point was that electricity accounts for only about 20% of the world’s final energy consumption. So even if all of that power was provided by solar, there would still be enormous demand for oil, gas and coal. Supporters of renewable energy countered that in that impossible hypothetical scenario – or even in a possible case of massively increased solar generation – electricity’s share of global energy consumption could increase significantly, through the electrification of transport and heating. It would also be possible to use electricity to create gas and liquid fuels.

More than 10 years ago, hybrids had a reputation for being slow, low-power vehicles.

""Now automakers are tuning them for better performance as well as fuel economy,"" Barry added. ""So, sometimes the better the version of the car, the more fun to drive, is the hybrid.""

Most hybrids today are getting over 40 and 50 miles per gallon.

As the global economy responds to the climate crisis and advances in clean energy innovation, our region is strategically positioned to compete on a global scale—if stakeholders align shared values, goals, and investments.

At Sustainable Pittsburgh, we believe this transformation begins with our key partners. Since 2021, the Clean Energy Workforce Roundtable has brought together hundreds of employers, educators, community-based organizations, labor leaders, and government partners to create an inclusive, coordinated clean energy workforce ecosystem across the 10-county region.

This work is part of our broader mission to position Southwestern Pennsylvania—Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, and beyond—as a national and global model for sustainable, equitable economic growth.

Why Pittsburgh and Why Now?

Findings from the Clean Energy Workforce Roundtable demonstrate that our region is positioned for a stronger, more resilient future. The 2024 report, Clean Energy Workforce Needs and Opportunities for Southwestern Pennsylvania, identifies priority sectors such as energy efficiency, electrification, construction, and advanced manufacturing that are poised for rapid growth with sustained regional support.

More importantly, these sectors represent accessible career paths for workers with a range of educational and professional backgrounds. However, opportunity alone is not enough. If we are going to lead in clean energy, we must act deliberately and collaboratively. Among the Roundtable’s top recommendations:

Build sector-based training partnerships among employers, education providers, workforce boards, and unions.

Embed equity and inclusion into every stage of the workforce pipeline.

Develop blended funding models across public, private, and philanthropic sectors to scale training, apprenticeships, and job placement efforts.

Support wraparound services like childcare, transit, and mentorship to remove persistent barriers to workforce entry.

These recommendations directly align with the insights of local stakeholders and broader regional research on clean energy development, including recent work by RMI.

Finding Regional Alignment

The Heinz Foundation, in conjunction with research firm RMI, has gathered data and released findings that support the need for regional alignment towards building a strong clean energy workforce ecosystem (detailed here: Developing Cleantech Clusters in Southwestern Pennsylvania).

The RMI report underscores the need for stronger regional coordination and shared infrastructure to support a thriving clean energy economy. Among its key recommendations is the establishment of a short-term, regional effort to explore how a cleantech cluster initiative could take shape, including identifying core functions, testing models, and eventually determining a permanent home for the effort.Five priority functions are identified for a cleantech cluster initiative:

Align stakeholders on a regional cleantech plan

Connect regional stakeholders across sectors

Conduct analysis to support location branding and competitive positioning

Coordinate the lab-to-market ecosystem to improve innovation flow

Augment business attraction, retention, and expansion efforts

These functions would require the collaborative involvement of diverse stakeholders including economic development organizations, universities, workforce developers, businesses, startup incubators, planning bodies, and community-based organizations to succeed.

These helpful insights reflect the very challenges Sustainable Pittsburgh’s Clean Energy Workforce Roundtable has been working to address since its inception. The Roundtable brings together essential partners focused on advancing solutions, and serves as a platform for collaboration that helps break down silos, share best practices, and elevate strategies that are inclusive, actionable, and grounded in the lived experiences of workers and communities.

The Road Ahead: Vision Meets Opportunity

The RMI report identifies three priority sectors where the region has a comparative advantage:

Battery Manufacturing and Recycling

Solar Component Manufacturing

Green Buildings and Related Technologies

These findings reinforce existing efforts of Sustainable Pittsburgh’s Clean Energy Workforce Roundtable, which has focused on building pathways into precisely these areas through regional coordination, workforce equity, and strategic visibility.

An integral project of the Roundtable’s work, the Future Energy Career Maps platform, was built to address the barriers identified in the RMI report: limited awareness of opportunities, fragmented training pathways, and unclear routes into emerging careers. The Career Maps (which currently highlight the construction and advanced manufacturing sectors) provide a clear, interactive pathway for job seekers to explore and pursue future potential in clean energy careers. The platform showcases real, achievable roles, local training providers, job requirements, expected salaries, and advancement opportunities.

The Future Energy Career Maps directly align with the talent pipelines needed in the three identified cleantech sectors:

Battery Manufacturing and Recycling We have identified training and career pathways in CNC machining and machinery maintenance which directly support the technical skillsets needed in advanced battery production and equipment operation. The maps highlight clear on-ramps into these jobs without requiring a four-year degree.

Solar Component Manufacturing The manufacturing map features roles such as (metal) fabricator and (electronics) assembler, all of which feed directly into solar component supply chains.

Green Buildings and Related Technologies

The construction map showcases a range of energy-smart careers like building analyst, building/home performance crew leader, solar installer, HVAC technician, and weatherization technician. These roles are critical for both new green construction and retrofitting existing infrastructure—two major drivers of job creation in the region’s building sector.

By demystifying career pathways, highlighting accessible training, and focusing on local relevance, the Career Maps themselves serve as a regional coordination tool by connecting job seekers, educators, and employers around a shared clean energy vision.

The RMI report validates the strategies the Roundtable has championed: breaking down silos, creating tools for workforce alignment, and prioritizing sectors where our region can lead. But it also makes clear that this work must scale—and that it will take intentional, coordinated action across the ecosystem to ensure the full potential of these opportunities is realized.

Sustainable Pittsburgh is committed to advancing that alignment and continuing to build the connectivity needed to support a thriving, equitable clean energy workforce in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

A Path Forward Together

As our region continues to evolve, the opportunity to grow a clean energy workforce that reflects our shared values has never been more clear. Southwestern Pennsylvania is rich with potential, from its history, industry, and innovation, to its people, partnerships, and purpose.

Sustainable Pittsburgh’s Clean Energy Workforce Roundtable is one of many efforts helping to shape this transition by bringing together diverse voices across sectors and geographies. We are dedicated to building a future where more residents see themselves in the clean energy economy and feel supported in the journey to get there.

We believe in a region that thrives economically, advances environmental sustainability, and ensures that opportunity reaches every community.

This shared vision was recently echoed in a joint op-ed by Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato and Heinz Endowments President Chris DeCardy. In their message, they affirm the importance of building a clean-technology future grounded in collaboration, equity and economic renewal. Their call to action reinforces the momentum we’re seeing across the region and strengthens our collective resolve to work together toward a stronger, more environmentally and economically sustainable region (read the full op-ed here).

Looking ahead, we’ll continue listening, learning, and collaborating—helping to create a clean energy workforce ecosystem that:

Reflects the unique needs and aspirations of our communities

Connects jobseekers to meaningful, family-sustaining careers

Builds a foundation for long-term investment and regional growth

Southwestern Pennsylvania has what it takes to forge a better future, for all.Let’s keep building the bridges that carry us there.

Direct air capture isn’t just a carbon management solution, it’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalize U.S. industry, restore communities, and secure America’s position in global energy markets. As DAC technology scales, it has the potential to create 130,000 American jobs in the coming decades — and reinvigorate regions hit hardest by the decline of manufacturing and industrial activity.

But the opportunity goes beyond jobs: DAC offers a rare chance to rebuild domestic supply chains, drive innovation and prosperity, and strengthen our national competitiveness in energy and infrastructure.

Manufacturing’s second act with DAC

U.S. supply chain realities are hitting multinational manufacturers hard. In the 1950s, manufacturing jobs represented 35% of U.S. employment; today, the share has dropped to just 9.4%. From solar panels to semiconductors, production capacity of critical components has increasingly moved overseas, jeopardizing U.S. economic security.

Meanwhile, global competitors like Canada, China, and the European Union are racing ahead with carbon removal technologies, bolstered by investment and policy support, putting them in a position to gain a first-mover advantage where American innovation can lead the way. Thanks to the preservation of the carbon capture and sequestration tax credit, or 45Q, in this year’s GOP budget legislation, the U.S. has taken an important step toward building a strong domestic DAC industry. Yet, without continued federal support to prioritize domestic manufacturing and deployment, we risk repeating a familiar story: developing transformative technology on U.S. soil, and scaling it abroad.

DAC presents a rare opportunity to break that cycle. It requires a complex supply chain — from steel and sensors to sorbents and automation — many of which can be produced by retooling or integrating into existing manufacturing processes. As automotive plants close around North America, many could be retooled to produce DAC systems, reviving local economies and extending the life of existing industrial assets. The technology can also be combined with existing ventilation systems in buildings, leveraging current infrastructure for low-cost carbon management, or else it can utilize waste heat to power the DAC regeneration process, improving overall energy efficiency.

One emerging use case is the data centers fueling the AI boom. Recent New York Times reporting showed that data centers are expected to double electricity use by 2030, intensifying pressure on regional grids and water supplies. As utilities scramble to keep up, some DAC systems offer a multi-faceted solution: They can integrate with data centers to recycle waste heat, reduce emissions, and even generate clean water.

With growing concern about data centers consuming entire towns’ worth of electricity and water, co-locating with DAC offers a way to decarbonize this next phase of digital infrastructure.

Community transformation: From coal to DAC

Consider Moffat County, Colorado, where Craig Station coal-fired power plant and nearby mines are closing. The community faces the loss of more than 400 jobs and nearly half of its property tax revenue when those facilities close their doors.

But rather than let these workers and towns fall behind, Colorado has introduced a carbon management roadmap, identifying DAC and other carbon management technologies as pillars of its energy future. The plan has the potential to create an average of 2,480 project jobs and 1,575 ongoing operation jobs across the state over 15 years — offering a future beyond coal.

This community shares a common need with many coal hubs across the U.S.: sustainable employment alternatives, leveraging existing skills and infrastructure to revitalize their economies. This is what DAC can provide.

Research indicates that an initial 500-kiloton DAC project generates between 540 and 1,370 average annual jobs over its five-year construction period, and between 300 and 420 ongoing jobs associated with maintaining the project and related supplier activities over the facility’s lifetime. Each DAC facility needs steel workers, engineers, technicians, operators, construction crews for building, maintenance teams for operation.

Critically, many of these roles are a fit for workers from fossil fuel and traditional energy sectors, which would make retraining easier and transitions smoother. At the same time, these regions can maintain their energy identity and leadership, continuing to be essential contributors to the country’s energy strategy.

The race to lead is on

The carbon removal market is expected to grow to as much as $100 billion a year by 2035. And with this massive opportunity comes intense competition. China and the EU are moving aggressively to make carbon removal a part of their industrial strategies. In fact, the EU is currently assessing DAC and other approaches to see how they can reach their goals. Canadian leaders announced they will ensure that the full value of their own carbon capture tax credit is extended to 2035 to support a broad range of carbon removal innovation.

The nation that leads in DAC will secure advantages that extend far beyond economic benefits. It will have the chance to shape global energy markets for decades to come, and shepherd critical supply chains. The United States has the expertise, industrial capacity, and skilled workforce to dominate this emerging sector — but only if we act decisively. To unlock this opportunity, we need to see coordinated efforts between industry, government, and communities, beginning now.

The most important piece in securing American leadership is having federal policies that prioritize domestic manufacturing, create long-term procurement pathways, and support early DAC deployment in energy communities. The strengthened 45Q tax credit is a powerful foundation — a clear signal that the current administration recognizes the opportunity. Now, Congress and the White House must build on that momentum to ensure that DAC becomes a “Made in America” industry that benefits the regions that need it most.

He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high.
The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump.
Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.
The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package.","WASHINGTON — The world's richest man could become its first trillionaire if Elon Musk hits a series of extremely aggressive targets for his electric car company over the next decade, according to a proposed pay package released by the company.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world’s first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.

Musk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world's most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company's compensation committee — not least because of Tesla’s main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk's foray into right-wing politics.

“It doesn’t matter how much money he gets. He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high. “And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.”

To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world’s first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world’s most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.

Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.

Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years. He is currently estimated to be worth more than $400 billion by Forbes magazine.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German. Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla’s 0.7%.

Without a reversal of those trends, meeting the financial goals could prove especially difficult. In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Even bulls on the stock are not convinced the new pay incentive will keep Musk, who frequently posts on his X social media platform, from saying things that alienate potential buyers.

Said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, “Fixing the Musk brand damage remains a work in progress."" Even so, Ives told clients, “We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk.”

In January 2024, a Delaware judge threw out Musk’s previous pay package, worth $44.9 billion at the time. Investors voted to restore that compensation package at Tesla’s last shareholders meeting on June 13 of last year. But late last year the package was revoked for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling. Last month, Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented” growth — despite the drop in sales and profits — and noting that the CEO hadn’t been paid in years.

The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package. Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. Musk has said that he needed more shares and control so he couldn’t be ousted by shareholder activists. If he does hit all the goals, Musk would own about quarter of the company’s shares, up from 13% today.

Strategic Investment Opportunities in U.S. Energy Infrastructure The U.S. energy infrastructure sector offers compelling opportunities for investors seeking to hedge against geopolitical risks.
Investors who prioritize these sectors can capitalize on the U.S.’s ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy while mitigating exposure to volatile fossil fuel markets.
In conclusion, the Russian-China energy shift creates a strategic window for U.S. investors to bolster energy security and capitalize on emerging markets.","The global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market in 2025 is undergoing a seismic shift as Russia pivots its energy exports toward China, reshaping trade flows and challenging U.S. energy dominance. This realignment, driven by geopolitical tensions and strategic infrastructure projects like the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, presents both risks and opportunities for investors in U.S. energy infrastructure and alternative technologies.

The Russian-China Energy Partnership: A Geopolitical and Market Shift

Russian pipeline gas exports to China surged by 25% in the first half of 2025, with the Power of Siberia pipeline operating at maximum capacity [5]. Meanwhile, Russian LNG exports to China, though declining by 18.8% year-on-year to 3.38 million tons in Q3 2025 [2], remain a critical component of China’s energy mix, accounting for 21% of Russia’s LNG exports in early 2025 [6]. This shift reflects a deliberate strategy by Russia to diversify its export markets amid Western sanctions and China’s desire to secure long-term energy supplies.

The Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, finalized in September 2025, exemplifies this partnership. Expected to deliver 50 billion cubic meters of gas annually to China via Mongolia, the project underscores Russia’s pivot to Asia and China’s growing leverage in global gas markets [3]. However, the pipeline’s economic viability remains uncertain due to pricing disputes and financing challenges [4].

Implications for U.S. LNG Exports and Energy Security

While Russian gas sales to China have not directly harmed U.S. energy markets, as noted by the U.S. Energy Secretary in September 2025 [1], the long-term implications are significant. China’s increasing reliance on Russian pipeline gas—particularly through the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline, which operates near its 3.7 billion cubic feet per day capacity [4]—reduces its dependence on LNG, including U.S. exports. This shift is compounded by geopolitical tensions, such as U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, which have led to re-sales of U.S.-sourced LNG cargoes in China [6].

Yet, the U.S. LNG industry is not without momentum. New projects like the Plaquemines LNG facility and Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion have boosted U.S. peak export capacity to over 17 billion cubic feet per day in 2025 [2]. By 2030, U.S. LNG capacity is projected to grow by 75%, driven by final investment decisions on projects like Louisiana LNG Phase 1 and CP2 LNG Phase 1 [1]. This expansion positions the U.S. to capitalize on global LNG demand, particularly in Asia, where Russia’s market share may plateau due to infrastructure constraints [5].

Strategic Investment Opportunities in U.S. Energy Infrastructure

The U.S. energy infrastructure sector offers compelling opportunities for investors seeking to hedge against geopolitical risks. The Trump administration’s focus on accelerating LNG exports and removing regulatory barriers aligns with the need to counter Russian-China energy partnerships [3]. For instance, Woodside Energy’s Louisiana LNG Phase 1 and Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Midscale Trains 8 & 9 are expected to come online between 2027 and 2029, further solidifying U.S. export capacity [1].

Investors should also consider the role of Canadian LNG projects, such as LNG Canada, which began operations in June 2025 [1]. These projects diversify North American supply chains and reduce reliance on Russian energy, aligning with U.S. strategic interests.

The Rise of Alternative Energy: A Counterbalance to Fossil Fuel Dynamics

While LNG remains a cornerstone of global energy security, the rapid growth of renewable energy investments in China and the U.S. is reshaping the landscape. China’s clean energy investment in 2024 exceeded $625 billion, with solar and wind capacity targets achieved six years ahead of schedule [4]. In contrast, U.S. investments in renewable energy declined by 36% in the first half of 2025 due to policy uncertainty [1].

However, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 has catalyzed $115 billion in U.S. clean energy manufacturing investments through Q1 2025 [3]. This momentum, though lagging behind China’s pace, highlights opportunities in technologies like hydrogen, carbon capture, and next-generation nuclear energy [3]. Investors who prioritize these sectors can capitalize on the U.S.’s ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy while mitigating exposure to volatile fossil fuel markets.

Geopolitical Risks and the Path Forward

The U.S. and its allies must remain vigilant against Russian sanctions evasion and the EU’s phasedown of Russian gas imports [1]. Meanwhile, China’s domestic renewable energy growth—driven by solar PV, intelligent grids, and battery storage—could further reduce its LNG demand [6]. For investors, this underscores the importance of diversifying portfolios across energy infrastructure and alternative technologies.

In conclusion, the Russian-China energy shift creates a strategic window for U.S. investors to bolster energy security and capitalize on emerging markets. By leveraging U.S. LNG expansion, supporting domestic clean energy innovation, and navigating geopolitical risks, investors can position themselves at the forefront of a transformed global energy landscape.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-05 23:58:44.588722

“Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo co-founder and CEO.
“Tennessee is well positioned to lead America’s energy independence, which is why we created the Nuclear Energy Fund to support and expand our state’s nuclear ecosystem.
Oklo is developing next-generation nuclear power plants called “powerhouses” that run on nuclear waste.
Oklo argues its business model simplifies clean energy access by selling power, not power plants – offering customers a direct pathway to advanced nuclear energy.","Advanced nuclear power and fuel company Oklo announced plans to design, build and operate a fuel recycling facility in Tennessee as the first phase of an advanced fuel center through investment totaling up to $1.68 billion.

The initial investment will be for the construction of a facility to recycle used nuclear fuel into fuel for fast reactors like Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse, and the company claims it will be the first of its kind in the U.S.

Oklo is also exploring opportunities with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to recycle the utility’s used fuel at the new facility and to evaluate potential power sales from future Oklo powerhouses in the region to TVA. This collaboration would mark the first time a U.S. utility has explored recycling its used fuel into clean electricity using modern electrochemical processes, Oklo noted.

“Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo co-founder and CEO. “By recycling used fuel at scale, we are turning waste into gigawatts, reducing costs, and establishing a secure U.S. supply chain that will support the deployment of clean, reliable, and affordable power. Tennessee is showing the nation that recycling can be done to support new nuclear development and growth.”

Oklo has completed a licensing project plan for the fuel recycling facility with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is currently in pre-application engagement with the regulator’s staff. In July, Oklo successfully completed pre-application readiness assessment for Phase 1 of the combined license application for Oklo’s first commercial Aurora powerhouse. The facility in Tennessee is expected to begin producing metal fuel for Aurora powerhouses by the early 2030s, following regulatory review and approvals.

Oklo argues that the more than 94,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel stored at power plant sites around the country contain “considerable reserves” of recyclable fuel, with the energy available from this material via recycling equivalent to about 1.3 trillion barrels of oil, or five times the reserves of Saudi Arabia.

“The next generation of nuclear technologies are being built and developed right here in our own backyard,” said TVA President and CEO Don Moul. “Our partnership with Oklo represents yet another step forward in shaping the future of nuclear energy and ensuring a secure energy future for the Valley and beyond.”

The fuel recycling facility is the first phase of Oklo’s broader advanced fuel center, a multi-facility campus aimed at supporting recycling and fuel fabrication.

“Tennessee is well positioned to lead America’s energy independence, which is why we created the Nuclear Energy Fund to support and expand our state’s nuclear ecosystem. We’re proud to partner with Oklo to innovate for the future, while bringing continued opportunity and prosperity to Tennessee families,” said Governor Bill Lee.

Oklo is developing next-generation nuclear power plants called “powerhouses” that run on nuclear waste. The company’s Aurora powerhouse design is a fast neutron reactor that would transport heat from the reactor core to a power conversion system and is designed to run on material from used nuclear fuel known as HALEU, or “high assay, low-enriched uranium.” The reactor builds on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II and space reactor legacy. The Aurora powerhouse is designed to scale to 15 MW and 50 MW offerings today. Oklo is also evaluating a 100 MW or larger offering that it is developing.

Oklo argues its business model simplifies clean energy access by selling power, not power plants – offering customers a direct pathway to advanced nuclear energy. Aurora powerhouses are planned to support growing energy demands as they are deployed in the future. Oklo’s first Aurora powerhouse is targeted for deployment in 2027 at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 22:59:20.412250

This substation plays a critical role in stabilizing network voltage and enhancing the capacity to connect future renewable energy sources to the grid.

National Grid has set a bold target to reduce emissions of SF6 from its network by 50% by 2030, marking a major milestone in its drive toward sustainability. Achieving this vision required more than just replacing legacy equipment; it demanded a new generation of high-performance, eco-efficient technologies.

At the Bengeworth Road substation, the journey began with the deployment of ester-filled transformers and SF₆-free switchgear. Hitachi Energy delivered seven bays of its EconiQ™ 420 kV gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) and 420 kV gas-insulated lines (GIL), enabling long-distance electricity transmission without the use of SF₆.

But innovation didn’t stop there. National Grid sought a direct connection between the eco-efficient transformers and SF₆-free switchgear - a configuration never implemented before. This requirement called for a complete redesign of the transformer bushing, a critical component that enables the safe and reliable transfer of electricity between the transformer and switchgear.

To meet this challenge, Hitachi Energy developed a new bushing design with updated coating and gasket systems, engineered specifically for compatibility with both ester oil and the alternative insulating gas. This advancement ensured not only technical performance and safety but also compliance with strict environmental standards.

To solve this challenge, Hitachi Energy introduced a breakthrough component: GARIP Eco, a next-generation dry-type resin-impregnated paper (RIP) bushing developed specifically for SF₆-free applications. For the Bengeworth project, Hitachi Energy delivered 420 kV and 145 kV GARIP Eco bushings designed to operate reliably between ester-filled transformers and EconiQ™ SF₆-free GIS.

GARIP Eco is a next-generation solution purpose-built for tomorrow’s switchgear. Developed in response to the industry’s growing shift toward eco-efficient gas mixtures like C4-FN blends, GARIP Eco bridges the insulation and mechanical challenges posed by new dielectric conditions, elevated internal pressures, and material compatibility with ester oils.

Developed through close collaboration across transformer and switchgear engineering teams, GARIP Eco represents a complete rethinking of bushing performance, engineered from the ground up to handle the new insulation gases, materials, and pressure demands of a fully eco-efficient system.

Its dry-type design also eliminates the risks associated with oil-filled components, enhancing environmental safety and simplifying maintenance. In doing so, GARIP Eco has proven its role not only as a technical enabler but as a foundational element for future-ready substation design.

This pilot project has successfully validated the seamless interaction between the innovative GARIP Eco bushings and EconiQ™ switchgear, making them ready for deployment in future applications.

Additionally, the extensive research and expertise gained during this project provide a strong foundation for verifying compatibility with other gases upon request.

A key advantage of Hitachi Energy's bushings is also their universal platform applicability to transformers from all OEMs, offering unmatched flexibility and scalability for future projects.

The implementation of Hitachi Energy’s GARIP Eco bushings has delivered transformative benefits, ensured the compatibility of SF6-free systems while enabling a more compact and eco-efficient substation design. By eliminating the need for larger infrastructure, this solution significantly reduces material use and lowers the substation's overall carbon emissions.

The Bengeworth Road substation is set to play a vital role in providing a reliable power supply for London, supporting the integration of more renewable energy sources into the grid, and advancing the UK’s net-zero ambitions. Beyond energy innovation, National Grid’s commitment to sustainability was further demonstrated by planting 27 new trees in Ruskin Park, achieving a 10% net biodiversity gain in the substation area.

In conclusion, the collaboration between Hitachi Energy and National Grid has not only overcome the challenges of transitioning to SF6-free systems but has also set a new benchmark for sustainable energy solutions. By empowering National Grid to meet its sustainability goals, Hitachi Energy has contributed to the creation of a eco-friendly and resilient energy grid for London and beyond, setting a new benchmark for innovation and partnership in building a more resilient, low-carbon energy future.",https://dynamic-assets.hitachienergy.com/is/image/hitachiabbpowergrids/css-bengeworth-page-banner-image-2880x1125px:16-9?wid=1440&hei=810&fmt=png-alpha&fit=crop%2C1,N,,2025-09-06 06:59:46.457716
