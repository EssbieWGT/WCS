Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Arrived

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

Worthy Bonds

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

IRA Financial

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Assistant Secretary Tim Walsh welcomed U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to the Hanford Site last week.

“I was honored to show U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright the tremendous progress on full display at Hanford,” Assistant Secretary Walsh said. “I congratulate Ray Geimer and his team, our contractor partners and hardworking craftworkers for advancing our critical missions at Hanford. I look forward to building relationships across Hanford, regulators, Congress, tribes, and the community to advance cleanup solutions, unleash economic vitality and unlock potential in the Tri-Cities.”

Secretary Wright and Assistant Secretary Walsh participated in a comprehensive tour of the Direct-Feed Low-Activity (DFLAW) system that has turned over 36,000 gallons of tank waste into glass since October. Tour stops included the Waste Treatment Plant, the Tank Side Cesium Removal System and the tank farms. Secretary Wright and Assistant Secretary Walsh were also briefed on solutions to accelerate progress including opportunities for solidifying portions of Hanford tank waste into grout in parallel to ongoing DFLAW operations.

Additional briefings focused on work at the highly contaminated 324 Building that supported research on radioactive materials, the transfer of radioactive capsules from the Waste Encapsulation Facility to safer dry storage, and other remediation priorities as well as land and facilities ripe for potential beneficial reuse to support economic vitality and American energy dominance.",https://ladailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/favicon_30.ico,N,,2025-12-12 21:59:44.011796

The Leger poll, commissioned by the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association (CVMA), Global Automakers of Canada (GAC) and the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA), found that only 31 per cent of respondents support the policy, while nearly half (46 per cent) would like to see it scaled back or scrapped.

Industry leaders say the findings reflect a gap between government ambitions and consumer readiness. “Canadians want support to transition to electric vehicles, not unrealistic government mandates that can’t be met,” said Brian Kingston, CVMA president and CEO, in a statement.

The federal mandate requires ZEVs to make up 20 per cent of new light-duty vehicle sales in 2026, 60 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Plug-in hybrids, battery-electric vehicles and fuel-cell models all qualify.

The results of the poll arrive at a moment of cooling momentum for EV sales. ZEVs represented 10.2 per cent of new-vehicle sales in September, down 43.3 per cent from a year earlier.

The poll also suggests that vehicle availability at dealerships, once a prominent concern, is no longer viewed as a major barrier, with only 11 per cent citing it. Instead, Canadians continue to flag affordability, driving range and charging access as the factors limiting adoption.

The persistence of these concerns since 2021 underscores how little progress has been made on core infrastructure and cost challenges.

Why it matters: Nissan is betting on U.S.-built hybrids to compete with Toyota while tariffs reshape the industry.

The Details

Meunier took over as Americas chairman in January 2025 during a company-wide crisis that included 9,000 job cuts and a failed merger with Honda.

The company’s U.S. market share has inched up from 4% to 5% this year by tailoring production to dealer demand rather than bulk output.

Nissan plans to bring its e-Power hybrid technology to the U.S. in 2026 with the Rogue, initially importing from Japan before ramping up Tennessee production in 2027.

Meunier met with U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn last week to discuss accelerating e-Power localization at the Decherd engine plant, according to The Tennessean.

“We need to start selling cars, make money, take care of the customer, forget the rest,” Meunier said. “Cut the bureaucracy, cut the things that don’t add value.”

By the Numbers

FY 2024-25 Operating Loss: 215.9 billion yen ($1.39 billion)

U.S. Market Share: 5% (up from 4%)

Pre-Billing Rate: 60% (up from 30% six months ago)

Rogue Sales Growth (Jul-Sep): +8.9% year-over-year

Pathfinder Sales Growth: +33.2%

Frontier Sales Growth: +19.2%

e-Power Rogue Production Goal (2027): 300,000 units annually in Smyrna

EVXL’s Take

Meunier’s back-to-basics approach shows early traction, but Nissan remains years behind Toyota on hybrids. While Toyota opened its $14 billion North Carolina battery plant last month and doubled down on the hybrid strategy it never abandoned, Nissan is scrambling to bring e-Power technology that debuted in Japan back in 2016. The timing is brutal: Nissan missed the hybrid boom that Toyota rode to record profits.

Tariffs are forcing Nissan’s hand. By localizing e-Power production in Tennessee, Meunier can sidestep import duties while positioning the company for a market that has decisively shifted away from pure EVs. The question is whether Nissan can execute fast enough. As we documented when Nissan posted its record $5.26 billion loss earlier this year, the company’s financial runway is shrinking.

Perhaps the most obvious of those other diminishing safety nets is groundwater. Data on groundwater reserves throughout the basin is spotty at best. One approximation of a truly regional assessment comes from a creative use of satellite-based tools—namely NASA’s GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) system that can detect tiny changes in gravitational forces associated with the fluctuating mass of aquifers losing (or gaining) storage. Those findings paint a truly disturbing picture. Despite the familiar (and troubling) images of bathtub rings emerging at Mead and Powell, researchers using GRACE data now estimate that, from 2002 to 2024, nearly two-thirds of storage—both surface and groundwater—lost in the Colorado River Basin actually came from groundwater depletions.2 Significant groundwater losses have occurred throughout the basin, but the problem is particularly acute in Arizona and is likely to accelerate as shortages in Central Arizona Project (CAP) deliveries are likely offset by groundwater pumping—an ironic outcome given that CAP was originally proposed as the solution to groundwater mining in the region. Simply shifting unsustainable surface water uses to unsustainable groundwater uses does nothing to address the core mismatch of supplies and demands.

A very different and multi-faceted trend undercutting the regional safety nets is happening within the federal government, where federal agencies, programs and science programs are being systematically dismantled under the guise of “efficiency.” It’s hard to understate the significance of these actions, as it is the federal government that, presumably, has the scope, mandate and resources to oversee the entirety of the River and the full diversity of its roles and values. Interior Department agencies in 2025, like much of the overall federal bureaucracy, have been tasked to achieve significant staffing reductions, and to eliminate (or significantly scale back) spending on key water conservation programs—including programs under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and WaterSMART.3

Additionally, agencies across the federal landscape have mobilized to coerce and shut down climate-related science and scientists, despite the nearly universal acknowledgment among water managers of the central role of climate change in the unfolding crisis.4 Collectively these efforts constitute a systematic effort to discredit and hide the primary cause of the broken water budget, while sabotaging the most effective coping mechanisms available. As members of the research community, the Colorado River Research Group (CRRG)unfortunately has a front-row seat to this culling of the people and programs essential to long-term data collection and analysis. It defies logic, and is dangerous.

Unfortunately, hostility toward the people and programs essential to responding to the Colorado River crisis is not the full extent of federal obstruction. One largely unappreciated threat to the water budget resulting from federal policy shifts comes from efforts to “re-carbonize” (and accelerate) water-intensive energy generation, in part to meet the demands of AI, a particularly troubling trend given that the previous emphasis on renewable energy generation and enhanced energy conservation was one of the few positive trends working to repair the regional water budget.5 Attempts to weaken or dismantle bedrock environmental laws, such as NEPA and the Endangered Species Act, are an additional wildcard likely to inflict irreparable harm on already strained species and ecosystems.6

Given the turmoil at the federal level, it’s tempting to absolve the States for stubbornly clinging to a policy making system reliant on 7-state dealmaking, but that would ignore the reality that the governance of the river has been a problem for decades. A seemingly never-ending series of crisis-inspired negotiations, held in largely secretive forums without direct tribal involvement or tools for meaningful public or scientific engagement, is an uninspired way to manage and protect the economic, cultural and environmental heart of the American Southwest. The river is too big and too important to govern in such an ad hoc and primitive manner. [ed. emphasis mine]

That this approach mostly ”worked” to keep deliveries flowing for so long—except, of course, for the tribes and the environment—rested, in part, on the accepted norm that decisions would emerge collaboratively from the States and would not spill over to the federal courts. But even that governance safety net is eroding, as the States seem to be increasingly resigned—and almost “comfortable”—with the notion that the resolution of existing conflicts may not emerge from a negotiated 7-state agreement. For those parties and viewpoints that have historically been left out of the state-dominated processes and the resulting agreements, then maybe this prospect is welcome. But all would concede that would be a stunning outcome with ramifications that are difficult to predict.

Ever since the Arizona v. California experience, the use of litigation to resolve interstate (and/or interbasin) conflicts in the basin has been a third rail issue, and for very good reasons. As shown by the basin’s earlier foray into Supreme Court action, the process would undoubtedly be lengthy, expensive, and likely to create as many issues and questions as it resolves. It certainly wouldn’t reduce risk, as the states, and the water management community more broadly, would lose control over the process of managing the shared resource. In fact, judicial intervention might be the impetus to trigger yet another traditionally feared decision pathway to be invoked—a Congressional rewrite of river allocation and management—either before or after the litigation concludes. In this setting, the extreme disparity in political influence—as measured by the number of Congressional representatives—between the Upper and Lower Basin is an obvious concern, as is the realization that congressional involvement means the future of the Colorado now becomes a national issue and, potentially, a bargaining chip to be used in the political logrolling necessary to enact legislation in dozens of otherwise unrelated areas.

In Colorado, as in most of the West, older water rights take priority over newer ones when there’s not enough water to satisfy everyone’s claims. On the Colorado River, the Shoshone Hydropower rights limit the amount of water that can be taken out of the river upstream by junior rights that divert water from the river’s headwaters through tunnels under the Continental Divide to cities and farms on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. The new deal to enable the Shoshone rights to be used for environmental flows would preserve those limitations on transmountain diversions in perpetuity.

Upstream from the power plant, near the ranching town of Kremmling, Colorado, the river carries less than half the water it would without the existing transmountain diversions. This stresses fish populations and the iconic cottonwood groves that line the river. The Shoshone rights downstream prevent these diversions from being even larger. Because the power plant returns all the water it uses to the river without consuming it, the water continues to provide benefits downstream from the plant to rafters, farms, cities and four species of endangered fish that exist only in the Colorado River Basin. Securing these flows for the future is particularly important as climate change continues to reduce the river’s flow, which has already declined by roughly 20% over the past two decades.

The people cheering in the hearing room represented cities, towns, counties and irrigation districts from up and down the Colorado River. Their entities had pledged ratepayer and taxpayer dollars to help secure the rights in the complex transaction spearheaded by the Colorado River Water Conservation District. Environmental organizations, including American Rivers, Audubon, Trout Unlimited and Western Resource Advocates, were also parties to the hearing and supportive of the deal, but were vastly outnumbered.

The Coloradans cheering in that room were there because their constituents’ livelihoods, clean drinking water and quality of life depend on a living Colorado River. American Rivers is proud to stand with them and will continue advocating for the completion of this historic water transaction.",https://s0.wp.com/_si/?t=eyJpbWciOiJodHRwczpcL1wvczAud3AuY29tXC9pXC9ibGFuay5qcGciLCJ0eHQiOiJDb3lvdGUgR3VsY2giLCJ0ZW1wbGF0ZSI6ImhpZ2h3YXkiLCJmb250IjoiIiwiYmxvZ19pZCI6MjIzNTg4NX0.c9FY6ukBzqqbZLFtzGkgYmc-PXMm5LZtBxVTZM5Qm3UMQ,N,,2025-12-12 21:59:47.664679

For the first time ever, and after decades of failure, the world’s countries agreed to a single international climate treaty — one that applied to developed and developing countries alike.

Since then, international climate diplomacy has played out on what is, more or less, the Paris Agreement’s calendar. The quasi-quinquennial rhythm of countries setting goals, reviewing them, and then making new ones has held since 2015. A global pandemic has killed millions of people; Russia has invaded Ukraine; coups and revolutions have begun and ended — and the United States has joined and left and rejoined the treaty, then left again — yet its basic framework has remained.

Perhaps you can tell: I am not among those who believe that the treaty has been a failure, although it would be difficult — in this politically arid moment — to call it a complete success. Yet the ensuing decade has seen real progress in limiting global temperature rise. When negotiators gathered to finalize the agreement, it seemed likely that global average temperatures could rise by 4 degrees Celsius by 2100, as compared to their pre-industrial level. Today, a rise from 2.5 to 3 degrees Celsius seems more likely.

And for a document that is often described as non-binding, or even as hortatory, Paris has had a surprisingly material influence on global politics in the ensuing years. During the negotiations, the small-island states — the three dozen or so countries most affected by near-term sea-level rise — successfully got the final text to recognize a “stretch goal” of limiting warming to just 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. They also tasked the United Nations’ advisory scientific body to prepare a special report on the virtues of avoiding 1.5 degrees of warming. When that report was released in 2018, it catalyzed a new wave of global climate action, spawning the European Green Deal — and eventually the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.

Yet there is at least one way that Paris did not go as imagined.

Cast your mind back to Paris 10 years ago, right as diplomats filed in and began to applaud the final text’s completion. “This is a tremendous victory for all of our citizens — not for any one country or any one bloc, but for everybody here who has worked so hard to bring us across the finish line,” John Kerry, then the U.S. secretary of state, declared to his fellow diplomats.

It was a strange kind of victory. After decades in which western liberals had attempted to secure a globally binding climate treaty — an agreement that would limit each country’s greenhouse gas emissions — the world finally won a non-binding alternative. Under the Paris Agreement, each country would pledge to cut its emissions by as much as it could manage. Countries would then meet regularly to review these pledges, encourage each other to get more ambitious, and gradually ratchet the world into a lower-carbon future.

Kerry was reasonably direct about how such a mechanism would work: capital markets. “We are sending literally a critical message to the global marketplace,” he said. “Many of us here know that it won’t be governments that actually make the decision or find the product, the new technology, the saving grace of this challenge. It will be the genius of the American spirit.”

He was right, in a way: The Paris Agreement did send a signal to the global marketplace— and it did so in part because governments did shape policy and investment outcomes, not because they resisted doing so. But it did not reveal the genius of the American spirit, per se.

In the years running up to and following the Paris Agreement, China rolled out a series of important policies to boost its new energy sectors — a roadmap encouraging “new energy vehicle” sales in 2012, billions of consumer subsidies beginning in 2014, and a domestic content mandate for electric-vehicle batteries in 2015. These programs — along with canny decisions made by Chinese entrepreneurs and engineers, and no small amount of demand pull from companies and policies in the West — have transformed the world’s approach to decarbonization. They have begun to change even what decarbonization means — in the United States, in the western democracies, and around the world.

Ten years ago, Kerry could assume that any eventual solution to climate change would be geopolitically neutral, if not advantageous to the United States. But in 2025, to a degree that commentators still hesitate to describe, the climate story has become the China story. Across a range of sectors, how a country approaches its near-term decarbonization goals depends on how it understands and relates to the Chinese government and Chinese companies.

Consider the power sector, which generates just under a third of all greenhouse gas emissions globally. For many countries, the best way to cut carbon pollution — and to add more power generation to the grid — will be to build new utility-scale solar and battery projects. That will all but require working with Chinese firms, which dominate 80% of the solar supply chain. (They command up to 98% market share for some pieces of equipment, according to the International Energy Agency.)

It is much the same story in the grid-scale battery industry. China produces more than three-quarters of the world’s batteries, and it refines most of the minerals that go into those batteries. Its batteries are at least 20% cheaper than those made in Europe or North America. Most of the world’s top battery firms are Chinese — in part because they have more experience than anyone else; the country’s firms have manufactured 70% of all lithium-ion batteries ever produced. Nearly two dozen countries have bought at least $500 million in Chinese-made batteries this year, according to the think tank Ember.

What if a country wants to build wind turbines, not batteries? Even then, it will have to work to buy non-Chinese products. Although European and American firms have long led among turbine makers, six of the top 10 wind turbine manufacturers are now in mainland China, according to BloombergNEF. And for the first time since analysts’ rankings began in 2013, none of the world’s top three turbine makers are North American or European.

Transportation generates another 13% of global climate emissions. If a country wants to tackle that sector, then it will find itself (again) working with China — which made more than 70% of the world’s EVs in 2024. Thanks to the country’s sprawling battery and electronics-making ecosystem, its home-grown automakers — BYD, Geely, Xiaomi, and others — can produce more affordable, innovative, and desirable EVs at greater scale and at lower cost than automakers anywhere else. “The competitive reality is that the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry,” Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, said recently. As the scholar Ilaria Mazzocco put it in a recent report: “Chinese companies are ubiquitous in the value chain for EVs and battery components, meaning that for most countries, climate policy is now at least in part linked to policy toward China, and more specifically trade with China.”

That insight — that climate policy is now linked to policy toward China — will apply more and more, even when countries wish to tackle the remaining third of emissions that come from energy-related sources. Earlier this year, China approved a plan to build roughly 100 low-carbon industrial parks by 2030, where its firms will develop new ways to capture carbon, make steel, and refine chemicals without carbon pollution. (The Trump administration revoked funding for similar low-carbon projects in the U.S. earlier this year.) At the same time, China is building more conventional nuclear reactors than the rest of the world combined, and it may be pulling ahead of the United States in the race to develop commercial fusion.

This wasn’t inevitable. It happened because Chinese politicians, executives, and engineers decided to make it happen — choices owing as much to the government’s focus on energy security as to its concern for the global environmental commons. But it was also the result of American business leaders and politicians squandering this country’s leadership in climate technologies — and especially the result of choices made by Trump administration officials, who at nearly every opportunity have regarded batteries and electric vehicles as a technological sideshow to the more profitable oil and gas sector.

It was the Trump administration, after all, that licensed and then eventually gave U.S.-funded research on flow batteries to a Chinese company in 2017. It was the Trump administration that gutted fuel economy and clean car rules in 2018 and 2019, setting the American car industry back compared to its Chinese and European competitors. And it was the Trump administration and congressional Republicans that killed electric vehicle tax credits earlier this year, further choking off investment.

For progressives, this all might suggest a pleasant parable: China embraced the energy transition, and America didn’t, and now America is paying for it. Nowadays, commentators often invoke China’s clean energy dominance to inspire awe at its accomplishments. And how can you not, in truth, be impressed? China’s industrial miracle — its move to the frontier of global technological development — is the most important story of the past quarter century. The scale of the Chinese consumer market and the success of Chinese industrial policy (or, at least, its success so far) has wrenched world history in new directions. And Chinese companies have done humanity a great service by bringing down the cost of solar panels, batteries, and EVs on the supply side, even if they did so at first with demand-side assistance from policies in California or Europe.

But climate advocates in North America and Europe cannot be completely sanguine about what this development means globally. For environmentalists and other western liberals who have worked in decarbonization for decades, it will in particular require some rhetorical and political adjustment. We cannot pretend that we are playing by the 1990s’ rules, nor that environmental activism is but one part of a post-1970s progressive coalition, which is free to make demands and ignore inconvenient trade-offs. Basic questions of decarbonization policy now have patent geopolitical significance, which environmental groups attempt to side-step at their own peril.

Yet it isn’t only Americans or Europeans who must answer these questions. China’s dominance of decarbonization technology means that for the time being, every country on Earth must address this dynamic. When the scholar Mazzocco looked at how six countries around the world are approaching Chinese EVs, she found an uneven landscape, she told me on a recent podcast. Costa Rica, which has long embraced climate policy, has welcomed Chinese-made EVs; Brazil opened its doors to them but has now begun to close it.

Most major countries have some form of domestic automaking industry; no country will be able to sit back and passively allow Chinese exports to drive their local automakers out of business. At the same time, China’s manufacturing primacy is already making conventional export-driven growth less attractive for countries. And that will only be the beginning of the dilemmas to come. As long as going green requires buying and integrating Chinese technologies into critical infrastructure, environmental policymakers will be wagering decarbonization’s success on some of the world’s highest stakes geopolitical bets.

Environmentalists have long insisted climate change is a national security issue, but are we ready to think and act like it is? Do Western anxieties about a large and globalized war — either a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a Russian invasion of the EU, or both — reflect a reasonable response to a real and growing menace, or an elite panic driven by our declining economic primacy? If China were to invade Taiwan, what would that mean for climate and energy policy — not only in the West, but around the world? Would American or European environmentalists even get a vote on that question — and if they do, how would they balance emissions reduction against other goals? If the unthinkable happens, we will all be called to account.

A decade ago, I remember watching the live stream of the world’s diplomats applauding their own success in Paris and realizing that I would be seeing that video in documentaries and news reels for the rest of my life. How will I see it then? I wondered. Would it strike me as the naivete of a simpler time, an era when liberal internationalism still seemed possible? Or would it really reflect a turning point, the moment when the world took the climate challenge seriously, pragmatically, and began to decarbonize in earnest? A decade later, I still don’t know. Perhaps the answer is both.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjM0NTA4Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDM4OTY5OX0.eedqTiD2E1YHyRgnRHgQq28I74lf7ahVhGlpcoSeNEM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:37.545558

The new capital, approved under a Hawai‘i Public Utilities Commission order, will enable more households, nonprofits, and small businesses in the Hawaiian Electric service area to install renewable energy systems and efficiency upgrades. The commission’s order recognizes the urgency of expanding affordable financing options as federal tax credit rules evolve and national policy changes reshape the solar market.

This additional funding comes at a critical time. federal Solar for All funds are tied up in litigation, and the federal solar Investment tax credit for homeowner-owned systems is set to expire Dec. 31. Although commercial tax credits remain available through 2027, many projects face shortened timelines due to new federal legislation.

Authority Executive Director Gwen Yamamoto-Lau said the agency is moving quickly to fill that gap for local customers.

“We are thrilled with the PUC’s approval to modify Order No. 34930, allowing us to make $18 million in additional loan capital immediately available,” Yamamoto-Lau said. “With Hawai‘i’s high electricity costs, this support will help nonprofits, small businesses, and low- and moderate-income households reduce their energy burden and improve resiliency.”

Through the authority’s Green Energy Money $aver on-bill repayment program, customers can finance clean energy improvements — including solar photovoltaic systems, battery storage, solar water heaters, heat pump water heaters, and commercial energy-efficiency retrofits — without the need for traditional tax incentives. Loan eligibility and projected savings are calculated independently of federal tax credits.

The GEMS program, established by Act 211 (2013), was designed to make clean energy financing more inclusive by providing below-market rates and flexible loan terms for those who may not qualify for conventional financing. These investments are expected to advance Hawai‘i’s target of 100% clean energy by 2045 while driving job growth and innovation in the local energy economy.

The rare joint effort between the factions — factions that fought tooth-and-nail during the 2025 legislative session over labor’s attempt to make it easier for Colorado workers to unionize and take union negotiating fees directly from paychecks — was meant to call attention to the range of leaders concerned about this issue. In six panel discussions at the north Denver headquarters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union, speakers detailed rising costs linked to environmental restrictions, lost job opportunities and a declining business atmosphere in the state.

If Black Hills Energy were forced to implement Colorado’s newly approved Clean Heat Plan immediately, it would increase customers’ bills by $215 per month, said Maria Garduna, sustainability and climate senior manager for the utility. Meanwhile, the state’s focus on boosting renewable energy sources is limiting job opportunities and making it harder to attract jobs in fields like manufacturing, said Gary Arnold, business manager for the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters.

“We came together out of a simple idea — Colorado can meet the state’s climate and energy goals while balancing that with affordability. Our mission is to bring practical, real-world solutions to those goals,” said Ray Rivera, coalition director for the newly formed Colorado Energy Crossroads. “The challenges we’re facing aren’t theoretical. They’re here now. They’re real. This is happening.”

State has passed numerous laws to cut emissions

Gov. Jared Polis and Democratic legislators have worked since 2019 to reduce emissions through new mandates, pointing repeatedly to the northern Front Range’s noncompliance with federal ozone standards. Air pollution leads to increased respiratory and cardiovascular afflictions and has left leaders in some communities near industrial sites complaining they are subject to constant dirty air that triggers asthma attacks and forces residents to stay inside.

Since the Democratic governor took office six years ago, the state has enacted emissions-reduction rules on the oil-and-gas industry, manufacturing sites, large commercial buildings and even users of gas-powered lawn-and-garden equipment. Several representatives of environmental groups and Polis’ administration, as well as legislators who supported the new laws, attended Friday’s event but did not speak on any panels.

Over that time, however, it also has gotten prohibitively expensive to live and do business in Colorado and has led to the loss of numerous job-expansion opportunities that the state used to win, several business leaders on the panels said. Colorado Chamber of Commerce President/CEO Loren Furman noted Colorado has the third-highest housing costs, the fifth-highest cost of living and the 13th-highest cost of doing business. according to sources like CNBC and U.S. News & World Report — in no small part due to it having the 6th-most regulations nationally.

Limiting sources of energy a shared problem for groups

The Clean Heat Plan, a proposal approved last week by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission that calls for a 41% reduction in home-heating emissions in 10 years and 100% electrification of homes by 2050, took significant criticism from panel participants. Garduna noted natural gas cost four times less in 2024 than a similar amount of electricity, and Sara Espinoza Blackhurst, president/CEO of the Action 22 group representing union-heavy southeast Colorado, said the decision shows a “disregard for labor.”

Melissa Shatler — assistant director of labor outreach and workforce equity for Climate Jobs, an organization trying to bridge the gap between unions and environmental activists — said such decisions show the need for labor representatives on deliberative panels. Dan Hendricks, apprenticeship training director for the Joint Electrical Apprenticeship and Training Committee, decried the state’s focus on getting people trained to install solar panels or build windmills and said it should adopt an “all-of-the-above” approach to preparing Coloradans to work in fields using both traditional and renewable energy.

“If you’re going to train a wind tech, shame on you. If you’re going to train a solar tech, shame on you. We need to train electricians,” said Hendricks, a longtime labor leader. “You need an agile, well-trained workforce that can work anywhere, not just one pigeonholed job that you believe you need right now.”

Further emissions-reduction mandates under consideration

Friday’s event came two days after Polis released a report arguing that the state needs to streamline its workforce-development programs under one new state agency, in order to give students and employers easier access to a wide range of job-training programs.

And the event comes as some Democratic legislators have discussed running a bill in 2026 that would speed up by 10 years, to 2040, the deadline for utilities to get to net-zero carbon emissions. The status of the bill is uncertain, as it’s received significant pushback from utility, business and labor leaders — largely the same coalition that came together at IBEW HQ — because of its costs and potential impacts on jobs of gasline-maintenance workers and others.

A survey commissioned by the coalition and done by Searchlight Research and Impact Research, found that state residents generally backed the current goals but pulled back on support when asked about speeding up the deadline and potentially increasing utility costs. The same poll found that two-thirds of respondents support a mix of energy that involves natural gas, wind, solar, geothermal and nascent nuclear resources rather than a renewable-energy-only approach and that 54% of likely voters said they would be less likely to support a candidate wanting to speed up the 2050 deadline.

Coalition to keep raising voices on energy issues

“The primacy of economic concerns, the affordability concerns … was one of my most important takeaways,” Impact Research partner Jeff Liszt said.

Coalition members didn’t announce a next step following the Friday summit but said they are planning to continue to press the message that Colorado needs to consider affordability, as well as resiliency of its electric grid, as it considers climate actions. And they hope that by bringing together partners who don’t always see eye to eye, Polis and other leaders will consider the message as one that comes from a wide swath of people.

“What we heard today is that Coloradans have a deep focus and a bent to doing the right thing environmentally — but at the same time, a big focus on affordability,” said Dave Davia, president/CEO of business group Colorado Concern.",https://tsscolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Energy-Summit-Davia-Panel-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:45.332334

The state Legislature would need to pass another law to allow PG&E to operate the power plant past 2030.","PG&E is one step closer to keeping Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant open until 2030.

On Thursday, the California Coastal Commission voted 9-3 to give PG&E a coastal development permit that will extend the power plant’s life.

The permit requires PG&E to dedicate thousands of acres of surrounding land to conservation to offset the negative environmental impacts of plant’s seawater once-through cooling system.

The nuclear power plant still needs two more approvals to continue operating.

PG&E presented a smaller mitigation package to the commission in November, which was rejected. After pushback from state legislators and the public, the commission told PG&E to go back to the drawing board and return with a more expansive land conservation plan.

On Thursday, the majority of the commissioners accepted PG&E’s proposal.

“The increased mitigations will be of significant benefit for the state of California for years to come,” commissioner Megan Harmon said.

The commission also took a vote that’s a step toward extending the plant’s life an additional 15 years, to 2045.

Why does PG&E need to offer a land conservation package?

The power pant’s cooling system sucks in about 2.5 billion gallons of seawater per day, which could fill almost 3,800 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The system also inhales small marine organisms, which are often killed by the change in water pressure and temperature, the staff report said.

Operating the plant for another five years would kill billions of those marine organisms, which would negatively impact about 14 square miles of nearshore waters, the staff report said.

Such a significant environmental impact does not comply with the California Coastal Management Program or the California Coastal Act.

However, the commission can approve permits for coastal-dependent industrial facilities like the power plant if it can prove that the project won’t harm the public and the environmental impacts are mitigated to the “maximum extent feasible,” the staff report said.

Commission staff determined that building replacement marine habitat, like an artificial reef, was not a feasible option, because such projects have inconsistent success rates.

Instead, PG&E offered a land conservation package.

A more expansive mitigation package

After the November meeting, PG&E and commission staff revised the mitigation package.

“This collaboration has led to the chance to preserve these 14 miles of coastline,” PG&E representative Tom Jones said at the meeting.

The updated mitigation package includes the following:

A 4,500-acre conservation easement to be placed on the North Ranch property, which is 3,400 acres larger than the conservation easement PG&E originally proposed. PG&E will also attempt to dedicate the fee title of the North Ranch to a public agency, a nonprofit land conservation organization or a Native American tribe.

Conservation easements for 25 miles of trails on the property, including a trail that connects Montaña de Oro State Park to Port San Luis. Previously, PG&E only offered 10 miles of new trails in the mitigation package.

A $10 million endowment for the design, planning, construction and maintenance of those trails. This is $4.4 million larger than the original proposal.

The option to sell the fee title for the 2,400-acre Wild Cherry Canyon property to a state agency, a nonprofit conservation organization or a Native American tribe that also obtains an agreement to purchase the lease from HomeFed Corp. at fair market value.

A prohibition on the sale of the South Ranch property for purposes other than conservation until 2040. Originally, PG&E offered only a first right of refusal for the property’s purchase to state agencies and nonprofit conservation organizations.

“These six elements would provide a pathway to the permanent conservation of nearly all of the 12,000 acres of the Diablo Canyon lands in order to offset the project’s effects on marine life,” commission deputy director Cassidy Teufel said.

PG&E offered additional mitigations if the state Legislature extends the plant’s operating life beyond 2030, which include:

A deed restriction on almost 2,500 acres of the South Ranch, which would require a conservation easement as part of the purchase of the property.

An 18-month first right of refusal for government agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations and Native American tribes for the South Ranch property.

An 18-month first right of refusal for government agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations and Native American tribes for the underlying fee title of Wild Cherry Canyon. Starting on Oct. 31, 2030, the buyer of the fee title would not need to have an agreement to purchase the lease from HomeFed.

State Sen. John Laird led lobbying efforts to expand the mitigation package. While he would have preferred direct, immediate conservation of the South Ranch, he was pleased with the rest of the proposal, calling it “a monumental victory.”

“This is remarkable progress, and I think generations of people will thank us,” he said at the meeting.

State Assemblymember Dawn Addis, however, urged the commission to require PG&E to preserve the entirety of the South Ranch immediately.

“I think today is a real opportunity to restore accountability and to restore trust when it comes to potential continued operations of the nuclear power plant,” she said.

Still, both legislators celebrated the expansion of the proposal.

Tribal co-management of the land

Multiple leaders from Indigenous tribes urged the commission to include tribal co-management of the land as part of the mitigation package, but they suggested different approaches.

Mona Olivas Tucker, the tribal chair of the yak titʸu titʸu yak tiłhini Northern Chumash Tribe of San Luis Obispo County, said her tribe is the only nation that has been “definitively established as the indigenous people of this territory.”

“We have family stories, archaeological, genealogical and anthropological evidence to substantiate our claim,” she said.

She said the mitigation package should offer the first right of refusal for the South Ranch to the ytt Tribe.

“The proposed mitigation fails to prioritize tribal land-back efforts and instead places barriers between ytt and Diablo lands,” she said.

Michael Khus-Zarate, the vice chair of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, said his tribe also claims lineage to the Diablo lands.

The Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation stayed on-site to protect their ancestors while they were removed from their graves during construction of the power plant, he said.

“Later, over a four-year period, I led solstice ceremonies with our people in the shadow of the nuclear containment structures, praying that there would be no nuclear accidents and that someday the place would be returned to its natural state of peace and beauty once the plant was gone,” he said.

He advised the commission to consult with all tribes associated with the land.

“You must be as inclusive and expansive as possible,” he said.

Northern Chumash Tribal Council Chairwoman Violet Sage Walker also said that all tribes affiliated with the land should be consulted and have an opportunity to manage the property.

“While we support the preservation of the lands around Diablo Canyon, we do not support the inclusion of public access without having developed a robust tribal co-management plan, tribal stewardship program, which includes all tribes culturally affiliated with the lands, including North Ranch, South Ranch, Wild Cherry Canyon,” she said.

What is the vision for Wild Cherry Canyon?

Wild Cherry Canyon is about 2,400 acres of idyllic, undeveloped land behind Avila Beach.

PG&E’s subsidiary, Eureka Energy, owns the underlying fee title to the property, while the development company HomeFed Corp. owns a 141-year lease on the land. Multiple rounds of litigation determined that HomeFed’s lease is valid.

The mitigation package will give a state agency, nonprofit conservation organization or Native American tribe the chance to purchase the underlying fee title to the property if they can strike a deal to purchase the lease from HomeFed.

At the meeting, HomeFed’s attorney Robert Shoecraft said the corporation is willing to sell the lease for fair market value.

An Oct. 26, 2020, appraisal showed that the lease was worth $39 million, though that number could have changed over the past five years, he said.

Meanwhile, the state Legislature allocated $40 million to the purchase of Wild Cherry Canyon. That money just needs to get into the hands of an organization that wishes to manage the property.

During public comment, The Wildlands Conservancy executive director Frazier Haney said his organization would be interested in the property. The Wildlands Conservancy is a nonprofit that protects land in California, managing it for conservation, habitat restoration and public access.

“I’m really excited that we can now see a clear path forward,” commissioner Caryl Hart said of Wild Cherry Canyon at the meeting.

What’s next on the Diablo Canyon permit?

On Thursday, the commission also voted 9-3 to certify that extending the power plant’s operating life another 20 years complies with the California Coastal Management Program.

This allows the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to approve PG&E’s application for a 20-year license to operate the power plant.

However, even if the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves a 20-year license, PG&E can only run the power plant for five years under current state law. The state Legislature would need to pass another law to allow PG&E to operate the power plant past 2030.

The commission reviewed two timelines because PG&E applied for a five-year permit at the state level and a 20-year license at the federal level. The NRC license would allow Diablo to operate until 2044 and 2045 — but only with the state Legislature’s permission and an amendment to the five-year coastal development permit.

After securing a coastal development permit from the California Coastal Commission, PG&E must get a permit to operate the once-through cooling system in February from the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board and a license next year from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

If PG&E is successful in all of those steps, Unit 1 can operate until Oct. 31, 2029, and Unit 2 can operate until Oct. 31, 2030.",https://www.sanluisobispo.com/public/latest-news/t5udi6/picture251849773/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/BIZ-ENV-NUKES-CALIF-1-LA.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 23:58:05.167271

Our evidence suggests that, at least for congressional leaders, political power and private portfolios are uncomfortably intertwined.
Hill, M L (2025), “Anna Paulina Luna pushes for vote on congressional stock trading ban”, Politico, 2 December.","The debate over whether US members of Congress should be allowed to trade individual stocks has moved from a niche ethics topic to a mainstream policy concern. Media investigations have documented pandemic-era sell-offs following closed-door COVID-19 briefings, widespread trading in industries overseen by members’ own committees, and dozens of apparent violations of the 2012 Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act. Against this backdrop, proposals to ban stock trading by lawmakers are gaining traction in Washington. In the latest development, on 2 December 2025, Representative Anna Paulina Luna filed a discharge petition to force a House vote on banning individual stock trading by members of Congress (Hill 2025).

Economists have been trying to assess whether legislators’ portfolios actually earn abnormal returns, and if so, why. Early work by Ziobrowski et al. (2004, 2011) suggested that House and Senate members outperformed the market. Later studies reversed the verdict: Eggers and Hainmueller (2013) and Belmont et al. (2022) find that, on average, members would have been better off in index funds. Cherry et al. (2017) highlight that some senators earned significant sell-side gains around key legislative events, while Huang and Xuan (2023) show that abnormal performance largely disappeared after the STOCK Act. Related work on investors documents that access to policymakers can confer an informational advantage in capital markets, as evidenced by Fons-Rosen et al. (2020) on trading related to the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program.

Taken together, this literature paints a mixed picture: there are pockets of advantage, but not a simple story in which ‘Congress always beats the market’. Our contribution is to zoom in on a small but crucial group: congressional leaders. Rather than treating all lawmakers as alike, we ask whether gaining formal leadership power – Speaker, floor leader, whip, or caucus chair – changes how well a member’s personal investments perform.

Leadership and trading performance

Our study uses transaction-level data on every US congressional stock trade from 1995 to 2021 and links them to firm characteristics, regulatory actions, procurement contracts, and corporate news. We identify all individuals who ever held a leadership position and match each of them to a ‘regular’ member with similar tenure, party, chamber, age, and gender. We then follow both groups over time and compare their risk-adjusted buy-and-hold returns before and after leadership ascension.

Before entering leadership, future leaders and their matched peers underperform the market by similar amounts. After ascension, however, their trajectories diverge sharply: leaders’ trades outperform those of their matched peers by up to roughly 40–50 percentage points per year. The control group shows no comparable improvement. Calendar-time portfolio regressions using standard factor models confirm that leaders’ daily alphas rise markedly post-ascension, while non-leaders’ alphas remain flat.

Leadership positions are few – only 20 lawmakers in our sample trade both before and after ascension – so the results are not about ‘typical’ members of Congress. But leadership roles are exactly where agenda-setting power, regulatory influence, and corporate attention are concentrated. If one wants to know whether public power can be monetised in financial markets, this is where one should look.

We then ask: how do leaders manage to earn such outsized returns?

Channel 1: Political information and influence

The first mechanism is what we call the political information and influence channel. Leaders have privileged information about what legislation will be scheduled, which regulatory priorities are advancing, and which industries are likely to come under pressure. In majority leadership roles, they often help decide those outcomes. We implement several tests related to this channel.

Partisan control. When leaders’ own party controls the chamber they sit in, their trades are significantly more profitable than when they are in the minority. Returns rise with control over the legislative agenda.

Regulatory actions. We track regulatory events – investigations, enforcement actions, and congressional hearings – affecting firms whose stocks are traded. Leaders’ stock sales are followed by a marked increase in adverse regulatory events over the subsequent 3–12 months, while their purchases are not followed by a corresponding decline. This suggests that leaders sell ahead of bad political or regulatory news.

These tests show that leaders benefit from anticipatory trades around political developments. But are they merely informed observers, or do they also help shape outcomes in ways that enrich their portfolios?

Legislative voting. Using bill-level data on all measures reaching the floor, we identify those with meaningful implications for the economy or businesses. For each leader trade, we look at relevant bills introduced in the following months and classify whether each bill is likely to benefit or harm the traded firm. We find that, following stock purchases, the leader’s party is significantly more likely to vote for bills deemed beneficial to the firm and against bills deemed harmful. The number of such ‘aligned’ bills rises substantially relative to matched non-leaders over medium-term windows.

Procurement contracts. Drawing on the Federal Procurement Data System, we examine whether firms whose shares leaders buy subsequently receive more government contracts. They do: purchases are followed by significant increases in contract value and in the share of sole-source contracts. Given that the federal government awards millions of contracts each year but leaders only invest in a narrow subset of firms, it is hard to attribute this pattern solely to passive foresight. It is more consistent with selective influence over the allocation of public business. These procurement-related findings resonate with broader evidence that discretion in public procurement can foster favouritism and rent extraction (Bosio et al. 2020), and that close ties between politicians and firms can raise the cost of public contracts (Baránek and Titl 2024).

Taken together, these tests point to a political channel in which leaders both foresee and shape the policy and regulatory environment in ways that overlap with their personal portfolios.

Channel 2: Corporate access

The second mechanism is a corporate access channel. Firms have strong incentives to cultivate influential lawmakers, particularly those who control legislative calendars or command committee agendas. Sharing sensitive information is risky. If firms must choose which politicians to trust, giving an informational edge to leaders is a natural, if troubling, strategy. We again bring two pieces of evidence to bear.

Connections pay. After ascension, leaders earn significantly higher abnormal returns when trading in firms that either have contributed to their recent campaigns or are headquartered in their home states. The same patterns do not appear for otherwise similar non-leaders.

Predicting corporate news. Leaders’ purchases are followed by more positive news; their sales are followed by more negative news. This predictive power is concentrated in executive-controlled events (e.g. dividend changes, guidance revisions, or earnings delays). Leaders do not anticipate outside shocks better than others (e.g. lawsuits). Moreover, the same individuals did not display this ability before becoming leaders. This pattern strongly suggests that corporate insiders appear to selectively share material non-public information with lawmakers whose political clout makes them valuable allies.

Did the STOCK Act fix the problem?

The 2012 STOCK Act was passed amid bipartisan promises to ‘stop trading on congressional knowledge’. Subsequent work has found that, on average, members’ abnormal returns declined after its passage, and politically connected hedge funds also lost some of their edge (Gao and Huang 2016, Huang and Xuan 2023). For the median legislator, the law may indeed have narrowed opportunities for exploiting inside information.

For leaders, the story is less reassuring. In our data, their trade frequency falls after 2012 – consistent with greater scrutiny – but their average trade size and risk-adjusted returns remain largely intact. Calendar-time portfolio regressions show that post-ascension alphas stay positive and economically meaningful even when portfolios are constructed using public disclosure dates rather than actual execution dates.

Policy implications: Focusing on the top of the pyramid

Our findings concern a narrow but highly consequential slice of Congress: the small group of leaders at the top of the political hierarchy. We do not imply that every lawmaker is quietly beating the market – if anything, the broader literature points to underperformance for rank-and-file members. But they do show that when political power is highly concentrated, so too is the capacity to turn public office into a trading advantage.

This concentration makes enforcement difficult. Traditional insider-trading laws and transparency rules are poorly suited to a world in which decision-makers both receive and generate price-sensitive information, and where conflicted actions may be legal yet still corrosive to trust. So, what can be done?

One response, increasingly advocated by reformers, is a blanket ban on individual stock ownership for sitting members, with assets limited to broad index funds or genuinely blind trusts. Short of that, lawmakers could tighten disclosure windows, raise penalties, and create independent oversight for trades by those in leadership roles, alongside stricter rules on procurement conflicts and legislative recusal.

Ultimately, the question is not whether some members of Congress are ‘smart investors’, but whether a healthy democracy should allow its most powerful officials to hold concentrated positions in the companies whose fortunes they help shape. Our evidence suggests that, at least for congressional leaders, political power and private portfolios are uncomfortably intertwined.

The power station is important to Yorkshire’s economy, supporting local businesses through our operations and supply chains and giving multiple generations the opportunity to build their skills and develop their careers in the county.

The new agreement we have made with the UK Government provides certainty that Drax can continue to support UK energy security as well as helping drive economic growth into the 2030s. It is also underpinned by strengthened sustainability criteria, which has been updated in line with the latest science and best practice.

Under the agreement, when the UK does not have enough electricity Drax can step in to increase generation, avoiding the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity Drax can turn down and help to balance the system.

Baringa’s analysis of the new deal says it will result in a net saving for consumers of up to £3.1bn over its term. This is because the deal avoids the need to produce additional capacity and reduces the country’s reliance on fossil fuels and interconnectors.

In line with the policies of successive Governments, we invested hundreds of millions in converting Drax Power Station to sustainable biomass generation as well as maintaining it so that it is available when the country needs it – particularly when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.

This investment has meant, unlike every single other former coal fired power station in Yorkshire, Drax Power Station remains operational and continues to play its vital role.

Critically the new deal also provides us with a foundation to progress options for the power station so it can remain operational well into the future.

One long-standing opportunity is to install the carbon removals and renewable power technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), at the power station which we continue to consider. But this project requires the right support from UK Government, including the development of a business model and importantly a regional carbon transport and storage network to connect to.

We are also exploring the options of hosting a data centre at Drax Power Station, which could be complementary to our BECCS plans and potentially attract billions in investment into the region.

With a grid connection, 24/7 power availability, significant amounts of development land, cooling infrastructure and a high-skilled and dedicated workforce the site has all the key requirements a large hyperscale data centre would need to be developed.

As part of this, we are proud to be participating in York & North Yorkshire’s AI Growth Zone bid, and we continue to have conversations with developers on how a data centre could be deployed at the power station.

With projections that data centres could account for up to 14 per cent of the UKs power demand by 2035, ensuring there is sufficient generation capacity for them is a critical security of supply question.

In the future, once we have fulfilled our obligations to the UK Government, we could provide power to a data centre generated at Drax and paid for by data centre users.

This would help the site move away from a bill payer supported model while continuing to help meet national energy demand.",https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Will-Gardiner_Sept25_terrace-14.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:59.416167

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is pleased to submit the following comments in response to the administration’s Request for Information for a National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing. ITIF is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.

1. a. Which emerging science and technology areas (e.g., artificial intelligence) will be key to the next generation of innovative advanced manufacturing technologies, and how will they impact advanced manufacturing?

A wide suite of digital manufacturing technologies—including artificial intelligence (AI) (and individual AI applications such as AR/VR, computer vision, expert systems, digital twins, and robotic process automation), big data, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, sensors, robots/cobots, advanced wireless communications, and computer-aided design (CAD) and engineering (CAE) software—tools are poised to transform modern manufacturing. In fact, digital services now account for 25 percent of manufacturing inputs.[1] And electronic inputs account for 40 percent of the value of a modern vehicle.[2]

The application of digital manufacturing technologies will be significant. Analysts expect manufacturing digitalization to boost overall global factory productivity up to 25 percent.[3] One assessment finds manufacturing digitalization could produce a 10 percent improvement in overall operating efficiency; 25 percent improvement in energy efficiency; 25 percent reduction in consumer packaging; 25 percent reduction in safety accidents; 40 percent reduction in cycle times; and 40 percent reduction in water usage.[4] Overall, economists estimate manufacturing digitalization could boost annual U.S. productivity growth by 1 to 1.5 percentage points and add $10 to $15 trillion to global GDP over the next 20 years.[5]

Manufacturers stand at differing levels of implementing smart manufacturing solutions. One March 2025 study of over 800 large multinational manufacturers found that 98 percent have at least initiated digital transformation efforts seeking to improve their customer experience and operational efficiency, optimize costs, or enhance products.[6] However, implementation of digital manufacturing solutions is decidedly lower among small- to medium-sized (SME) manufacturers. A 2024 survey conducted by the Interdisciplinary Center for Advanced Manufacturing Systems (ICAMS) at Auburn University found that 56 percent of U.S. SME manufacturers were either currently using or now implementing automation tools and 49 percent using additive manufacturing, but that only 38 percent were using big data, only 28 percent AI, and only 27 percent data analytics.[7]

The United States significantly trails in the deployment of robotics—a cross-cutting automation tool that will be vital to the competitiveness of myriad U.S. manufacturing industries. In fact, China has installed more industrial robots than the rest of the world combined in each of the past five years. When nations are assessed by their deployment of industrial robots per 10,000 workers, the United States ranks tenth, while China ranks third.[8] The United States needs to significantly scale up its deployment of industrial robots, and ITIF laid out a strategy to do so in its recent report “A Time to Act: Policies to Strengthen the US Robotics Industry.” Several recommendations which stood out from the report include that the United States should develop a national strategy for robotics, the Department of Commerce should convene a robotics industry advisory group to advise the U.S. government on robotics industry needs and how to increase adoption and procurement, and the United States should expand its investments in commercially oriented robotics research and development (R&D).[9] Further, president Trump should issue an annual award at the White House to firms that have done the best job of installing robots, and use his bully pulpit to shame other executives who have gone capital-light and failed to invest in automation.[10]

1. b. What are the primary challenges and barriers that need to be addressed to ensure the successful integration and widespread adoption of emerging technology in manufacturing?

A litany of supply and demand challenges continue to inhibit the wider adoption of emerging technologies in U.S. manufacturing. One challenge is that the technologies are still evolving and not yet fully mature. As Industry Week’s Jessica Davis notes, “Implementing an Internet of Things program isn’t exactly like flipping a switch. There’s a lot involved, from sensors where the data is initially collected to the network the data travels, to the analytics systems that figure out what it all means.”[11] A lack of interoperable standards between vendor solutions represents another significant challenge. As the report “Industrie 4.0 in a Global Context: Strategies for Cooperating with International Partners” explains, “individual modules, components, devices, production lines, robots, machines, sensors, catalogues, directories, systems, databases, and applications will need common standards for the connections among them and for the overall semantics, or how data gets seamlessly passed from one device to another.”[12] Thus, standardization of architectures, data-exchange formats, vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies, and interfaces will be key to creating interoperability between different digital manufacturing solutions, and the U.S. National Institute of Standards (NIST) can play an important role in facilitating this.

Recent research from the Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey has found that 70 percent of digital transformation initiatives fail to meet their objectives.[13] A significant reason why pertains to lagging employee skills and competencies to effectively implement digital solutions and to a lack of clarity regarding the value proposition behind digital implementations. This is why many countries inventory and describe discrete, specific manufacturing digitalization use cases and processes. For example, Germany has documented over 300 specific use cases/sample instantiations of SME manufacturing digitalization.[14] Further, as the subsequent section on small manufacturers will document, they often lack the capital to invest in modernized plant and equipment.

A second challenge is that too many U.S. companies seek to go “asset light,” limiting investment in capital assets to make their balance sheets more favorable to investors. It is beyond the scope of this submission to address this issue, but a task force led by Treasury and including other major financial agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and banking regulators, should seek solutions to this.

2. a. Which disruptive manufacturing technologies (e.g., additive, nanotechnology, biotechnology) hold the potential to eliminate reliance on foreign sources for critical minerals and materials, and how will they do that?

b. What are the technical challenges and barriers associated with implementing these technologies at an industrial scale, and how can they be addressed?

The United States must make it a national imperative to decrease dependence on China for key critical minerals. For instance, for rare earths used in magnets—notably neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium—China accounted for about 60 percent of their global mining and 90 percent of their refining and processing in 2024.[15] Overall, China accounts for around 60 percent of the global supply of battery-grade lithium, 65 percent of nickel, 70 percent of cobalt, and 90 percent of rare-earth elements such as neodymium.[16] China is also the primary global supplier for many key active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). For instance, approximately 70 percent of the world’s paracetamol (acetaminophen) originates from Chinese firms and over 80 percent of key antibiotic actives (e.g., doxycycline and amoxicillin) are produced in China.[17]

The only way the United States can restore its capacities in critical mineral/rare earths processing and refining in a manner that’s cost-competitive with Chinese production while still being environmentally friendly is through innovation. This will require novel, innovative, new-to-the-world refining processes to address China’s lead in this field. This will require ample R&D funding from both the public and private sectors and also the funding of Ph.D. researchers to develop these new processes. As such, the United States should establish a new National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center (ERC) for critical minerals refining and processing.

4. a. What are examples of U.S. manufacturing-related technological, market, or business challenges that may best be addressed by public-private partnerships and are likely to attract both participation and primary funding from industry?

b. How can public-private partnerships be structured to overcome potential hurdles and foster successful collaboration?

The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft represents Europe’s largest application-oriented research organization, comprised of 67 institutes. One of the historically great strengths of Germany’s Fraunhofer system is that it brings German industry and academia together in a structured manner to develop new technologies with specific industrial relevance.[18] Each Fraunhofer is co-led by a representative from industry and academia. The Fraunhofers work with specific German industrial sectors to develop 10-year technology roadmaps for industry, identifying specific technical hurdles or challenges that need to be addressed, and then through the associated universities they fund Ph.D.s to solve those technological problems and then diffuse that knowledge back throughout Germany’s industrial ecosystem. The German government at the federal and state levels co-invest in the effort, covering about 30 percent of program costs.

America’s Manufacturing USA network is somewhat modeled after this approach. But what it really points to is that the United States should be developing manufacturing-sector-specific competitiveness and innovation strategies. The semiconductor industry has long done this well, and even now the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) has articulated a Decadal Plan for Semiconductors, which has defined specific research challenges such as energy management, storage density, security-on-chip, etc.[19] Similarly, ITIF has called for the Trump administration to encourage the creation of the biopharma equivalent of the SRC.[20] Here, industry could collaborate on such a production technology innovation roadmap, and the federal government could match their funding to research institutes and universities on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For example, some life-sciences firms have their own roadmaps (e.g., GlaxoSmithKline’s manufacturing technology roadmap is focused on the use of continuous techniques).[21]

Beyond biotechnology and semiconductors, the United States should be developing similar decadal competitiveness strategies/technology roadmaps for key manufacturing industries including aerospace, automotive, chemicals, robotics, machine tools, shipbuilding, etc. The U.S. government should be a partner with American academia and industry in helping develop these strategies, but unfortunately it lacks not just the resources but also the key data to undertake the analytics necessary. For this reason, ITIF has laid out a comprehensive assessment of what are the federal statistical needs that would underpin a comprehensive “National Advanced Industry and Technology Strategy.”[22]

Ensuring that small manufacturers can tap into the technological expertise being developed by the Manufacturing USA Institutes is important. A following section discussed improving Manufacturing USA/Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) coordination. While each of the Manufacturing USA Institutes have different business models/value propositions, some have created unique pathways for SMEs to engage with them, such as how MxD (focused on digital manufacturing) offered $500 subscriptions for a low-tier set of outputs. Each Manufacturing USA Institute should have an SME engagement strategy.

5. a. How can Federal agencies and federally funded R&D centers supporting advanced manufacturing R&D facilitate the transfer of research results, intellectual property, and technology scale-up into commercialization and manufacturing.

5.b. What are the key challenges in translating research findings into commercially viable manufacturing processes and products, and how can they be overcome?

First and foremost, America needs to adopt and maintain a supportive, and non-disruptive, approach to the effective technology and intellectual property (IP) transfer system the United States has already developed, and to the extent it reforms this approach it should focus on value-adding improvements on the margins. The administration should also recognize that the process of IP/technology commercialization is already risky, difficult, expensive, and fraught with many valleys of death.

The Trump administration should further recognize that the United States has already built the world’s most effective system for technology commercialization, especially when it pertains to IP/technologies derived from federally funded R&D conducted at U.S. universities and research institutions. However, as late as 1978, the federal government had licensed less than 5 percent of the as many as 30,000 patents it owned.[23] Most of them languished on the shelves of government offices or labs. Congress transformed the situation by passing the bipartisan 1980 Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, better known as the “Bayh-Dole Act.” The legislation both created a uniform patent policy among the many federal agencies funding research and allowed universities to retain ownership of the IP and inventions made as a result of federally funded research.[24] The Bayh-Dole Act has transformed U.S. universities into engines of innovation, spawning robust academic technology transfer and commercialization capabilities and activities at hundreds of universities across the United States that have led to the launch of over 18,000 start-up companies.[25]

The Trump administration should focus first on preserving the effective operation of the Bayh-Dole framework. When Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act it included so-called “march-in right” provisions, which permit the government, in specified circumstances, to require patent holders to grant a “nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license” to a “responsible applicant or applicants.”[26]

The Bayh-Dole Act specifies only four instances in which the government is permitted to exercise march-in rights, and reasonable prices isn’t one. Yet some have called for the government to use Bayh-Dole march-in rights to control the price of resulting products, such as pharmaceutical drugs. This despite the fact that lower prices are not one of the rationales laid out in the Bayh-Dole Act. In fact, as senators Bayh and Dole have themselves noted, the Bayh-Dole Act’s march-in rights were never intended to control or ensure “reasonable prices.”[27] As the senators wrote in a 2002 Washington Post op-ed titled, “Our Law Helps Patients Get New Drugs Sooner,” the Bayh-Dole Act: “Did not intend that government set prices on resulting products. The law makes no reference to a reasonable price that should be dictated by the government. This omission was intentional.”[28]

The Trump administration should return to an initiative undertaken in its first iteration, when it had directed NIST to undertake a review of federal policies that could bolster the return of federal investments in R&D. The final 2018 report NIST produced, the “Return on Investment Initiative: Draft Green Paper,” concluded, “The use of march-in is typically regarded as a last resort, and has never been exercised since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980.”[29] The report further noted, “NIH determined that that use of march-in to control drug prices was not within the scope and intent of the authority.”[30] The Trump administration should build upon the findings of the 2018 NIST Green Paper and affirmatively declare that price is not a legitimate basis for the exercise of Bayh-Dole march-in rights.

As ITIF has argued, the biggest difficulty for Bayh-Dole licensees to manufacture in the United States has been the evisceration of America’s manufacturing base has denuded their ability to find manufacturing options in the United States—and so the best way to deal with this challenge is by thoroughly revitalizing American manufacturing, as this RFI helps seek to accomplish. The legislation does include some useful proposals, including directing NIST to identify and maintain a database of domestic manufacturers that commercialize products and services developed from federally funded research. The bill would also require NIST to report to Congress on the commercialization of federal research by domestic manufacturers within 18 months (of the bill’s passage).[31] One improvement ITIF has called for the legislation to make (and for NIST to implement) is for the U.S. government to develop a similar database of manufacturers in key allied nations; which could make it easier for licensees to identify alternative-to-China manufacturers when options are unavailable in the United States.

As noted, a significant strength of the U.S. innovation system is that it has turned America’s universities into engines of innovation, thanks in large part to the Bayh-Dole Act. In fact, the impact of academic technology transfer from U.S. universities has been so extensive that, from 1996 to 2020, it resulted in 554,000 inventions disclosed, 141,000 U.S. patents granted, and 18,000 start-ups formed.[32] Moreover, academic technology transfer has bolstered U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by up to $1 trillion, contributed to $1.9 trillion in gross U.S. industrial output, and supported 6.5 million jobs over that time.[33]

In September 2025, in an Axios interview, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called for the federal government to claim half the patent earnings from university inventions derived in part from federal R&D, erroneously asserting that “the U.S. government is getting no return on the money it invests in federal research.”[34] Yet the reality is the U.S. taxpayer—and the government—benefits greatly from this R&D funding. They benefit first from the extensive innovations produced from the academic tech transfer process, which alone has produced hundreds of life-saving drugs and vaccines, including treatments for breast, ovarian, prostate, and skin cancer, not to mention other breakthroughs in everything from Honeycrisp apples and neoprene to cloud and quantum computing. Second, university IP licensing revenues help fund key innovation-enabling infrastructure at U.S. universities, such as labs, incubators, or innovation accelerators that keep the innovation flywheel churning. Third, the government benefits from the taxes produced by the trillions in industrial output and millions of jobs created as a result of university tech transfer.[35] For instance, university research parks alone generated $33 billion in federal tax revenue in 2024.[36] The administration should refrain from imposing a claim or a tax on IP licensing revenues earned by U.S. universities.

6.a. What are the main challenges in attracting, training, and retraining a skilled workforce for advanced manufacturing, and how can they be addressed?

If the United States is to achieve its ambition to significantly revitalize American manufacturing, it needs to take further steps to ensure that it possesses the manufacturing workforce to support expanded U.S. manufacturing output. That’s especially the case as analysts expect the demand for tech talent to grow to 7.1 million tech jobs by 2034 in the United States, from an estimated six million in 2023.[37] Another report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) finds that, by the end of 2030, an estimated 3.85 million additional jobs requiring proficiency in technical fields will be created in the United States, but that, “Of those, 1.4 million jobs risk going unfilled unless we can expand the pipeline for such workers in fields such as skilled technicians, engineering, and computer science.”[38] For the semiconductor industry, the report estimates that roughly 67,000—or 58 percent of projected new jobs (and 80 percent of projected new technical jobs)—risk going unfilled at current degree completion rates.[39] The administration should lead in several efforts to enhance U.S. manufacturing workforce skilling, including:

Expand Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program funding. Skilled technicians are a key component of the traded sector workforce. One highly successful program designed to build technician skills is NSF’s Advanced Technological Education program, which supports community colleges working in partnership with industry, economic development agencies, workforce investment boards, and secondary and other higher education institutions.[40] ATE projects and centers are educating technicians in a range of fields, including nanotechnologies and microtechnologies, rapid prototyping, biomanufacturing, logistics, and alternative fuel automobiles. Notwithstanding this, ATE funding is quite small, at approximately $74 million in FY 2025.[41] The Trump administration should work with Congress to double ATE funding to at least $150 million per year.

Expand the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP). The engineering curricula at too many American universities is overly academic as opposed to industry focused. Indeed, university engineering programs have evolved in two troubling directions over the past several decades. First, the focus on “engineering as a science” has increasingly moved university engineering education away from a focus on real problem solving toward more abstract engineering science. Second, this focus on “engineering as a science” has left university engineering departments more concerned with producing pure knowledge than working with industry to help them solve real problems.

That’s why ITIF has argued that the United States needs more “manufacturing universities,” which would revamp their engineering programs and focus much more on manufacturing engineering and in particular work that is more relevant to industry. This would include more joint industry-university research projects, more student training that incorporates manufacturing experiences through co-ops or other programs, and a Ph.D. education program focused on turning out more engineering graduates who work in industry. These universities would view Ph.D.s as akin to high-level apprenticeships (as they often are in Germany), where industry experience is required as part of the degree. Likewise, criteria for faculty tenure would consider professors’ work with and/or in industry as much as their number of scholarly publications. In addition, these universities’ business schools would integrate closely with engineering and focus on manufacturing issues, including management of production.

One model for these manufacturing universities is the Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts, which reimagined engineering education and curriculum to prepare students “to become exemplary engineering innovators who recognize needs, design solutions, and engage in creative enterprises for the good of the world.”[42]

Congress implemented a form of these proposals when it passed the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program into law in December 2016 as part of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), authorizing the Department of Defense to support industry-relevant, manufacturing-focused, engineering training at U.S. institutions of higher education, universities, industry, and not-for-profit institutions. With its $48 million in initial funding, MEEP made awards to 13 educational and industry partners to bring educational opportunities to Americans interested in learning manufacturing skills critical to sustaining the U.S. defense innovation base.[43] In 2023, MEEP issued additional three-year funding grants “that establish programs or enhance existing programs to better position the manufacturing workforce to produce military systems and components that assure technological superiority for DoD.”[44]

MEEP can be a powerful initiative, but it is underfunded and has become too solely focused on engineering in the national defense context. Therefore, the Administration should work with Congress to broaden the MEEP remit to refocus it more on supporting industry-relevant, applied engineering programs at leading universities. Congress should allocate $150 million annually to a revitalized MEEP program that would make grants to 20 engineering programs at leading U.S. universities to redirect them toward more hands-on, industrially relevant engineering activities.

6.b. How can Federal agencies and federally funded R&D centers develop, align, and strengthen all levels of advanced manufacturing training, certification, registered apprenticeships, and credentialing programs.

Each Manufacturing USA Institute should develop workforce training workstreams associated with their focal technology area. For instance, MxD’s “Digital Manufacturing and Design Roles Taxonomy” identified 165 distinct digital manufacturing and design roles, describing the responsibilities of each of those roles and the skills individuals needed to accrue to fulfill them.[45] Beyond identifying new roles and occupations, each of the Manufacturing USA Institutes should work with their affiliated academic partners to build and deliver educational curricula for these positions.

The National Skill Standards Act of 1994 created a National Skill Standards Board (NSSB) responsible for supporting voluntary partnerships in each economic sector that would establish industry-defined national standards leading to industry-recognized, nationally portable certifications. But this vision has yet to be fulfilled. Therefore, Congress and the Administration should work to increase credentialing for the manufacturing and the closely related logistics industry workforce members by expanding the use of standards-based, nationally portable, industry-recognized certifications specifically designed for specific manufacturing and logistics sectors.[46]

The United States significantly underinvests in workforce training programs, dedicating just 0.1 percent of GDP in active labor market programs compared with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 0.6 percent of GDP, meaning America’s OECD peers such as Austria and Germany invest six or more times more in their workforce training and support programs.[47] Moreover, the United States now invests less than half of what it did in such programs 30 years ago, as a share of GDP.[48]

One way the Trump administration and Congress could address this challenge would be by expanding Section 127 tax benefits for employer-provided tuition assistance. Section 127 of the federal tax code allows employers to provide employees up to $5,250 per year in tuition assistance; the employer deducts the cost of the benefit but the employee doesn’t have to report it as income.[49] Congress should increase Section 127 to at least $8,700 (per the rate of inflation since 1996) and index the amount to the annual rate of inflation going forward.[50]

7. a. In what ways can the federal government assist in the development of advanced manufacturing clusters and technology hubs nationwide, beyond funding needs?

b. Is there a need for new or expanded advanced manufacturing clusters or technology hubs for the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers, and if so, in what sectors or technologies?

c. Should Federal incentives prioritize industry-specific advanced manufacturing clusters or instead focus on technology hubs centered on advanced technologies, critical components, and materials? If so, why?

In a 2019 report, “The Case for Growth Centers” ITIF examined where innovation jobs are found in the U.S. economy, defining these as jobs that in industries that have a specified level of R&D intensity and that employ a certain share of STEM workers. ITIF found that fully one-third of U.S. innovation jobs are concentrated in just 14 U.S. counties, and one-half in 40 counties.[51] This insight was part of the inspiration behind Congressional creation of the Economic Development Adminsitration’s (EDA) Regional Tech Hubs program. EDA has designated 31 Tech Hubs and in July 2024 released $504 million in Implementation awards for 12 of the 31 designated Tech Hubs.[52]

Besides Congress not appropriating enough money, the program was poorly implemented. The Biden administration allowed NSF and the Department of Commerce (along with the Department of War and the Small Business Administration) to develop their own regional hub programs with no coordination, essentially spreading limited reasou4ces far too wide and thin. Moreover, many of the EDA awards are weak and likely to never become self-sufficient hubs once federal funding ends. The Trump administration should redo the competition, but this time fund fewer centers, make NSF and EDA develop a joint program, and ensure that winners could be self-sufficient and targeted on what ITIF calls “national power” industries (as subsequently explained).

9a. What are the biggest obstacles faced by small and medium-sized manufacturing companies in adopting advanced technologies to increase efficiency and productivity?

SMEs lag in adopting new technologies that would make them more productive, especially with regard to incorporating digital technologies.[53] SME manufacturers often lack the knowhow to implement advanced technologies or are uncertain about the value proposition behind doing so. As noted previously, this is why it’s important to describe discrete, specific manufacturing digitalization use cases and processes and to provide benchmark assessment tools so SMEs can understand where they are in their digital manufacturing journey. Another significant challenge pertains to the lack of digital workforce skills to implement digital manufacturing solutions.

SMEs often lack the capital to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies. This challenge is amplified by pressure from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to cut costs, which further limits their ability to invest in modernized capital equipment. In fact, studies estimate that the inability of small firms to invest in equipment and plant upgrades contributes to a stark 40 percent productivity gap with large manufacturers.[54] SMEs often lack the available capital to invest in modernized plant and equipment; for instance, McKinsey research found that fully one-quarter of SMEs in the mid-Atlantic region lack the capital even to meet their weekly working-capital needs.[55] The OECD finds that access to capital has generally been tighter for SMEs in the United States than in other OECD countries ever since the Great Recession.[56]

Regarding this challenge, federal capital support (such as through upfront grants or repayable loans) could help them meet upfront investment costs (with the upgraded equipment delivering significant return on investment subsequently). This was the insight behind Congress allocating $50 million to the Department of Energy’s Office of Manufacturing and Supply Chain Resilience (MSRC) to be distributed to states for smart manufacturing pilot implementation programs.

In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed bipartisan Congressional legislation in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, which, among other initiatives, launched the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program. Congress originally envisioned the program—which is managed by the Department of Commerce’s NIST and which operates in all 50 U.S. states as well as Puerto Rico—as delivering expertise on quality manufacturing practices to America’s SMEs, but since then the remit of the program has broadened to be about enhancing the productivity and technological performance of U.S. manufacturing. The MEP network consists of approximately 475 service locations across its 51 centers. NIST asserts that, in FY 2024, the MEP National Network helped manufacturers achieve $15 billion in new and retained sales, $5 billion in new client investments, $2.6 billion in cost savings and over 108,000 jobs created or retained.[57] Since 2000, the MEP National Network has worked with 77,409 manufacturers, leading to $60 billion in new sales and $26.2 billion in cost savings, and has helped create and retain 1,456,889 jobs, according to NIST.[58] Elsewhere, a report from Summit Consulting and the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research found that the program generated a financial return of more than 17:1 on the $175 million in federal funds it received in fiscal year 2023.[59]

Unfortunately, the MEP program has been targeted for zeroing-out since the first Trump administration and was one of the programs designated for elimination in the Project 2025 initiative.[60] Yet the MEP program plays an important role in America’s SME manufacturer support ecosystem, and while it may merit significant reforms, the program should not be wholesale terminated.

When MEP was established in 1982, it made sense to have a network of state-focused centers working with manufacturers in each state. But a state-by-state focus presents difficulties when modern manufacturing challenges are increasingly horizontal in nature—e.g., artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, manufacturing digitalization, supply chain integration, etc.—and it makes less sense for each MEP center to develop its own capabilities in these areas independently. MEP should develop a centralized “Center of Excellence” to develop education/training/implementation modules regarding these cross-cutting manufacturing challenges and distribute them through the regional MEP delivery system.

Here, it’s imperative that the MEP program works closely with the Manufacturing USA network. America’s 18 Institutes of Manufacturing Innovation—spanning manufacturing domains from bio-manufacturing, digital/automation, electronics, and energy/environment to materials—should be viewed as “the tip of the spear” for developing advanced manufacturing product and process technologies in the United States. But MEP should be the channel through which these novel manufacturing product/process technologies get diffused to America’s SME manufacturer base. As such, each Manufacturing USA Institute should have an ongoing MEP “embedded representative” attached to it, with a mandate to develop a strategy for diffusing technologies being developed out of the Institutes across the MEP network.

Another avenue of MEP reform should be recognizing that, because supply chains cross state boundaries, MEP needs many more cross-state, sector-based MEP initiatives (e.g., autos in the U.S. Midwest and South, semiconductors in the Southwest). In other words, MEP should take on more of a supply-chain and sector-based focus. One can envision other regional/sectoral MEPs focused on wood/paper products in the Northwest, semiconductors in the Southwest, medical devices in the upper Midwest, maritime/shipbuilding in the Northeast, defense manufacturing in California or Texas, etc. If MEP departs from a predominantly state-based delivery model, it should reorient its approach to a regional/industrial delivery of SME services with a greater supply chain orientation.

A significant challenge for the MEP program has been that MEP centers often undertake small projects (average project size is about $15,000), so the engagements often don’t prove truly transformative for the customer (in part because MEP engagements often aren’t at the CEO level), and tend to engage line managers or a business unit. MEP needs to focus on transformation projects with customers, something it could better accomplish if it had longer-term, more stable funding that permitted centers to hire and retain more sophisticated staff that can build longer-term expertise.

Another way to strengthen MEP would be to emphasize assignments not just with the SME, but also their OEM customers, such as by defining joint grants (matched by the larger firm) for customers and suppliers that apply together. The larger firm’s support would demonstrate that it is committed to these suppliers and believes these suppliers are viable and strategic. It would also ease a key problem that small firms face: providing them with crucial demand-side certainty would greatly reduce the danger they face in making investments in new products or processes since they don’t have the profits to place bets that might not pay off.

For instance, ITIF has long argued the United States needs to introduce mechanisms to encourage OEMs to take more ownership of manufacturing supply chain digitalization. Large U.S. manufacturers have tended to keep their suppliers at arm’s length, too often treating them on a transactional basis with cost as the principal concern. But as the McKinsey Global Institute notes, “this approach can affect the bottom line. One McKinsey study found that inefficiencies in OEM-supplier interactions add up to roughly 5 percent of development, tooling, and product costs in the auto industry.”[61] Put simply, U.S. OEMs need to take more ownership for driving digital transformation within their supply chains. To this end, ITIF has previously argued that the U.S. government should provide incentives for U.S. OEMs to help 10,000 SMEs to become smart-manufacturing enabled within 10 years.[62]

Another potential OEM-SME partnership opportunity pertains to accumulating shared data that could help AI-based systems such as digital twins operate more effectively. Manufacturing generates more data than any other sector of the economy, yet few companies are harnessing it.[63] Yet AI systems become more effective when they have more data to train on, such as if they have data about the operating performance of production equipment or machine tools that they can learn from to predict failure modes in advance (i.e., predictive maintenance). Many companies own similar or the same machines or tools, yet the data is siloed internally and others can’t learn from it. NIST could lead a voluntary initiative where companies would share anonymized data into a shared data lake that could create new data sets against which novel AI algorithms could be developed.

10. What are examples of public-private partnership models (at the international, national, state, and/or local level) that could be expanded to facilitate manufacturing technology development, technology transition to market, and workforce development?

Two programs are here worth highlighting and targeting for expansion. The Trump administration should work with Congress to expand manufacturing-focused Engineering Research Center (ERC) programs. The U.S. National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Engineering Research Center program supports a network of 17 strategic university-industry partnerships that pursue high-risk, high-payoff research across almost the entire spectrum of technology fields—including advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, clean energy and sustainability, microelectronics and information technology.[64] Since 1985, NSF has funded 83 ERCs that have led to more than 1,400 invention licenses, 920 patents, and 250 spinoff companies.[65]

Unfortunately, NSF currently only supports three ERCs explicitly focused on advanced manufacturing activities: the NSF ERC for Cell Manufacturing Technologies (CMaT), the NSF ERC for Hybrid Autonomous Manufacturing Moving from Evolution to Revolution (ERC-HAMMER), and the NSF Engineering Research Center for Transformation of American Rubber through Domestic Innovation for Supply Security (NSF TARDISS ERC).[66] In August 2024, NSF announced a five-year investment of $104 million, with a potential 10-year investment of up to $208 million, in four new ERCs, including a new one focused on biomanufacturing-empowered decarbonization.[67] This represents progress, but it’s not enough; the administration should work with Congress to ensure at least $150 million in annual funding for the NSF ERC program, supporting both existing and new manufacturing-focused ERCs. Further, the ERCs should be required to have their federal funding matched at least half by industry in cash.

NSF should have more of its budget allocated to its Technology, Innovation, and Partnership (TIP) program, which focuses on translating use-inspired research into societal impact. An essential aspect of the TIP program is that it requires every project it funds to have an industry partner. Despite minimal appropriated resources, in just two years TIP has launched regional innovation programs, funded workforce development, improved U.S. competitiveness in two key technologies, and established partnerships with federal agencies and allies like India and Japan. Yet the program’s workforce has shrunk 45 percent since the start of the year due to cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency and a hiring freeze. The Trump administration should work with Congress to boost TIP appropriations to at least $1 billion annually.[68]

The Industry University Cooperative Research (IUCRC) program forges partnerships between universities and industry, featuring industrially relevant fundamental research, industrial support of and collaboration in research and education, and direct transfer of university-developed ideas, research results, and technology to U.S. industry to improve its competitive posture in global markets.[69] NSF currently operates nine IUCRCs focused on advanced manufacturing innovation, with the newest one, the Center for Integrated Material Science and Engineering of Pharmaceutical Products (CIMSEPP) launched in 2022.[70] As with the ERC program, the United States could get more out of the IUCRC program to support U.S. advanced manufacturing. The Trump administration should work with Congress to provide annual funding for the IUCRC program that supports at least 15 ongoing advanced-manufacturing focused IUCRCs.

Innovation vouchers can serve as effective instruments to bring small businesses closer to local universities to collaborate on proof of concept testing or technology development. For the past several years, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have provided technical assistance to the recipients of Department of Energy (DOE) -funded voucher programs, namely American-Made Challenges (AMC), the Incubator Program, and the Small Business Vouchers Program. This effort should be fully built out into a national program across the clean energy focused federal labs to drive strong relationships between entrepreneurs and the national labs to accelerate the roll-out of new technologies in U.S. clean energy sectors such as electric vehicle (EV) batteries and solar cells.[71]And, here, given that the United States is trailing so badly in EV battery technology to China, the Trump administration should launch such a “BatteryShot Initiative” with the goal of producing a battery with a total system cost of less than $200/kWh and a range of at least 1,000 miles per charge.[72]

11. The current 2022–2026 National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing has three top-level goals, each with objectives and priorities: (1) Develop and implement advanced manufacturing technologies; (2) Grow the advanced manufacturing workforce; and (3) Build resilience into manufacturing supply chains and ecosystems.

11a. Are these goals appropriate for the next 4–5 years? Why or why not?

These are appropriate starting goals, but the foremost goal of the National Advanced Manufacturing Strategy over the upcoming five-year period should be documented improvements in the health of what ITIF calls America’s “national power” industries.

The stark reality is that the kind of reforms and adjustments proposed above will help, but we shouldn’t fool ourselves that they will stop China from dominating advanced manufacturing. To stop that America needs much more and that will cost money and political capital. Congress needs to at least triple the R&D tax credit, something from which manufacturers are the principal beneficiary. We need a new and large source of patient capital to allow manufacturers to invest in machinery. We need to block Chinese imports of advanced manufacturing goods when they are unfairly produced and traded. We need the DOW to significantly expand its efforts beyond defense firms per se to a broad array of dual use firms and industries.

In short, U.S. manufacturing strategy should concern itself not with non-strategic industries (i.e., baseball gloves and ballpoint pens) but on enabling industries, dual-use industries, and defense industries, which collectively constitute national power industries.[73] (See figure 1.)

At one end of the continuum are defense industries. Clearly industries such as ammunition, guided missiles, military aircraft and ships, tanks, drones, defense satellites, and others are strategic. Not having world class innovation and production capabilities in these industries means a weakened military capability. Policymakers across the aisle generally agree that these industries are strategic and that market forces alone will not produce the needed results.

At the other end of the spectrum are industries in which the United States has no real strategic interests. These include furniture, coffee and tea manufacturing, bicycles, carpet and rug mills, window and door production, plastic bottle manufacturing, wind turbine production, lawn and garden equipment, sporting goods, jewelry, caskets, toys, toiletries, running shoes, etc. If worst came to worst and our adversaries (e.g., China) gained dominance in any of these industries and decided to cut America off, America would survive—in part, because none of these are critical to the running of the U.S. economy, as many are final goods that might inconvenience consumers but wouldn’t cripple any industries, and also because, in most cases, domestic production could be started or expanded relatively easily because none of these products are all that technological complex from either a product or process concern and the barriers to entry are relatively low.

Next to defense industries dual-use industries are critical to American strength. Losing aerospace, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, semiconductors, displays, advanced software, fiber optic cable, telecom equipment, machine tools, motors, measuring devices, and other dual-use sectors would give our adversaries incredible leverage over America. Just the threat to cut these off (assuming that they have also deindustrialized our allies in these sectors) would immediately bring U.S. policymakers to the bargaining table. National power industries tend to also need global scale in order to complete. Moreover, many are intermediate goods such as semiconductors and chemicals, where a cutoff would cripple many other industries. Finally, these industries are hard to stand up once they’re lost because of the complexity of the production process, product knowledge, and the importance of the industrial commons that support them. In other words, barriers to entry are high and, if lost, would be very difficult and expensive to reconstitute.

Finally, there are enabling industries. These are industries wherein, if the United States were cut off, the immediate effects on military readiness would be small. And the U.S. economy could survive for at least a while without production. America could survive for many years without an auto sector, as we would all just drive cars longer. But because of the nature of these industries—including technology development, process innovation, skills, and supporting institutions—their loss would harm both dual-use and defense industries. That is because enabling industries contribute to the industrial commons that support dual-use defense industries. A severely weakened motor vehicle sector would weaken the tank and military vehicle ecosystem. Similarly, a weakened commercial shipbuilding sector has weakened military shipbuilding. A weakened consumer electronics sector weakens military electronics.

The industries that ITIF defines as national power industries represent about 22 percent of the total 970 industries delineated by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Of these 22 percent, 13 percent are dual-use industries, 8 percent are enabling, and just 0.5 percent are defense industries. (See figure 2.) In terms of employment, just 9.5 percent of workers were employed in power industries, with 6.4 percent employed in dual-use industries, 2.9 percent in enabling industries, and the remaining 0.2 percent employed in defense industries.[74]

An analysis of several quantitative indicators of manufacturing inputs and outputs indicates that dual-use and enabling manufacturing industries have declined more than nonstrategic and defense industries over the past several years, from 2007 to 2022.

Dual-use and enabling industries have seen the steepest declines in employment among the four classifications, with declines of 17 percent and 19 percent, respectively, compared to a 10 percent decline in nonstrategic and defense industries. Additionally, capital investment in productivity-enhancing capital, such as machinery and equipment, fell by 34 percent in enabling industries, while dual-use industries saw no change, and nonstrategic and defense industries increased investment by 7 percent and 32 percent, respectively.[75]

Nominal value added grew across all classifications, yet growth was weakest among the core manufacturing base of enabling and dual-use industries. Nonstrategic industries saw the highest growth of 26 percent, followed by defense industries (16 percent), then enabling and dual-use industries, which grew by just 11 percent and 4 percent, respectively.[76] When considering inflation, which has grown approximately 41 percent economy-wide, value added in enabling and dual-use industries declined significantly.[77]

The decline in enabling and dual-use industry output indicates a hollowing out of the U.S. industrial base, and the consequences of this are severe. These industries are most critical to U.S. national security and support domestic supply chains and national power, and they are losing ground to international competitors, namely China. China has followed a predictable playbook across industry after industry, with significant state financial backing, forced technology transfer, and IP theft, leaving American firms unable to compete and contributing to the decline of U.S. advanced manufacturing. To combat this decline and push back against Chinese economic mercantilism, the United States must implement a national power industry strategy in which the most critical industries for national power are prioritized in policymaking. As noted previously, the first step in achieving this is the crafting of industry-specific strategies.[78]

While general industrial support, such as R&D credits and full expensing for capital equipment, are valuable tools in industrial development, their impacts are limited. All national power industries differ in their structure, key players, competitive forces, and technological needs, meaning each requires curated, individualized strategic support to help firms in the United States compete in global markets. Critical industries should be highlighted and strategies developed, including a national semiconductor strategy, a national aerospace strategy, a national robotics strategy, and more. Creating these strategies will require in-depth industry research, identifying unique strengths and weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in each industry, and analyzing how federal, state, and local policy support will impact global power and competitiveness.[79]

Conclusion

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation commends the Trump administration for working to develop an up-to-date, coherent National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing. The success of this effort will be vital to enhancing the global competitiveness of U.S. advanced manufacturing over the coming decade.

Thank you for your consideration.

By Ruth Liao, Liam Vaughan, and Jim Wyss

For 20 minutes, Wes Edens barely pauses as he talks about the sunny prospects for his beleaguered liquefied natural gas company, New Fortress Energy. Dressed in an open-collar blue shirt, his once-blond hair down to his neck, the effervescent 64-year-old billionaire from Montana appears relaxed, flicking through a printout of a PowerPoint presentation he says he prepared himself. It outlines NFE’s operations in Brazil, Mexico and Nicaragua, as well as the global growth potential of liquefied natural gas, or LNG.

It’s a cloudless November morning in Puerto Rico, where NFE supplies more than a third of the island’s natural gas and operates a handful of power plants. Edens, who made his fortune in private equity and co-owns both the Premier League team Aston Villa and the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks, has invited Bloomberg Businessweek to his company’s facility at the Port of San Juan to explain why, in spite of evidence to the contrary, NFE’s future is bright. “This is an amazing constellation of assets,” he says, waving the presentation. “We’ve invested $7 billion, millions of hours. But public markets aren’t always the most patient.”

Seven years ago, when NFE listed on the Nasdaq, it promised to shake up the staid market for LNG, a cheaper, cleaner alternative to the oil and diesel that are still in widespread use to generate electricity in poorer countries. LNG is made by cooling natural gas to -260F (-162C), which compresses it to a 600th of its original volume. Edens and his colleagues had come up with a new method for building the hulking terminals where the liquefaction and export take place, which they pledged would be quicker and cheaper than how everyone else did it. They gave their process the snappy moniker “Fast LNG.” Investors and lenders lapped it up, pouring billions of dollars into the business. By 2022, NFE had a market cap of $9.5 billion.

Since then the stock price has plummeted from $60 to around $1 as the company has lurched from one problem to the next. The first Fast LNG export site, off the coast of Altamira, Mexico, was beset by construction issues, leading to long delays and ballooning costs. It’s now operational, but last year investors sued NFE and its executives for allegedly misleading them over how much progress they were making, claims the defendants have denied. The case is ongoing.

Meanwhile, NFE’s Nicaragua import terminal, which was originally scheduled for completion in 2021, has yet to be switched on; the company just sold its facility in Jamaica to pay down debt; one of its new import facilities in Brazil doesn’t have any customers lined up; and in Puerto Rico, even after securing a new deal to supply the island with LNG, Edens is still scrambling to patch up his relationship with the government.

In Edens’ telling, the difficult part—building the export and import terminals and power plants underpinning NFE’s business—is largely complete, paving the way for cash to finally start flooding in. He acknowledges it all took longer and cost more than anticipated, but he says the market is seriously undervaluing the company. Edens attributes many of NFE’s difficulties to the decision to go public too early, leading to unnecessary external pressure. Markets “often struggle to properly value projects until they’re turned on and generating revenue,” he says.

Some former employees (there’s no shortage: Two-thirds of NFE’s staff have left or been laid off in the past year), however, describe a company in perpetual crisis, run by a gifted salesman who’s proved more adept at attracting capital and winning contracts than at delivering on those commitments. Holders of NFE’s $9 billion of distressed debt are certainly running out of patience—some have taken to calling the company No F—ing Exit. With some NFE bonds currently trading at roughly 30¢ on the dollar, Edens is talking to creditors about the possibility of restructuring the company through a UK process known as a scheme of arrangement, which would involve converting some of the debt into equity and slashing the interest on what remains. That would allow NFE to continue as a going concern, though bondholders could decide they no longer want Edens at the helm. Another alternative would be declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy and selling off the assets.

“It’s a very important time for the company,” Edens says, before donning a hard hat and leading a tour of the facility. If he manages to turn NFE’s fortunes around, it will be up there with the Bucks’ 2021 NBA championship, its first in 50 years, in terms of professional achievements. If he doesn’t, it will go down as one of the biggest corporate failures in recent history.

Natural gas provides about a third of the world’s energy. ​​Once extracted from underground or beneath a seabed, the gas is delivered to consumers via high-pressure steel pipelines. But the pipe network doesn’t cover everywhere, and there are limits to how far the fuel can be pumped. Liquefying it allows it to be transported on massive ships equipped with specially built cryogenic tanks. The US is the world’s largest LNG exporter (a result of the fracking and shale explosion of the 2000s), followed by Australia, Qatar and Russia. When it reaches its destination, LNG is heated up and brought back to a gaseous state—“regasified.” The gas is given an odor to make it detectable in case of leaks and pumped into the local transmission system.

The industry’s biggest challenge is building the facilities that convert gas into LNG. These vast export plants, which in the US dot the coast of Texas and Louisiana, are constructed by armies of specialist workers over a period of years and can cost tens of billions of dollars. The cooling takes place in what’s known as a cold box, which relies on a heat exchanger system not dissimilar to that found in a home’s HVAC unit, at thousands of times the size. Once liquefied, the fuel is stored in tanks as tall as a 15-story building at a constant -260F, requiring around-the-clock monitoring. Shutdowns and accidents aren’t uncommon; many facilities have their own fire department. All this helps explain why the market has traditionally been dominated by nation-states and oil majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Shell Plc. Companies that build LNG plants tend to sell the fuel via generationally long contracts—as long as 20 years—to persuade financiers to commit the capital required. Barriers to entry, in economics parlance, are high.

The idea for NFE struck Edens after Fortress Investment Group LLC, the private equity firm he co-founded, bought a train line in Florida in 2007. (The current iteration of the train, which runs between Orlando and Miami, is called Brightline.) When the firm settled on LNG as the train’s fuel source—briefly; it now runs on biodiesel—he saw the potential for a new business. “We’ve had lots of success in managing money, making investments,” Edens says. “I wanted to do something that had a meaningful and tangible impact on the world.”

NFE built a micro liquefaction facility in 2015 and the next year started exporting surplus fuel not used by the railway to Caribbean markets. Then it built import terminals—where LNG is heated and turned back into gas—in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Jamaica, and also acquired an existing facility in Brazil. It hired traders in London to buy cargoes of LNG in the market and leased tankers to ship it. LNG tankers can be almost a thousand feet long, and shipments are typically worth tens of millions of dollars. In the early stages of the war in Ukraine, when Europe was looking to rapidly replace Russian natural gas, a shipment could fetch as much as $100 million.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, when demand plummeted for energy of all kinds, NFE announced an investment in a green hydrogen business. Later the company pivoted to data centers. Edens can be demanding and mercurial, say former NFE employees, who requested anonymity owing to the company’s difficulties. They recount executives being dispatched at short notice to Sri Lanka, Mauritania and Ireland to win business, then berated when nothing came of it. One former executive recalls dreading being summoned to the boss’s Manhattan office—a situation not helped by the large painting of a wolf devouring its prey hanging on the wall.

“The media loves to elevate the voices of former employees,” Edens wrote in an email response to questions. “But those who quit and walked away should not drive the narrative or define our story.”

It was during the pandemic that Edens and his team struck upon the Fast LNG concept that would propel NFE to the status of investor darling. At the time, a large majority of LNG terminals were based on land, but some forward-looking companies had started putting them offshore, on huge vessels, removing the hassle and cost of acquiring real estate. NFE proposed to slot liquefaction terminals onto disused oil rigs, which could be picked up for next to nothing. Terminals would be identical, essentially interchangeable; cost efficiencies would follow.

Some in the LNG world were skeptical. Edens insisted Fast LNG would change the industry and made it the company’s primary focus, saying he hoped to get the first facility operational by 2022. The plan was to locate the maiden plant off the coast of Louisiana. When no permit was forthcoming after a year, Edens changed tack. In July 2022, NFE announced it had struck a deal with Mexico’s state utility to locate its first export facility off Altamira, with gas arriving through a 500-mile-long undersea pipeline from Texas. The terminal, spread over three separate rigs, would be built at a shipyard in Corpus Christi, Texas, then towed down the Gulf of Mexico.

In September, NFE issued a press release saying it hoped to complete the project by the next March. The plan was to follow that with four additional Fast LNG units in quick succession. “Utilizing a highly skilled workforce,” NFE had “developed an efficient and repeatable construction process—essentially an FLNG factory—that substantially reduces the cost and time to build incremental liquefaction capacity,” the company wrote. Two months later, NFE held an investor day at the shipyard, where two dozen or so finance types were given hard hats and shown around industrial-scale machinery by a long-haired engineer in coveralls. It was a hit, as was NFE’s announcement the same week that progress was so good the company was increasing its earnings guidance for 2023 to $2.5 billion, from $1.5 billion.

“We urge investors (who may have been waiting on the sidelines before) to take a serious look at NFE now because Fast LNG, we believe, is coming soon and the broader market doesn’t likely fully appreciate the potential upside,” one analyst wrote. Another said he’d come away from the site visit with “increased confidence” in NFE’s ability to meet its construction targets. He increased his target price for the stock by $10.

By the following week, NFE’s shares had risen 7%, almost to their historical peak. NFE then borrowed an additional $700 million and announced a bonus dividend worth $630 million. “Our business is now generating significant, stable, and growing cash, which we believe affords us the ability to both retain capital necessary to grow and return excess capital to shareholders,” Edens said in a December 2022 press release. As the biggest shareholders, he and his family received $217 million, more than the company’s profit for the previous year.

Behind the scenes, though, NFE was starting to flounder. Construction of the Altamira export terminal was taking longer and costing more than anticipated. (The final cost was about $3.5 billion, more than three times the original estimate.) NFE pushed the expected completion date from March to May 2023, then October, then early 2024. Similar delays were occurring at the import terminals in Nicaragua and Brazil. As for developments in Angola and Mauritania that were announced enthusiastically in press releases, they never got going.

Former executives say Edens had a habit of telling investors and prospective customers what they wanted to hear without consulting engineers and project managers on the ground. On earnings calls he’d talk about how he had “tremendous visibility,” and how his estimates of future income were “not really forward-looking” because they were based on “the business flows and the transactions that we have in hand.” Then, the following quarter, he’d move the goalposts, and the share price would tumble.

“There’s a saying we live by—it’s literally on our office wall: nothing exceptional comes from reasonable expectations,” Edens wrote in an email by way of explanation. “It’s simply a way to motivate others to suspend disbelief and get big things built.”

With pressure mounting, Edens and his team took the decision in the summer of 2023 to transport the Fast LNG plant from Corpus Christi to Altamira before it had undergone commissioning, the rigorous final testing of systems and equipment. NFE marked the milestone with a video showing a rig as tall as an office block, complete with living quarters and a helipad, being pulled across the ocean by five tugboats that looked minuscule by comparison. It was an arresting image, but commissioning on the water rather than onshore created logistical headaches and ended up adding to the delays. In February 2024, after another disappointing set of earnings, Edens pushed the timetable back once more. “While it’s been a little bit delayed,” he said on an earnings call, “it’s important to note that it still would be the fastest LNG installation in the history of the planet.”

Around midday on April 26, an aluminum pipe inside the cold box exploded during a pressure test. The site was evacuated, and several workers were hospitalized. Repairs dragged on. Finally the first LNG cargo ship set sail from Altamira on Aug. 12. It should have been a moment of celebration for Edens and his team. But earlier that week the company had put out a press release slashing its earnings guidance in half, leading NFE’s shares to fall 24%. There was more bad news to come.

On Sept. 17, 2024, investors filed the class-action lawsuit in New York, alleging that New Fortress and its executives intentionally and repeatedly misled the market about progress at Altamira and other locations, a form of securities fraud. The suit contrasted Edens’ and his executives’ upbeat public statements with a damning picture of what was happening on the ground, drawn from interviews with a dozen unnamed former NFE employees who’d worked on the project. Pipeworkers, project managers and engineers reported “endemic” delays, hazardous working conditions, “poor planning” and “chaotic” mismanagement. One described Edens’ decision to commission the facility on the water as “insane.”

The most shocking allegation related to the November 2022 investor day in Texas. According to the manager responsible for commissioning at the time, NFE had “pulled the main turbines from the manufacturer’s (Siemens) factory early—three months before they were done—just to make it look like Defendants were further along to attendees at the investor day presentation.” The whole event was “staged to create an illusion of progress,” the former manager said. (Edens denies this happened, describing the allegation as “ridiculous.”)

NFE rejected the allegations in the lawsuit, writing in a filing that Edens and his colleagues “expressly and continuously disclosed that its projected milestones were simply estimates.” (Corporate officials who make forward-looking statements in good faith are protected from prosecution by so-called safe harbor provisions.) NFE added that the Altamira facility was “successfully built and continues to drive value for the Company’s stockholders.” A motion by NFE’s lawyers to dismiss the case is being considered by the judge. “I’ve never sold a share!” adds Edens, refuting the suggestion that he profited from his overoptimism. As for the decision to pay a large dividend when most of the assets were unbuilt, he says that was consistent with his understanding of the business’s prospects at the time.

Earlier this month, after some to-ing and fro-ing, NFE announced it had secured a seven-year contract worth $3.2 billion to supply Puerto Rico with gas from Altamira. It was a welcome development but smaller than the 20-year deal originally mooted, and the news barely made a ripple in the markets. Next up, there’s the matter of finding long-term buyers for the power produced by the Brazilian terminal in Santa Catarina and getting Nicaragua operational. Both of those efforts, Edens says, are “nearly complete.” Soon, he says, gas will finally start flowing, along with NFE’s profits.

As for the plan to build more Fast LNG export terminals, that’s been shelved, at least for now. According to Edens, that’s a natural consequence of changes in market fundamentals: LNG prices are now so low that it’s just as cheap to buy cargoes in the markets as it is to produce it at export terminals like Altamira. Others see it as more of a capitulation. “The fact is that NFE’s ambition was not matched with technical and execution capabilities,” says Richard Pratt of the consulting firm Precision LNG. Pratt describes the whole Fast LNG concept as a “white elephant.”

If the business is to have any kind of future, Edens and his bankers must first reach an agreement with NFE’s various creditor groups. On Nov. 15 bondholders agreed to hold off receiving their latest interest payments for a month, buying Edens a little more time to build consensus around a restructuring plan and save the company. Adding to his stress, Brightline, the Florida train operation, is undergoing its own restructuring after failing to service its debts. Considering the stakes, Edens seems relaxed about it. “Obviously it’s not ideal, but this is a circumstance that many companies have been through before in one way or the other,” he says of NFE’s predicament. “There’s a tremendous amount of asset value. The company is literally on the 1-yard line.”

What's happening?

Reuters reported on a successful challenge to the European Union's 2035 ban on internal combustion engines led by German automakers and stakeholders. That campaign cited increased competition by Chinese EV automakers, like BYD, and U.S. tariffs as factors in the push.

""Next Tuesday, the European Commission will be putting forward a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines,"" declared Manfred Weber, a prominent EU politician, at a press conference in Heidelberg, Germany.

Instead of the 2035 ban, a new measure will tentatively set a target of 90% reduction in carbon pollution over automakers' fleets beginning in 2035. Weber defended the about-face by calling it a push for market-driven solutions and consumer choice in achieving climate targets.

At the press conference, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized EVs' importance to hitting decarbonization goals. He stated that those goals must be met while advocating for alternatives like synthetic fuels as part of ""technological openness.""

Why is Europe's backpedaling on EV adoption important?

This decision could slow progress toward a cleaner future, maintaining reliance on gas-powered vehicles that contribute significantly to carbon pollution. It also doesn't exist in a vacuum.

Moves in the U.S. led by the Trump administration are discouraging EV adoption. Those include the end of EV tax credits for consumers and, more recently, lowered targets for fuel efficiency for U.S. automakers' fleets.

Overall, the rate of EV adoption around the world is slowing down compared to just a few years ago. While lawmakers should take into account how domestic automakers are faring in the increasingly competitive landscape, they should also balance the environmental consequences.

The world is facing increasingly devastating weather events. There is more variability in the production of farming and other industries due to record-setting temperatures and unpredictable weather. It remains vital to assess how such decisions affect progress toward a sustainable future and a healthier environment.

What's being done about EV adoption in Europe?

In spite of this gloomy piece of news for EVs, it's necessary to look at the greater context. After all, a huge justification for the move is the assortment of competitive options that China is bringing to the market.

That's bad news for German auto brands trying to keep up. Consumers, however, benefit from the price pressure brought along by a competitive market. It's also clear that EVs are in demand in Europe with Tesla finding large success there and BYD overtaking them recently.

As long as European consumers continue to demand EVs, decarbonization will continue in the continent no matter the flip-flopping of politicians.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EV-adoptionimage-recnIg4xrzOctMfen.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:00:41.668442

Air Products is the project developer and once the ammonia plant has achieved agreed upon performance levels, Yara would acquire the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities for approximately 25% of the total project cost, which is estimated between $8 billion and $9 billion.

Yara would then assume responsibility for related operations and integrate the entire ammonia output into its global distribution network.

Air Products would own and operate the industrial gases production, where approximately 80% of the low-carbon hydrogen would be supplied to Yara under a 25-year long-term offtake agreement to produce 2.8 million tons of low-carbon ammonia per year.

The remaining hydrogen would be supplied to Air Products’ customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast via Air Products’ 700-mile hydrogen pipeline system. About five million tons per year of high purity CO₂ captured by the Air Products facility would be sequestered by a third party under a long-term agreement to be announced later.

Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.

The effort will also include the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia, which is more than 90% complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. Air Products is the sole offtaker of up to 1.2 million tons per year of renewable ammonia.

Air Products and Yara anticipate entering into a marketing and distribution agreement where Yara would commercialize, on a commission basis, the ammonia not sold by Air Products as renewable hydrogen in Europe.

“We are pleased to be working with Yara, the world’s leading fertilizer company, as we advance the global low-emission ammonia market and maximize value from our projects in Louisiana and Saudi Arabia,” said Air Products’ CEO Eduardo Menezes.",https://lvb.com/files/2025/12/1208-yara-image-with-air-products-and-yara-logos-1x1-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 22:58:58.479690

On December 5, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) issued a Memorandum emphasizing a “compliance first” policy in all existing and future compliance and enforcement matters. A summary of the Memorandum follows our analysis.

What Does the Memorandum Do?

The Memorandum directs EPA civil enforcement staff to prioritize compliance over prolonged negotiations, with early compliance emphasized while leaving the Superfund early action approach unchanged. The Memorandum outlines six guiding factors: (1) use of a compliance assistance toolkit (outreach, training, “find and fix” self-audits) to encourage voluntary compliance; (2) coordination with state partners to ensure consistency and allow states to join civil judicial actions; (3) open communication to avoid duplication and build trust with regulated entities; (4) clear, nationally consistent findings of violation based on the “best reading” of law and regulation; (5) efficient, economical compliance requirements and injunctive relief tied directly to governing statutes, with OECA approval required for SEPs and other remedies; and (6) reasoned decision-making under the “LEAPS” model (law, evidence, analysis, programmatic impact, stakeholder impact) to ensure sound enforcement outcomes.

Who Is Impacted

The Memorandum impacts any regulated entity engaging with EPA or DOJ in its representation of EPA in compliance or enforcement activities, especially for those defending some of EPA’s most novel or aggressive interpretations to form the basis for their alleged violations.

What Industry Should Do

The objectives of the Memorandum are to compel more streamlined enforcement, findings of violation based on the best reading of a regulation, less burdensome injunctive provisions, and fewer unexpected compliance assurance activities. Below are several steps companies should take to align with this Administration’s “compliance-first” orientation:

Compliance Programs: Because this Administration encourages proactive compliance, continue to ensure environmental compliance programs and related protocols are up to date, diligently implemented, and have the appropriate resources. In that regard, see recent U.S. Department of Justice Corporate Compliance Guidelines.

Find and Fix: The concept of “compliance first” refers not only to prioritization, but also to the timeline of when a company should come into compliance. Therefore, employ a “find and fix” approach by conducting confidential riskassessment audits and reviewing them to evaluate potential avenues for self-reporting and other voluntary compliance options, while protecting attorney-client privilege.

Be Communicative: Because this framework emphasizes open communication, consider staying in touch more regularly with relevant agencies at both the federal and state levels to maintain strong, trusting relationships with regulators. The Administration will expect to see the “no surprises” policy going both ways.

Finding of Violation: If your company receives a finding of violation that is uncertain or ambiguous, consult with counsel about raising and possibly elevating concerns with EPA. Under this framework, EPA must elevate such concerns to regional counsel or the Office of General Counsel.

Settlements: If enforcement settlements involve third-party audits, monitoring, or any other mitigation or stipulated remedy, ensure EPA personnel have obtained appropriate approval from the OECA Assistant Administrator, as is required under this framework. Also, do not expect settlements to involve SEPs until additional guidance is issued.

Analysis

Craig Pritzlaff, Acting Assistant Administrator of EPA’s OECA, issued the Memorandum, entitled “Reinforcing a ‘Compliance First’ Orientation for Compliance Assurance and Civil Enforcement Activities,” to OECA personnel. Pritzlaff advanced a similar “compliance first” policy during his tenure as Director of the Office of Compliance and Enforcement at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). Beveridge & Diamond’s Texas office has direct experience with the policy’s implementation in Texas and anticipated the roll out of a “compliance first” orientation nationwide.

While “compliance first” has long been EPA’s stated approach, the Memorandum calls for more frequent national elevation of regional violations and emphasizes open communication with regulated entities and coordination with state partners. The Memorandum could have significant impacts, potentially limiting the scope of EPA enforcement actions and reducing the agency’s utilization of novel theories or overbroad interpretations of the law in lieu of creating new rules.

The Memorandum should not be interpreted as a directive to reduce inspections or reduce enforcement generally. If implemented as it was at TCEQ, “compliance first” is not simply an Agency enforcement policy, but a view that the Agency intends for industry to embrace as well and well ahead of an inspection and enforcement. Companies should continue to prepare for inspections and regularly evaluate compliance status.

The Memorandum does not guarantee widespread change in environmental enforcement as a whole, and holding the Agency accountable to similar fair-play and best-reading-of-law concepts espoused in multiple Executive Orders has proved to be slow and often unsuccessful. However, the Memorandum will undoubtedly impact some cases and overall, and may shift emphasis to compliance actions and resolutions over more formal enforcement actions – that could mean more emphasis on administrative resolutions, more no-penalty Administrative Orders on Consent, and fewer judicial referrals. This may be especially true for regulated entities defending alleged violations based on novel or overreaching EPA legal interpretations that deviate substantially from years of past interpretive positions.

The Memorandum also elevates legal interpretations to Agency leadership, emphasizing that inspectors and enforcement staff, including attorneys, are not responsible for resolving ambiguity in federal environmental laws, but only for identifying and elevating such ambiguity when raised by a regulated entity. While this may expedite some resolution in some cases, in other instances, it may result in longer delays while leadership considers arguments and positions.

How much impact the Memorandum can have remains to be seen. The “find-it-fix-it” approach at TCEQ had strong legal support in the Texas Audit Act, which incentivizes industry self-audits and disclosures in ways that EPA’s own Audit Policy has failed to achieve. TCEQ also has an administrative Penalty Policy that, under Pritzlaff’s leadership, was updated regularly to make penalty calculations more transparent and more consistently applied. This is in contrast to EPA’s current discrete and inconsistent programmatic penalty policies, many of which are decades old and can result in enormous swings in penalty ranges.

And while the focus on administrative enforcement has benefits, industry should keep in mind that administrative orders often do not satisfy the diligent prosecution bars in defending citizen suits that civil judicial enforcement does. And, how Jarkesy (see B&D’s July 2024 alert here) will play out for EPA administrative actions is an issue to watch. All this means, of course, is that embracing “compliance first” cultures is the best first course of action.

Summary of the Memorandum

The Memorandum states that, effective immediately, all EPA personnel responsible for civil enforcement and compliance assurance activities must prioritize ensuring compliance when addressing ongoing and future potential non-compliance with federal environmental laws. This framework intends to streamline early compliance, rather than divert unnecessary resources into prolonged negotiations. The Memorandum also notes that it will not impact the established early action approach to Superfund enforcement. Below is a summary of the six factors relied upon in the Memorandum.

1. Compliance Assistance Toolkit

The first factor—the compliance assistance toolkit—is driven by OECA’s assertion that enforcement should not be the only means for achieving compliance. Instead, the Memorandum urges EPA personnel to use compliance assistance tools such as outreach, technical assistance, and training, including employing a “find and fix” approach to voluntary compliance through self-reporting and self-audits, to proactively encourage regulated entities to comply, rather than retroactively addressing compliance issues in enforcement. This approach is consistent with the first Trump administration’s efforts to prioritize compliance assistance rather than a standard “nail and hammer” enforcement approach that can occur once EPA identifies potential violations.

2. State Partner Coordination

Because most federal environmental laws delegate state authority for environmental compliance and enforcement, the Memorandum re-emphasizes the Trump administration’s priority of having OECA and EPA enforcement personnel work with states to ensure consistency and state input in compliance assurance and enforcement activities.

It should be noted that if a state is a co-plaintiff in a civil judicial action, then those actions may continue even during this push for “compliance first.” There is an incentive for states to join these actions to share in the penalty and coordinate on the implementation of injunctive relief. Additionally, at least in the RCRA context, states cannot join as a party in administrative actions.

3. Open Communication

Building on further coordination with state partners, the Memorandum also emphasizes open communication between all interested parties to ensure further clarity regarding required compliance. By strengthening communication, OECA seeks to avoid unnecessary or duplicative compliance assurance activities, which waste time and money. EPA emphasizes that more open communication will also help ensure there are “no surprises” for regulated entities and build trust between the parties, including encouraging voluntary compliance through self-reporting.

4. Finding of Violation

To avoid uncertainty, findings of violation must be “clear and unambiguous, well-tailored, and based on the ‘best reading’ of the relevant statute and regulation.” The “best reading” of a statute or regulation must consider statutory construction canons, past practice, and current litigation. The Memorandum contemplates regulated entities raising concerns about how EPA has applied a statute or regulation to their case, such as asserting potentially controversial or novel enforcement theories. When a regulated entity raises a concern, inspectors and enforcement staff, including attorneys, are expected to elevate it, including to OECA as needed. Any decision is to be made at the national level to ensure national consistency. Lastly, OECA plans to create consolidated criteria to more clearly define specific categories of violations, which will allow for more consistent findings of violations across all EPA programs and regions.

5. Compliance Requirements and Injunctive Relief

Recognizing that rapid compliance may not always be possible and that formal enforcement will be necessary, the Memorandum emphasizes, in such cases, that EPA must take the most efficient, economical, and swift strategy possible in its negotiations and litigation (if needed). An important addition is their requirement that any injunctive relief provisions shall be based on “the best, most defensible interpretation of the law” to quickly achieve compliance. Furthermore, settlements and orders must reflect a “clear nexus to the governing statute and implementing regulations.”

Additionally, the Memorandum rescinds EPA’s April 2021 memorandum, which set forth expansive injunctive relief tools for civil enforcement settlements, such as third-party audits or monitoring. The OECA Assistant Administrator must now approve the use of these tools prior to negotiation. This includes supplemental environmental projects (SEPs), a historically controversial remedy, which are not to be included in any settlement until EPA issues additional guidance (see B&D’s 2024 alert on SEPs here). Lastly, the OECA Assistant Administrator must approve the use of any other mitigation or stipulated remedy before negotiation. The Memorandum defines stipulated remedies as a settlement term that requires the implementation of a specified project in the event of any future violation of the settlement agreement but does not include stipulated penalties in this definition.

6. Reasoned Decision Making

The last factor requires OECA to use reasoned decision-making when determining non-compliance and enforcement remedies. This may be self-evident, but the Memorandum clarifies that decision-making must now follow the “LEAPS” model, using law, evidence, analysis, programmatic impact, and stakeholder impact to reach a sound, logical conclusion in compliance and enforcement actions.

Ionic Minerals Technology, or Ionic MT, found its Silicon Ridge mine is chock-full of critical minerals and rare earth elements. According to Andre Zeitoun, Ionic MT’s CEO and founder, the newly discovered supply could support initiatives to electrify transportation and bolster defense, all while reducing dependence on foreign markets.

Silicon Ridge’s deposit of critical and rare earth minerals is suspended in clay, not hard rock, making it easier to extract. The clay holds 16 critical minerals, Zeitoun said, including gallium and germanium, used in electronics, fiber-optic cables, and lasers. The mine holds a large supply of halloysite, a mineral used to build better batteries. China by far produces the lion’s share of critical minerals, and when it recently restricted exports on them, U.S. companies were sent scrambling for new supplies.

“Over the last 20 years, [we’ve] kind of put ourselves in a situation,” Zeitoun said, “where we’ve allowed ourselves to be solely reliant on imports of these metals that power our lives.”

The discovery at Silicon Ridge could open the door to finding more rare earths throughout Utah, said Katie Potter, a professional geologist and professor of practice at Utah State University.

“It may kick off a halloysite gold rush,” Potter said.

Zeitoun said his company can extract the materials with virtually zero waste and that it will use no explosives or chemicals at the site. “We really view ourselves as kind of a next generation of mining,” he said, “and of responsible mining.”

The Silicon Ridge mine lies west of Utah Lake, the heart of Utah County, about an hour’s drive south of Salt Lake City. Ionic MT leases the site from the State Trust Lands Administration. The company also holds a permit with the Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining, the terms of which remain confidential, state officials confirmed.

“We are excited about the ongoing progress on the project,” the agency’s director Mick Thomas said in a statement, “and the potential it represents.”

Rare earths are crucial for green technologies like wind turbines and solar panels, along with batteries and motors. Ionic MT launched in 2020 by mining halloysite from clay deposits in Juab County, near the town of Eureka. Halloysite is an aluminum-silicon mineral that electric vehicle manufacturers are tapping to help batteries charge faster and last longer.

“You can charge a vehicle as quickly as it takes to fill up a tank of gas,” Zeitoun said, “which is considered one of the key enablers of EV mass adoption.”

The company processes the mineral through a patented procedure at its 74,000 square-foot manufacturing plant in Provo. In search of more supplies, Ionic MT began exploring Silicon Ridge, but was surprised to find much more than halloysite.

“Our machine came back showing, in every single sample that we looked at, the same distribution of these metals,” Zeitoun said. “We first thought … maybe there’s a mistake.”

Third-party testing, however, revealed an abundance of metals, the CEO said. The Silicon Ridge deposit came from the same type of ancient volcanic formation that created rich deposits in China. That country currently produces around 60 percent of the planet’s supply of rare earths, and commands 90 percent of processing.

Similar deposits lie in Brazil and Australia, Zeitoun said, but Silicon Ridge is the only known analogue in the United States.

Utah’s halloysite formed from a volcanic flare up around 30 million years ago, Potter said. The ash settled near hot springs that created unique clays with tube structures.

“Those tubes can suck in rare earth elements and other critical metals, like lithium,” she said, “and prevent it from being leached or weathered away.”

Silicon Ridge’s proximity to roads, power lines, and a workforce make it favorable for mineral development as well, Potter said. “We also have climate change and a need to shift away from carbon-emitting energy resources,” she said. “If it’s not extracted here, where we have stronger environmental regulations … it’s going to be done by offloading those effects” to other countries.

Ionic MT initially leased 4,053 acres on Silicon Ridge from the Trust Lands Administration in 2023. They returned to that agency’s board in August seeking another 3,700 acres after more than 100 boreholes and trenches revealed ample rare earth and critical mineral concentrations in the clay.

The state will earn $13 per acre per year as part of the lease, and $1.60 per ton, or 10 percent of the gross value of the mined clay, whichever is greater, Trust Land documents show. All the revenue will go to Utah schools.

With state permits and a processing facility already in place, Zeitoun said his company is ready to move rapidly to begin harvesting the minerals. The mine could create hundreds of local jobs, he said.

The federal government has expressed interest in supporting the mine as well, according to Zeitoun, but he declined to disclose any details. The Trump administration has moved to secure more diverse supplies of rare earths in recent weeks after trade disputes with China.

State leaders, meanwhile, are having their own eureka moment over Ionic MT’s discovery. State Senate President Stuart Adams and House Speaker Mike Schultz, both Republicans, cited Silicon Ridge as a sign that Utah could be a powerhouse for clean energy. “Our state is uniquely positioned to lead the transition to cleaner energy,” Adams said in a news release Thursday, “by developing next-generation resources right in our own backyard.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Silicon-Ridge-Aerial-View.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:54.934253

Today marks 10 years since the ParisAgreement, when for the first time world leaders agreed to limit global warming to 1.5°C and to drive a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. And it feels like the world is turning a page, with some of it finally being in the right direction.

Exactly a month ago, world leaders gathered in Belém, Brazil for #COP30 the annual UN climate summit where governments make important decisions on climate action While the talks were far from perfect, something major happened. People powers shone through. From organizers, Indigenous and Traditional Peoples to youth and workers, everyday people showed up to put pressure on leaders and this led to some pretty historic progress:

In Colombia, the government declared its entire Amazon a fossil-free zone, a monumental step for Indigenous rights, forest protection, and global climate justice. The country will also host the world’s first International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels next year – a space that simply didn’t exist until climate movements and frontline communities demanded it.

COP30 host, Brazil, too took its first official step a few days ago, towards developing a national roadmap to phase out fossil fuels and open the door for communities to finally shape the country’s energy future.

You’ll read more about the impact people and our movement had inside and outside the COP30 negotiations, in the next section. But for now, I want to say this: These are not small shifts. They’re signs that the world is finally beginning to move in the direction people have been pushing for decades: a future where forests are protected, polluters are held accountable, and clean energy becomes a right, not a privilege.

So as 2025 ends, we’re feeling something rare: momentum. Real, global momentum led by everyday people who refuse to give up.

And for 2026? We have big, exciting work ahead and we’re glad you’re in this with us.

Movement Updates Discover our latest actions demanding climate solutions & energy justice

People power set the climate agenda at COP30

At this COP, it was the people, not politicians, who shaped the talks. For two weeks, Belém, pulsed with marches, music, and creativity as civil society turned this host city into a living call for climate justice. More than 70,000 people joined the People’s March for Climate Justice, carrying a symbolic funeral for fossil fuels, while over 200 boats transformed the Amazon River into a moving protest. Inside the UN “Blue Zone,” banner drops and our capybara action kept pressure high, reminding leaders of a simple truth: communities want rivers, not pipelines and a transition that serves people, not polluters.

Indigenous voices, stories, and solidarity took center stage

For the first time in years, COP felt rooted in land, culture, and lived experience with one of the largest Indigenous delegations in history of 3,000 representatives. We helped lift frontline leadership through powerful marches and story-driven actions like Amazon Free of Oil and Gas ritual and the premiere of the documentary Dear Ancestors from the Amazon, the Pacific, and so-called Canada — reminding leaders that climate action is about memory, identity, and protection of home. This surge of movement power helped secure the demarcation of ten Indigenous territories, a historic step for land rights and forest protection, strengthening the push for community-led renewable energy and Indigenous participation in every climate decision.

We pushed governments toward real and inclusive climate action

We worked tirelessly with partners to shift negotiations toward justice: demanding climate finance that protects people, not polluters and exposing the harm of fossil fuels. We drove momentum for the Transition Away From Fossil Fuels roadmap (TAFF), laying out how countries can wind down coal, oil, and gas in line with climate science, which gained support from almost 90 countries, although did not make it to the final text. Our advocacy did secure a major win: the Belém Action Mechanism (BAM)—a new just-transition framework centering workers, Indigenous Peoples, and frontline communities, now sits in the final CO30 text.

People’s power also met the G20 in South Africa

Alongside COP, the G20, a forum where the world’s biggest economies set global priorities, gathered in South Africa, meeting for the first time on African soil. So under We The 99%, we united workers, students, activists, and artists (the 99%) to demand climate justice, debt relief, and a fast, fair shift to renewables. Through town halls, workshops, open letters, a People’s Summit, and a mass uprising festival, we put civil society at the centre of this moment. While leaders launched the Africa Engagement Framework, a plan to deepen cooperation between the G20 and African governments on development and finance, they failed to commit to a fossil fuel phase-out, meaningful debt cancellation, or real climate finance. But we stand unwavering in our demands: Africa needs resources and justice to shape its own renewable future.

Climate Jargon Unpack the terms & concepts being used by climate activists & experts

BAM! (Belém Action Mechanism)

BAM is a new UN climate framework that makes sure the shift away from fossil fuels is fair by protecting workers, Indigenous Peoples, and frontline communities as the world transitions to clean energy.

Everyone at COP30 was talking about it. From badges to banners, “BAM!” became the rallying cry across the UN climate talks, a demand led by workers, Indigenous leaders, and climate justice groups who insisted that the energy transition must be fair, not harmful. Halfway through COP, countries representing about 80% of the world’s population signaled support for a just transition mechanism, building huge momentum.

The win: COP30 delivered and BAM was officially included in the final text. It means the UN now recognizes that climate action must center fairness, decent jobs, community protection, and Indigenous rights, alongside emissions numbers.

Why it matters: Until now, a “just transition” was mostly a promise on paper. Everyone agreed it was important, but no one was required to track progress or support communities through the shift. BAM changes that. It creates a formal space within the UN climate system to:

coordinate global action on just transition,

share best practices,

track whether countries are keeping their promises, and

help ensure support goes to those who need it most.

BAM turns justice from a slogan into a system. It’s a major step toward a transition that is fast and fair, and one of the biggest victories won by people at COP30.

No fossil fuel growth in 2025

For the first time in history, the world is on track for zero growth in fossil fuel generated electricity this year. Not because demand for electricity is falling, but because renewable energy is growing fast enough to meet all new electricity needs.

Two new, major reports explain this shift. The first, from Ember, a global energy think tank, shows solar grew an astonishing 31%, with wind close behind. Together, they covered the world’s soaring power demand, leaving no space for fossil expansion. Even in China and India, usually the biggest fossil users, fossil generation fell, replaced by record clean energy growth.

The second comes from the International Energy Agency (IEA), one of the world’s most influential energy bodies. Its latest outlook shows solar and wind rapidly outpacing fossil fuels, with clean power now cheaper, more reliable, and expanding fastest in emerging economies.

The message is clear: the fossil fuel era has peaked, and the renewable era is accelerating.

The Clean Air Act Resource for Data Centers page provides infrastructure developers with a host of information about the 1970 federal law. “Looking exclusively through the lens of the CAA, EPA’s specific new resources provide state and private sector partners with regulatory information, guidance and technical tools that can assist with modeling, air quality permitting, and regulatory interpretations relevant for data centers and AI facility development,” the agency’s press office said in response to a FedScoop request for comment Friday.

The page also shares information on how to “legally avoid requirements” of a Clean Air Act provision known as Limiting the Potential to Emit. The press office said the agency “is committed to following its statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act and helping our state partners do the same.”

The regulatory maneuvering is part of a broader Trump administration push under EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to cut red tape and speed up permitting.

“The global race to harness the power of artificial intelligence and build data centers is underway,” Zeldin said in a press release Thursday. “EPA is diligently working to eliminate burdensome regulations and ensure data centers and related facilities can be built in the U.S. as we Power the Great American Comeback. Developers, local communities and Tribes will now have easy access to the tools they need to build big, beautiful data centers and AI facilities.”

Zeldin’s statement and the webpage itself referenced President Donald Trump’s AI Action Plan and his January AI executive order as reasons for launching the resource, which also details how the agency has previously handled permitting and previews for data-center developers “what permitting requirements they may face.”

The energy agenda for Trump’s AI Action Plan leaned heavily on pared-down clean air and water regulations as a means to expedite permitting. The document specifically called for reduced regulations under the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as well as any “related laws.”

Proponents of the plan argued that the “environmental tradeoffs” for accelerating AI and data center construction were worth it, a point that Zeldin also attempted to make in a July op-ed for Fox News. The former Republican congressman from New York wrote that many of the Clean Air Act requirements for building data centers traced back to the 1990s, “when technology was practically prehistoric compared to modern advancements.”

“These rules require companies to install pollution control equipment when they build new facilities or make a change that increases emissions significantly,” Zeldin continued. “The digital revolution has ushered in new needs and new industries which demand new permitting rules that help, not hamper development.”

The new webpage claims that by speeding up the ability to build data centers “and the necessary backup generation,” the cost of new facilities will go down along with electricity rates. “This ultimately will reduce the cost-of-living for Americans who rely on data centers and AI for their daily lives — from ensuring food at the grocery store to photos on their phones,” the website states.

Whether those assertions pan out remains to be seen, but there’s been a bubbling public rejection of the nationwide data-center buildout amid spiking energy demand and skyrocketing utility costs. On Capitol Hill, bipartisan groups of lawmakers have introduced legislation tiptoeing around the issues, including one bill on liquid cooling technologies to potentially address high facility costs and another to study the impact data centers are having on rural America.

Nevertheless, the EPA’s new website signals that the administration intends to move full steam ahead with its plans to streamline permitting and quicken data-center construction. Aaron Szabo, the EPA’s assistant administrator for air, said in the press release that the webpage demonstrates the agency’s commitment to “following the law and helping Americans do the same.”

“Good rulemaking and policies must be coupled with sound public knowledge regarding regulations,” Szabo said. “As EPA works to enact policy that helps make America the AI capital of the world, our new webpage provides an essential resource to those looking to understand the current regulations,” adding that his office “is pleased to be able to respond directly to the request from developers, local communities and Tribes who have been asking for these resources since day one.”",https://fedscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/12/GettyImages-2216114246.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:01:10.272331

The public deserves an EPA that protects them, not one that treats exposure of dangerous chemicals as an acceptable risk,” she added.
The EPA published the draft formaldehyde risk assessment on December 3 and is asking for feedback on it through February 2.","WASHINGTON – The Environmental Protection Agency is again putting public health at risk: almost doubling the amount of formaldehyde, the cancer-causing chemical, it considers safe to inhale.

It’s the latest in a string of EPA actions that clash with the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, movement. Instead of pursuing MAHA’s goal of tackling health harms from toxic chemicals, the agency is opening the door to more exposure.

The EPA’s revised assessment of formaldehyde’s risks(link is external), released last week, would overturn a Biden EPA finding(link is external) that effectively states there is no safe level of exposure to the chemical. At the time, some critics said even that finding did not go far enough in acknowledging formaldehyde’s risks.

The chemical is widely used in building materials and many consumer goods, such as clothing, bedding, furniture and toys, among others. Science links the chemical to cancer, leukemia, respiratory illness, reproductive damage and other serious health harms.

Several federal agencies and international governing bodies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(link is external), the National Institutes of Health(link is external) and the World Health Organization(link is external), classify formaldehyde as a known human carcinogen.

Scientists agree carcinogens like formaldehyde pose health risks, even at very low doses.

Risking more pollution

“This new EPA action opens the door to more pollution and may fundamentally change the agency’s framework for chemical risk assessment, said David Andrews, Ph.D., the Environmental Working Group’s acting chief science officer.

“This change will enable chemical companies to profit further at the expense of public health.”

Not surprisingly, the revised risk assessment was heavily influenced by former chemical industry officials now leading the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, according to reports by the New York Times(link is external) and ProPublica(link is external).

Those officials, Nancy Beck and Lynn Dekleva, are both former senior directors at the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry’s main trade group. They played a key role in pushing the agency’s new industry-backed stance, which abandons the long-standing EPA scientific principle (link is external)that even low-level exposure to known carcinogens poses risks.

""This decision shows just how far the Trump EPA is willing to go to put industry interests above public health,” said EWG Vice President for Government Affairs Melanie Benesh.

“Doubling the so-called ‘safe’ level of formaldehyde isn’t science – it’s a gift to industry. The public deserves an EPA that protects them, not one that treats exposure of dangerous chemicals as an acceptable risk,” she added.

Undermining MAHA

This regulatory rollback is part of a broader effort by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Beck and Dekleva to weaken chemical safety standards.

That effort directly undermines the goals of the MAHA movement by exposing workers, families and communities to a well-documented carcinogen at levels the EPA’s own scientists have warned are unsafe.

It’s the latest in a string of EPA and other federal agency actions that conflict with MAHA’s goals of reducing exposure to harmful chemicals, including pesticides.

The EPA published the draft formaldehyde risk assessment on December 3 and is asking for feedback on it through February 2.

In cities, in particular, their work is vital to mitigating environmental challenges like the urban heat island effect, stormwater management and ecological restoration. As cities strive to become climate resilient, landscape architecture faculty and students at SEAS are laser-focused on finding sustainable solutions that benefit the public.

Cooling Urban Heat Islands

People don’t realize it, but on average, cities are 14 to 20 degrees hotter than rural areas. This is due in large part to the urban heat island effect caused by building materials, asphalt, dark surfaces and perhaps most notably, a lack of trees. Keenan Gibbons, a lecturer at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) and a landscape architect with SmithGroup, is using infrared drones to find hot spots in cities and cool them down, which is crucial for public health, energy conservation and sustainability.

This nationwide work, which began in 2018, started in Ann Arbor on Huron Street, where Gibbons was hired to redesign the landscape, including the planting of 130 shade trees.

“It was a pretty big transformation from that barren sidewalk,” says Gibbons. “We established a baseline temperature and have measured it in the years since, and by year five, we measured a reduction in surface temperatures by about 12 degrees.”

Gibbons, whose work is mostly based in Detroit, where he’s currently working on the Corktown Greenway, a community-centered project that will span multiple streets and integrate green spaces and bike lanes, says that reducing surface temperatures is essential as we learn to live on a warming planet.

“While some of my work is mitigating the issues working with what’s already there, adding green spaces, water, shade and brightly colored materials, the ultimate goal is to help inform better design decisions in the future,” says Gibbons.

Green Stormwater Solutions

Following her groundbreaking work in Minnesota in the mid-1990s, which included design and implementation of rainwater gardens, now commonly seen in cities throughout the U.S., SEAS Professor Joan Nassauer says that her interest in green stormwater infrastructure, a method of managing stormwater runoff using systems that mimic natural processes to absorb, filter and store water, is part of the reason she came to U-M.

“It was obvious to me that there were enormous opportunities for green stormwater infrastructure in Detroit. Even when I started working with community partners there in 1999, there were 10,000 vacant properties in the city, and it was clear they could be selectively employed as part of neighborhood green stormwater infrastructure,” says Nassauer.

With a focus on urban design that incorporates the stormwater management potentials of vacant property, Nassauer has built partnerships in Detroit that have allowed her and her students to contribute to a shift from skepticism about green infrastructure to understanding its importance for limiting downstream pollution and climate-induced localized flooding, with profound impacts on people and ecosystems.

Nassauer says that the landscape characteristics of different cities, with varying local community aesthetics, are essential to the successful implementation of green infrastructure.

“Detroit is a relatively flat landscape with clayey soils and many vacant lots and existing green spaces, so green infrastructure should be designed differently than in Seattle or Los Angeles,” says Nassauer. “For every city, local community aesthetics matter. People are more likely to want it in their own neighborhood if it looks attractive to their eye rather than neglected.”

Mapping for Ecological Restoration

Making decisions about land use, ecological restoration and climate resilience in cities means having clear and up-to-date information. This can be harder than it seems, which is why Lisa DuRussel (BS ’02, MLA ’06), SEAS associate professor of practice and engagement, and her students recently worked on affordable and accessible ways to gather the visual and spatial context needed to ensure the successful restoration and future planning for Eliza Howell Park in Detroit, a capstone project supported by the Detroit Sustainability Clinic.

“Last spring, we collaborated with Sidewalk Detroit, a nonprofit that engages with residents to improve public spaces, and the City of Detroit, to connect our ecological and design expertise with geographic information systems mapping to offer a low-cost way to map out lots and properties at the park rather than hiring a costly surveyor,” says DuRussel.

Using a drone, the project team was able to evaluate landscape-scale ecological conditions that are often difficult to assess quickly and affordably, such as canopy cover, drainage analysis, vegetation health and erosion, and provide high-resolution data to inform restoration, design and planning.

The project resulted in ecological management recommendations for the 250-acre mostly undeveloped park, and a strategy for climate-resilient and biodiverse landscapes that can be replicated across all of Detroit’s parks.

“The impact of this work can reach multiple communities throughout Detroit as the city strives for holistic management, ecological resilience and accessibility of its parks for years to come,” says DuRussel",https://seas.umich.edu/sites/default/files/styles/hero/public/2025-12/urban-heat-island%202.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 21:59:51.639468

Many climate experts believe that new technologies are needed to achieve deep electric sector decarbonization, whether carbon capture and storage, new nuclear, advanced geothermal, long-duration energy storage or other emerging sources.

In particular, CCS-equipped power plants may be an appealing decarbonization option, given their dispatchable nature, support from federal incentives like the 45Q tax credit and ability to scale. The recently announced Broadwing project in Decatur, Illinois, as well as those in Baytown, Texas, and southeastern Wyoming are among those that could usher in a wave of new CCS generation. Given projections for AI-related demand growth, this would be a welcome development.

In the absence of regulatory mandates, CCS projects will only advance if they are able to secure additional funding for their low emissions output to offset the cost of carbon capture and disposal. While federal 45Q tax credits provide significant contributions toward CCS project economics, to date this has not proven sufficient to spur widespread adoption of CCS. Clean energy buyers who are willing to pay a premium for low-carbon, firm electricity may be a key force in enabling the viability of CCS projects, but these buyers will need a way to claim the low-carbon attributes of this electric supply.

Clean energy buyers use renewable energy credits and zero-emissions credits to claim that their energy use is associated with an emissions-free resource. A similar energy attribute certificate could be issued for CCS-backed generation, although not necessarily conveying a zero-emissions attribute. EACs are commonly used in Scope 2 emissions accounting under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard.

When CCS applications at power plants intersect with greenhouse gas accounting, two fundamental questions arise: What greenhouse gas emissions reductions should be attributed to these projects, and how should these be claimed by consumers of their electricity?

Behind these questions are many more:

What components of the capture and storage process should be measured and tracked?

How should different fuels and different CO2 end uses be treated?

How should projects that achieve different levels of capture be differentiated?

What verification methods are needed to ensure a credible emissions claim?

Establishing a consistent answer to all these questions, and more, will help ensure there is a uniform attribute for CCS generation and promote market confidence on the integrity of emissions claims. NorthBridge Group conducted broad outreach to climate-focused nongovernmental organizations, attribute registries, clean energy buyers, CCS project developers and other emissions accounting experts. We used that input in developing a standards document that proposes how registries can issue, track and retire energy attribute certificates for electricity generated with CCS. In it, we define a methodology for calculating emissions from CCS-backed electricity generators, set requirements for data reporting and verification, and propose required and recommended features. Energy tracking registries that currently issue and track RECs or other EACs can use this document for guidance.

Several key issues we address include:

Attribute structure. An EAC is issued for each megawatt-hour of generation. The EAC is minted with an associated emission rate measured in pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per MWh. When retired, the attribute holder may claim the pounds of CO2e listed on the attribute in its market-based Scope 2 inventory. The emission rate will reflect the performance of the project during the period the EAC covers.

Eligibility. The calculation methodology applies to multiple fuel types, generation technologies and post-capture CO2 pathways. Registries may elect to issue EACs only to certain fuel types or post-capture pathways. To aid buyers, the EAC may designate the fuel source and CO2 pathway.

Processes considered. The emission rate calculation methodology includes emissions from electricity generation, CO2 capture, transportation and storage so that the EAC represents emissions from all activities required to ensure permanent CO2 storage. Emissions from on-site activities as well as purchased energy are included. Though the standard acknowledges the potential for the EAC to reflect the carbon intensity of the upstream fuel supply, it does not propose how to do so or recommend doing so at this time.

Monitoring and verification. All project data is subject to independent third-party verification. There is a requirement to submit monitoring and reporting plans, which can be met through other regulatory documentation.

Leakage. To protect an attribute holder’s emissions claims against the potential impact of post-injection leakage, all projects will be required to hold some form of self-insurance. The standard recommends a menu of options that registries may offer and from which projects can choose, such as private insurance, credit reserves or holdbacks, and issuing EACs with built-in leakage estimates.

We acknowledge that the work is not done. An EAC that bears an emission rate may represent a new frontier for many energy-tracking registries that will undoubtedly take work and time to implement. More revisions may be necessary, especially if technical working groups in the GHG Protocol standards update process offer new guidance. And some questions, such as how or if upstream fuel considerations should be folded into the attribute, are acknowledged but not answered.

Nonetheless, a standardized attribute for CCS-equipped electricity generation will allow clean energy buyers to engage with new forms of low-carbon, dispatchable electricity, and developers can monetize these attributes in support of project economics. We are hopeful that this work can meaningfully advance the viability of projects that contribute to the deep decarbonization of an electric grid.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xeDhr5lxGJaRE_xF6sx3i2U0nYJYU-Gkg4NYmKBzogk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNTc2MTM5NzlfaUdWNURJdC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-12 20:00:07.694538

No-Fee PPO Service Bills Pass Senate Unanimously

This week, I was pleased that Senate Bills 611 and 612 passed the Senate unanimously. Sponsored by myself and Senator Ruth Johnson, these bills will make a big difference for victims of stalking and domestic violence who are seeking a Personal Protection Order. These bills now await hearings and a vote in the House. If enacted, Michigan would join 43 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories that already require PPO services to be provided free of charge.

Currently, the cost to serve a PPO can include a service fee plus mileage traveled, which can easily cost almost $100 — an amount that could be especially tough for someone fleeing domestic violence to afford. This legislation would not only make it less financially burdensome for victims but also safer by ensuring the PPO is served by a member of law enforcement rather than a friend or family member of the victim, which is allowed under current law. When someone has gathered the courage to share what has happened to them and secure a PPO, our state should not put up financial barriers to their safety.

Senate Acts to Deliver Relief for Michiganders Facing UIA Benefit Recovery

During the chaos of the pandemic, thousands of Michiganders turned to their government for help, tapping into the unemployment system to put food on the table, pay their bills, and ensure their families could weather a once-in-a-lifetime global health crisis. Since then, the Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) has been attempting to claw back overpayments it mistakenly made to these same individuals — causing stress for many across the state at an already financially tough time.

Let’s be clear: these families did nothing wrong. That’s why, earlier this week, alongside every single Senator, both Democratic and Republican, I voted to pass legislation that would provide a clean slate for these folks by waiving any overpayments the UIA is currently attempting to collect from this pandemic-era timeframe. Senate Bill 700 now heads to the Michigan House, where I’m hopeful they will act quickly, so we can deliver relief to those who need it most.

Expanding Opportunity, Lowering Costs, & Protecting Michigan: Senate Democrats Reflect on Progress From 2025

As we approach the end of 2025 and wrap up our legislative work for the year, I’d like to take a moment to reflect on the progress we’ve delivered for the people of Michigan. Together, my Senate Democratic colleagues and I:

Saved Medicaid in Michigan, protecting access to accessible, affordable health care;

Expanded the widely successful Rx Kids program to improve maternal and infant health outcomes;

Delivered another bipartisan budget that continues the universal free school meals program, implements a long-term road solution, and lowers costs for seniors and families;

Advanced commonsense gun safety policies to keep our communities safe;

Fought back against federal chaos and safeguarded our state from the worst effects of Trump’s disastrous budget plan;

Strengthened protections and benefits for Michigan veterans and their families;

Championed legislation to improve government accountability, tackle racial and ethnic maternal health disparities, lower prescription drug costs, expand transparency in the state budget process, and so much more.

I’m proud of the work we’ve accomplished this year, despite the many obstacles and unprecedented setbacks we faced at both the state and federal levels of government. While we’ll be working in Lansing until the end of the month, I’m already planning ahead for 2026 and looking forward to another productive year advocating for our communities and our state. I also encourage you to stay informed about the legislation moving through the Senate in the coming weeks. Feel free to track the legislation we’re working on here.

Fighting Food Insecurity This Holiday Season and Beyond

Everyone deserves access to quality, nutritious food, full stop — but this year, the demand for food assistance is higher than ever as grocery costs soar and federal Republicans have disrupted Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and restricted eligibility. Approximately 1.5 million Michiganders face food insecurity, including over 402,000 children.

My Senate Democratic colleagues and I have worked hard to ensure that every Michigan family has access to food not only during the holidays, but year-round. From proposing $71 million in relief funding to support food banks and continue SNAP benefits during the federal shutdown to delivering another year of free school meals for every Michigan student, we’ve made significant progress in combating food insecurity here in our state.

Neighbors discussed the negative impact the facility has on their bodies and home lives, citing a constant smell and taste of chemicals. The lawmakers who spoke at the press conference included Rep. Tonya Myers Phillips (D-7) and Rep. Donavan McKinny (D-11), both of whom emphasized the right to breathe clean air and quality of life. Rev. Sharon Buttry, community leader of the DHCAHE, called on the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (BSEED) to shut down the hazardous waste treatment plant and not renew its permit. Earlier this year, I submitted public comment to EGLE expressing my strong concern about the facility’s proposed renewal permit and the related odor and air quality violations.

Standing up for Communities

This week, I, along with several other Michigan elected officials, sent a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) urging the immediate release of Ernesto Cuevas Enciso on bond pending his upcoming immigration hearing. Ernesto is the husband of a United States citizen and the father of a one-year-old child. He is a former DACA recipient with legal work authorization and a pending application for legal permanent residency. We are advocating for his release home to his family, not held at the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin. Here is a link to the letter.

We also joined a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field directors in Michigan and Texas, urging them to release four Western International High School students and their families: Kerly Mariangel Sosa Rivero and her father, Gleiner Jose Sosa Mujica; Antony Janier Peña Sosa and his mother, Maryeli Antonieta Sosa Marquina; Mor Ba; and Santiago Jesus Zamora Perez and his mother, Evelin Josefina Perez. These young people and their parents arrived in the United States from Venezuela or Senegal, and all have pending asylum cases. The students are all following the immigration process and are not considered a risk to public safety. Here is a link to the letter.

In a letter sent last week, several Michigan legislators and I called on ICE to address the concerning living conditions for people held in custody in its facilities. We would like to ensure that Alee Vang and others receive the proper required medication and are asking ICE to reduce overcrowding, implement emergency improvements to sanitation and nutrition, ensure adequate on-site medical staffing, and increase oversight and transparency.

Filing smart lawsuits remains the first and best way to counter assaults on the environment and preserve essential protections.

A deliberate barrage of federal attacks requires us to be equally relentless in our response. We are growing our bench of expert litigators, policy experts, and communicators so that we can challenge our opponents in Washington at every turn. The fights ahead are not new, but their volume and intensity are unprecedented. Taking the government to court — along with their allies in polluting industries — has never been more important or more labor-intensive.

Shape the Law

If left unchecked, this Supreme Court could eviscerate the authority of any future president or Congress to address environmental crises.

It took polluters and their allies 40 years to elect politicians and seat judges friendly to their interests. Now, they are pursuing the most aggressive agenda in modern history to dismantle environmental laws and regulations.

In the face of disruptive Supreme Court rulings, such as the Sackett v. EPA decision gutting federal protections for clean water and wetlands, Earthjustice is investing heavily in our Strategic Legal Advocacy team to navigate the changing legal landscape and secure wins in other legal venues, such as lower and state courts.

Force Progress

We know that defense will not be enough.

States and cities have the ability to advance environmental progress on their own, and when they do, they can raise the bar for everyone. We are growing our work with clients and partners to create legal and political pressure to keep moving forward, accelerating clean energy, climate resilience, and toxics regulation at the state and local level.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/stu-gillespie_spenser-heaps.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:02:56.782263

“New York is leading the clean energy revolution, and NYPA is powering that progress with bold investments in workforce development,” Hochul said.
Since 2024, NYPA has obligated more than $41 million for clean energy training programs, supporting more than 1,700 trainees and more than 30 workforce training organizations statewide.
NYPA’s collaboration with the skills-training organizations include input on the classroom and hands-on technology experiences of the enrollees for promoting the requisite clean energy skills to ensure statewide reach of the awards.
In September, Governor Hochul announced the convening of an advanced nuclear energy workforce roundtable in New York City.","New York Gov. Kathy Hochul recently announced $40 million in new annual workforce development funding over the next four years from the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop the workforce needed to support advanced nuclear energy in Upstate New York.

The funding, approved today by the NYPA Board of Trustees, will directly support the Governor’s call in June for the Power Authority to develop at least one gigawatt of advanced nuclear power in Upstate New York.

The Power Authority board also awarded a total of $4 million to universities and organizations to develop and expand programs that prepare New Yorkers for high-demand careers in artificial intelligence, electromechanical trades, and advanced power systems to meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.

“New York is leading the clean energy revolution, and NYPA is powering that progress with bold investments in workforce development,” Hochul said. “By investing in the advanced nuclear workforce and expanding access to affordable, hands-on training in AI and advanced energy systems, we’re preparing New Yorkers for the high-quality, high-demand jobs of tomorrow — and ensuring every community can share in the benefits of a cleaner, more equitable energy future.”

Beginning next year, NYPA will partner with qualified workforce development providers, including technical high schools, community colleges, universities, labor unions, and others to utilize the $40 million over a four-year period to develop nuclear energy technical training, retraining, coursework and apprenticeship programs to prepare workers for employment in the advanced nuclear energy field.

NYPA President and CEO Justin Driscoll said, “New York’s clean-energy transition only works if it comes with real career opportunities for the people who live in our communities. Building on the success of our annual investment of up to $25 million for clean energy training to support the renewable energy sector, the Power Authority will add up to $40 million over four years to develop and retrain the workforce necessary to support advanced nuclear power, providing more opportunities for New Yorkers to pursue careers in this high-demand industry.”

The Power Authority’s approval of $4 million for clean energy workforce training stems from a commitment of up to $25 million annually, as outlined in the 2023-24 Enacted State Budget.

The budget legislation also directed NYPA to advance renewable energy projects that will strengthen New York’s electric grid with a portfolio of diversified energy resources. Since 2024, NYPA has obligated more than $41 million for clean energy training programs, supporting more than 1,700 trainees and more than 30 workforce training organizations statewide.

The NYPA Board of Trustees approved the awards to the following organizations and institutions:

The Healthy Home Academy – Brewster, NY - $911,000

Resources will be directed to support classroom and hands-on learning experiences in home performance, high efficiency heating, ventilation, air conditioning and heat pumps.

The State University of New York at Buffalo - $832,000

The funding will be used to establish an AI fellowship program with the New York Power Authority and UB’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (IAD) to build a workforce pipeline and allow students to work alongside NYPA experts to address key challenges for the state in the clean energy industry.

The Green Launchpad – Statewide - $734,000

The funding award will expand a comprehensive program that includes clean energy building fundamentals, hands-on labs, advanced technical training, and career services.

Genesee Valley BOCES – Mount Morris, NY - $677,000

The funding will create an electro-mechanical trades program at the Charles G. May Center and to expand an existing program at its Batavia campus.

The State University of New York at Stony Brook – $644,000

The award will be leveraged to launch the University’s inaugural Power Pathways Workforce Readiness program, which will train students in both trade-based and advanced technology disciplines. The program will provide certification and training in areas including solar, drone inspections, geothermal heat pumps, and HVDC power systems.

The State University of New York at Binghamton – $203,000

The funds will be used to support the development and instruction of two new courses- Systems Dynamics and Simulation and Fundamentals of Power Systems as well as expand experiential learning opportunities and paid industry internships.

NYPA Chairman and Western New York Resident John R. Koelmel said, “Building on NYPA’s long history of strengthening the Western New York workforce and advancing statewide training programs, the Board's action today will prepare New Yorkers to thrive in the clean energy economy. The new AI fellowship pairs University at Buffalo students with NYPA's technical experts to advance clean energy solutions while equipping students to succeed in the classroom, on the job, and throughout their careers.”

The NYPA clean energy workforce development funding awards largely support the efforts of the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) to connect workers to job opportunities in the clean energy economy. Many of the upskilling and training initiatives have a focus on serving those who are traditionally underrepresented, especially within disadvantaged communities. This fall, Hochul announced the NYPA Board of Trustees’ approval of $12 million for electric vehicle training programs and support for trainees’ childcare, transportation, student fees and books through the NYSDOL Support Services Fund.

NYPA actively engages with each community training organization to ensure skills training is matched with needed positions and participant success through supportive wraparound services. NYPA’s collaboration with the skills-training organizations include input on the classroom and hands-on technology experiences of the enrollees for promoting the requisite clean energy skills to ensure statewide reach of the awards.

In September, Governor Hochul announced the convening of an advanced nuclear energy workforce roundtable in New York City.

The event, hosted by the Power Authority, brought together leaders from across New York, the U.S. and Canada, including NYPA, the New York State Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the Department of Labor (DOL), the Building and Construction Trades Council, State University of New York (SUNY), Department of Public Service (DPS), Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), Ontario Power Generation (OPG), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), and the Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA).",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-12 18:00:46.614440

But a few thousand feet underground is a hidden source of abundant clean energy — and it was discovered in an unusual way.

Utah-headquartered startup Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals announced last week it had used artificial intelligence to locate a 250-degree Fahrenheit geothermal reservoir under this stretch of land. They named it “Big Blind,” because this kind of site — which has no visual indication of its existence, no hot springs or geysers above ground, and no history of geothermal exploration — is known as a “blind” system.

It’s the first industry-discovered blind site in more than three decades, said Carl Hoiland, co-founder and CEO of Zanskar. “The idea that geothermal is tapped out has been the narrative for decades,” but that’s far from the case, he told CNN. He believes there are many more hidden sites across the Western US.

Geothermal energy is a potential gamechanger. It offers the tantalizing prospect of a huge source of clean energy to meet burgeoning demand. It’s near limitless, produces scarcely any climate pollution, and is constantly available, unlike wind and solar, which are cheap but rely on the sun shining and the wind blowing.

The problem, however, has been how to find and scale it.

It requires a specific geology: underground reservoirs of hot water or steam, along with porous rocks that allow the water to move through them, heat up, and be brought to the surface where it can power turbines.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were high levels of excitement around geothermal, with oil and gas giants spending huge amounts drilling to find hidden systems, Hoiland said. By the mid-80s, however, many had started to give up, put off by high costs and low success rates.

It’s a “classic needle in the haystack problem,” said Joel Edwards, co-founder and CTO of Zanskar. “There’s no one type of data that tells you that a system is below you, even if you’re right on top of it.” Instead, there are multiple indicators which are really hard for humans to put together to figure out if a system exists.

That’s where AI comes in.

The AI models Zanskar uses are fed information on where blind systems already exist. This data is plentiful as, over the last century and more, humans have accidentally stumbled on many around the world while drilling for other resources such as oil and gas.

The models then scour huge amounts of data — everything from rock composition to magnetic fields — to find patterns that point to the existence of geothermal reserves. AI models have “gotten really good over the last 10 years at being able to pull those types of signals out of noise,” Hoiland said.

Once a potential location has been found, the next step for the company is to drill down to confirm the reserve exists and is hot enough to produce utility-scale power.

That’s exactly what they did at Big Blind over the summer, drilling wells to depths of around 2,700 feet where they found porous rock at 250 degrees Fahrenheit. They know the site is at least the minimum size needed to support a power plant, but don’t yet have a sense of how big it could be.

There is also work to be done to navigate permitting processes and grid interconnection, but the company estimates the first electricity could be produced here in three to five years’ time.

Zanskar’s discovery “is very significant,” said James Faulds, a professor of geosciences at Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology. (Faulds does not work with the company, but two of his former graduate students do.)

Estimates suggest over three-quarters of US geothermal resources are blind, Faulds told CNN. “Refining methods to find such systems has the potential to unleash many tens and perhaps hundreds of gigawatts in the western US alone,” he said.

An oft-cited government analysis from 2008 estimated undiscovered geothermal reserves in the US could provide around 30 gigawatts of power, enough to power around 25 million homes. Hoiland thinks the real figure could be at least 10 times higher.

Over the last three years of scouring the Western US, Zanskar has identified many “hotspots” with the same characteristics as Big Blind, Hoiland said.

Big Blind is the company’s first blind site discovery, but it’s the third site it has drilled and hit commercial resources. “We expect dozens, to eventually hundreds, of new sites to be coming to market,” Hoiland said.

If Zanskar can keep its costs down, “that will go a long way in attracting investment,” said Sophia Bauer, geothermal project manager at Global Energy Monitor, a non-profit. Geothermal has a big advantage because it can harness drilling techniques already fine-tuned by the oil and gas industry, she told CNN.

Another advantage is political. “In the United States right now, the atmosphere is quite friendly to geothermal,” Bauer said. While the Trump administration has taken an ax to solar and wind, geothermal has gone under the radar and is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years, according to a March report from Global Energy Monitor, authored by Bauer.

There’s plenty of scope to grow. The US leads the world in geothermal energy, accounting for about 24% of global installed capacity, but geothermal accounts for only 0.4% of the country’s electricity mix.

Some experts hope geothermal will help fulfill the soaring electricity demand from data centers, many of which are used for AI. “Perhaps we have a close future of AI powered by geothermal discovering more geothermal!” Bauer said.

Zanskar’s discovery is the latest development in what some are calling a geothermal renaissance. Much of the recent buzz has been around next-gen geothermal techniques, which use advanced tools of the oil and gas industry — including fracking — to drill very deep wells and artificially create the conditions needed to harness geothermal energy.

But Hoiland says Zanskar’s work shows conventional geothermal still has huge untapped potential.

Joseph Moore, a University of Utah geologist, said AI could be a “gamechanger” for the industry, provided its success at finding hidden geothermal systems can be replicated multiple times.

“It’s the latest advancement for this benign, renewable energy source,” he told CNN. “Frankly, it’s all very exciting to see.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/pmc-5520.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-12 18:01:37.903363

The solution enables AD operators to convert hard-to-digest biomass and AD digestate into additional renewable energy and carbon-rich biochar, improving the overall efficiency and economics of RNG production.

Many AD plants face biogas-output limitations due to the low biodegradability of certain organic feedstocks. CETY’s High Temperature Ablative Pyrolysis (HTAP) technology thermochemically converts forestry residues, agricultural waste, and other non-food biomass inputs into clean syngas. When paired with anaerobic or catalytic methanation systems, this syngas can be upgraded to pipeline-quality RNG.

A single HTAP unit producing 1,500 Nm³/hour of syngas can support production equivalent to approximately 13 MMBtu/hour of additional RNG, placing one HTAP system between a medium- and large-scale AD facility in terms of incremental RNG output.

The platform also addresses a growing industry challenge: digestate management. Digestate can contain more than 55% of unprocessed volatile solids, requiring long composting periods and incurring handling costs. HTAP thermochemically converts digestate into syngas—supporting up to 1.3–1.6 MW of onsite power or up to 8 MMBtu/hour of supplementary RNG—and into biochar that can be tested and certified for agricultural or industrial applications. Biochar can offer carbon stability, pathogen elimination, improved soil conditioning characteristics, and eligibility for carbon sequestration credits, subject to certification.

Alexander Skorokhodov, director of technology at CETY, stated, “Anaerobic digestion is a proven pathway for renewable gas, but digestibility limits and digestate handling costs restrict its full potential.” HTAP unlocks the remaining energy in hard-to-digest biomass and converts digestate into clean energy and biochar.

By leveraging a breakthrough in the use of iron in the proven sodium metal chloride battery, Inlyte can scale rapidly.” Iron–sodium isn’t a universal replacement for lithium-ion.
This split of roles positions iron–sodium to deepen market penetration in utility-scale storage, where resilience and affordability matter most.","The energy storage market is entering a new phase where non-lithium chemistries are gaining traction. Iron–sodium batteries, a high-temperature sodium metal chloride chemistry that incorporates iron to reduce cost and reliance on constrained metals, are among the most promising contenders. The question isn’t whether they will replace lithium-ion in every market, but where they can take the lead.

Market momentum for non‑lithium chemistries

Lithium-ion remains the workhorse for electric vehicles (EVs), portable devices, and short- to medium-duration grid applications thanks to its energy density, fast response, and mature manufacturing. Yet the industry’s rapid growth and the need to diversify supply chains have increased interest in chemistries based on abundant elements such as sodium and iron. These systems avoid flammable liquid electrolytes, offer robust safety characteristics, and aim to deliver utility‑scale capacity without the cost volatility tied to lithium, nickel, and cobalt. As market volumes rise, portfolio thinking—matching technology to task—becomes a commercial imperative, not just a technical preference.

Bridging the long-duration gap

Long-duration energy storage (LDES) is where iron–sodium can credibly shift the balance. The U.S. Department of Energy projects the future U.S. grid will need more than 225 gigawatts of LDES by 2050. Lithium-ion batteries perform well for one to four hours, often up to six, but their economic viability and temperature control become more difficult as the duration extends to eight, twelve, or twenty-four hours.

Iron–sodium batteries are engineered for multi-hour to multi-day output, leveraging a solid electrolyte and elevated operating temperatures to deliver steady performance with strong safety margins. They’re designed to firm variable renewables, improve resilience during extreme weather, and help defer costly transmission and distribution upgrades—exactly the roles LDES must play to make a clean grid reliable and affordable.

Utility‑observed progress: Inlyte’s Milestone

The transition from lab promise to grid reality depends on utility-grade validation, and Inlyte Energy’s recent advance is a clear example. The company completed a factory acceptance test of its first field-ready iron–sodium battery system at its facility near Derby, UK, witnessed by representatives from Southern Company, one of the largest U.S. energy providers.

According to the company, the integrated systems (cells, inverter, and controls) achieved 83% round-trip efficiency, including auxiliaries, competitive with high-performance lithium-ion and notably above the 40–70% typical for other LDES approaches. Inlyte claims that the tested system represents the world's largest sodium metal chloride battery cells and modules ever constructed, capable of storing over 300 kilowatt-hours of energy each.

Inlyte’s CEO, Antonio Baclig, states: “To win the future, we need abundant and secure supplies of energy in the U.S., and at the same time, we need to make costs go down, not up. We can’t do that by building the same thing as China. We need to make better technologies, with batteries that are fundamentally lower cost, safer, and longer lasting. By leveraging a breakthrough in the use of iron in the proven sodium metal chloride battery, Inlyte can scale rapidly.”

Iron–sodium isn’t a universal replacement for lithium-ion. Instead, it can improve grid performance by allowing lithium-ion to lead in mobility and short peaks, while iron–sodium covers longer durations. This split of roles positions iron–sodium to deepen market penetration in utility-scale storage, where resilience and affordability matter most.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt6d0a56a726385625/693c844b866c6228e094c390/Inlyte_Energy_sodium_modules_test.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-12 18:00:39.517847

Dori Drachman, the chair of the hub’s board, says one reason she thinks a fund like this will work is because she saw how federal incentives encouraged people to make climate-friendly home upgrades.","Frank Richter is like the Sherlock Holmes of energy efficiency.

Clients come to him with their problems: a high electric bill, cold floors, a broken water heater. Then, he walks around their homes looking for clues that may not be apparent to the naked eye, like an incandescent lightbulb or a gap in the insulation. To crack a case, he has to figure out where energy is escaping.

“You try to make recommendations based on what they want to do,” Richter said. “And we might discover things that they didn't know they could do, which is the fun part.”

Richter volunteers as a coach with the Monadnock Sustainability Hub, helping people figure out how to save money and cut fossil fuel emissions with home upgrades.

With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest federal climate policy in American history, suddenly there was a lot more money behind those recommendations. Households could use thousands of dollars in expanded tax credits to pay for things like solar panels and heat pumps.

Those tax credits were supposed to last for seven more years. Now, they’re going away at the end of this month, as a result of provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law over the summer.

In response, the Monadnock Sustainability Hub hatched a new plan. If the group was going to meet its goal — to transition their 800-square-mile corner of New Hampshire off fossil fuels — it needed to raise money to help people get electric appliances and switch to renewable energy. The hub started a program called Electrify Monadnock.

“We want to keep the momentum going. People have this bottled up interest in doing all this stuff. They just need to fund it and finance it,” Richter said.

Rachel Ranelli, the hub’s sole employee and a recent college graduate, is the main person responsible for creating this DIY local version of federal climate policy. Since incentives were rolled back, she says there has been less interest in the coaching program.

“We can't rely on the federal government to be making progress towards that goal of reducing our emissions, so we really look at, how can we make change on a local level,” she said.

Scaling down to meet climate goals

The hub has raised more than $350,000 dollars from private donors to create a program that could replace the federal tax credits people had been expecting.

Ranelli has been working on a structure for the program, including how to divvy up the funds, how to process applications, and how to funnel the benefits towards low-income residents. Households will be able to get up to $7,000 in rebates for all kinds of home projects, such as installing solar panels or switching to heat pumps.

Raising money from local donors to address climate change house-by-house might seem like the opposite of efficiency. But Ranelli says even though the hub cannot offer as much money as the federal government did, she’s hoping the fund will make a difference.

“That's, you know, 40 or 50 more houses who are not burning fossil fuels,” she said.

Dori Drachman, the chair of the hub’s board, says one reason she thinks a fund like this will work is because she saw how federal incentives encouraged people to make climate-friendly home upgrades.

The efforts of small communities add up, Drachman says, and can serve as models for other parts of the country.

“We don't have time to wait. We really don't. We have to do something now, which is why we're doing this fund,” she said. “The climate is changing.”

About 30% of the nation’s total greenhouse gas emissions come from heating, cooling, cooking, and keeping the lights on in homes and businesses. Another roughly 30% comes from transportation, including gas-powered cars.

There are some other incentives for homeowners to cut their emissions that aren’t disappearing, like the federally funded rebate programs New Hampshire state officials are still working to stand up. New Hampshire Saves, a program run by the state’s utility companies, also offers incentives for energy-saving upgrades.

But the Trump administration is turning support away from renewable energy and other programs aimed at cutting emissions, in favor of supporting fossil fuel resources like gas, coal, and oil.

“Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth, and the fiscal health of the Nation,” the administration said in a July executive order.

Research shows transitioning to energy efficient electric systems can both cut costs for households and reduce the emissions driving human-caused climate change. According to the International Monetary Fund, subsidies for fossil fuels can have harmful effects on economic growth by inefficiently allocating resources and encouraging pollution.

'A toasty treat'

For Janet Altobello, a client of the hub’s coaching program, having financial and logistical assistance helped her kick-start a transition off fossil fuels she’d been thinking about for a long time.

“We were really excited about the Inflation Reduction Act, of course, and then kind of had to rush to take advantage of the incentives there,” she said. “We have really modest incomes, and we just really have to look at the cash incentives for all these different programs and kind of pace it out gradually.”

Altobello has been working to keep the heat in since the 1970s, when insulation meant wrapping the foundation of a house in black tar paper and piling evergreens on top to keep the wind out. Now, her home exemplifies the many electrification upgrades a house can get.

She added insulation, upgraded the electric panel, and replaced her gas stove with an induction range, which only works with magnetic pots and pans.

“I had this name tag with a magnet on it. And so, I would go to rummage sales and just test pots to see if they were magnetic on the bottom. So, I got some great pots for like $2 each,” she said.

She bought a plug-in hybrid car, and Frank Richter helped her figure out how to charge it — even taking her on a field trip to a public charging station. And she installed heat pumps.

“That is a toasty treat. It's like about a seven minute experience of warming it up and then feeling like, ‘Oh, this is really a luxury,’” she said.

Now, she’s become the go-to person for many of her neighbors who are looking to make changes to their own homes.

Altobello says the whole process of slowly transitioning her home has been relatively painless, but it has been a stretch. She took out a six-year, zero percent interest loan from New Hampshire Saves for part of the work.

“I just feel lucky to be able to do it. I feel like, wow, I have help. I can do this,” she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b086a8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+545/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F7a%2F0c25b6e2444ea59780f77ea0b450%2Fimg-7540.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:13.379164

And 31 states cut staff totals at their environmental agencies, collectively eliminating 3,725 roles in that same period.
“The funding cuts to TCEQ described in this report render the agency largely ineffective, and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness,” she said.
Meanwhile, both houses of Congress are recommending much less severe EPA cuts.
“This report is a warning,” said Jennifer Walling, chief executive officer for the Illinois Environmental Council.","Massive cuts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have hampered state-level regulators’ ability to rein in pollution, according to a new report. And now, with the Trump administration pushing for even deeper cuts at the agency in 2026, many states across the country may be in a dire position.

“If EPA’s capacity to do its job is further diminished, how prepared are our states to shoulder more responsibility for protecting us from these threats? Unfortunately, not well,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP), the nonprofit behind the report, said in a Wednesday press conference on the findings.

The report found that 27 state governments have cut environmental agency funding over the past 15 years, including seven states — Texas, Wyoming, Iowa, Alabama, Connecticut, South Dakota, and Mississippi — that have cut budgets by a third or more. And 31 states cut staff totals at their environmental agencies, collectively eliminating 3,725 roles in that same period.

That leaves them vulnerable to Trump administration changes at the EPA, which has already seen its budget cut 40 percent between 2010 and 2025. In 2025 alone, EPA staffers have left in droves, thanks to mass firings, layoffs, and resignations — as much as 33 percent of its total staff, according to some estimates. Meanwhile, the White House has proposed cutting the agency’s budget by 55 percent in 2026 to $4.2 billion, its lowest level of funding in four decades.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has suggested that states will be able to pick up the slack, describing a vision for the agency that involves giving “power back to states to make their own decisions.” In a March press conference announcing a major deregulation initiative — what he called “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen” — Zeldin fundamentally recast EPA’s mission, outlining a new mandate to “unleash American energy” and “revitalize the American auto industry.”

Protecting Americans from the impacts of industry pollution, he suggested, would instead fall to state agencies, which are “best positioned to work with unique communities and implement laws.”

“In too many instances and across too many administrations, EPA has retained control of implementing many laws from its perch in the nation’s capital,” he said, in an address to the Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit organization representing environmental agency leaders, later that month. “It’s this kind of common sense reform I want to partner with states to achieve.”

In its report, EIP argues that this stance ignores EPA’s statutorily defined mission to protect the health and well-being of Americans, while downplaying the crucial role it plays in outlining national standards and coordinating efforts related to complex, multi-state problems. Even more significantly, though, according to the report, many states are simply not equipped to address their challenges without a strong federal partner.

“This kind of handoff — from federal to state — can only work if the teammate receiving the baton has not been hobbled, as many state environmental agencies have been, by budget cuts,” the report’s authors write.

Twenty three states have in fact worked to increase environmental funding since 2010 — with California (364 percent increase), Colorado (111 percent increase), and Vermont (109 percent increase) leading the way. Which means future cuts to the EPA would likely have a disproportionate impact on states like Mississippi and South Dakota, which have cut agency funding by 71 percent and 61 percent, respectively.

In the Wednesday press conference convened by EIP, environmental advocates painted a broad picture of state-level regulatory dysfunction that would only be made worse by further federal cuts.

The proposed cuts are “a recipe for disaster in states like ours, where the state agency is already stretched thin,” Drew Ball, southeast campaigns director for the National Resources Defense Council of North Carolina, where environmental agency funding had already declined 32 percent since 2010, said at EIP’s news conference.

“It’s like dismantling the fire department while the house is already burning.”

States depend on a variety of EPA grants to help fund their compliance efforts, ensuring that standards under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other laws are met. The Trump administration has proposed cutting EPA “categorical grants” by approximately $1 billion, eliminating nearly all federal funding for a range of issues, from air quality management and pollution control to brownfield management and lead abatement.

That recommendation would “devastate economic development, critical infrastructure, and environmental protections across the nation,” representatives from the Environmental Council of the States wrote in an open letter to Zeldin in May.

In the Wednesday press conference, Kathryn Guerra of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, said her state of Texas already suffers from widespread regulatory noncompliance. According to its own enforcement reports, she said, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) never investigates many of the environmental complaints it receives, while its backlog of unresolved enforcement cases has grown to over 1,400.

“The funding cuts to TCEQ described in this report render the agency largely ineffective, and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness,” she said.

Meanwhile, both houses of Congress are recommending much less severe EPA cuts. The House Appropriations Committee has recommended cutting the agency’s budget by 23 percent in 2026, while its counterpart in the Senate has voted for just a 5 percent reduction. But the advocates convened by EIP argued that current levels of funding are already critically low.

“This report is a warning,” said Jennifer Walling, chief executive officer for the Illinois Environmental Council. “If both lines of defense, our state agencies and the U.S. EPA are weakened at the same time, pollution enforcement will falter, emergencies will happen, and public health will suffer. We cannot pretend that states are prepared to shoulder this burden alone.”",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-CorpusChristie-1024x655-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:06.367569

As of Dec. 1, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. has secured company commitments to add 10,600 new jobs, leaders said.

Those roles are expected to pay an average of $40.59 hourly, up from last year’s $36.09. Incentive spending per job, meanwhile, dropped to $15,485 from the $46,850 expended last year, according to the IEDC.

“Our strategic focus on increasing wages and jobs in Indiana is working,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a news release. “By supporting Indiana companies and the Main Street economy, we’re helping businesses to grow, encouraging more high-wage career opportunities, and creating the next generation of entrepreneurs. All in all, these results will deliver a more robust economy.”

Braun leads the quasi-public agency’s board of directors, which convened Thursday afternoon for its first meeting since releasing the results of a forensic analysis into the activities of IEDC and several partners.

It was also new Chief Administration Officer Alison Grand’s first meeting. She’ll have general counsel duties and serve as one of IEDC’s two ethics officers.

Her role is among changes prompted by the findings, which included lackluster oversight and questionable spending.

IEDC’s nonprofit arm, which previously funneled largely anonymous donations into economic development travel, hasn’t accepted contributions in months. The $1.9 million left in the account will be used to support the agency’s initiatives, said David Fagan, the board’s audit and finance committee chair.

The board has also revamped its conflict of interest policies — with screened members exiting the room for certain projects — and investment policies. Only the full board makes binding votes now, with committees offering recommendations.

“The foundation is firmly in place; 2026 is all going to be about execution,” Commerce Secretary and CEO David Adams said.

That includes a renewed focus on regional economic development.

IEDC has contracted McKinsey & Company to create the guidelines for regional strategic plans. That’s expected to be done this year, Adams said.

The 15 regions will create and submit their plans in the first quarter of next year, and then execute them with state support, according to a slide deck for the meeting.

The agenda also included the approval of changes to investment policies and loans with the Indiana Angel Network Fund. It’s part of Elevate Ventures, one of the “entities of interest” examined in the forensic analysis.

One loan amendment lets IEDC convert the remaining outstanding balance into ownership of the Indiana Angel Network Fund since the loan’s maturity date has passed. The board also approved a new, $5 million loan for the group.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a petition Monday asking state regulators to reconsider rules they approved last month for serving data centers. She argues the terms are too weak and could stick ordinary customers with the bill if these massive energy users don't cover their costs.

Consumers Energy responded Thursday, calling Nessel's challenge baseless and accusing her of opposing economic growth that would bring jobs and tax revenue to Michigan.

The clash stems from a November order from the Michigan Public Service Commission that set guidelines for businesses using at least 100 megawatts of electricity, roughly enough to power 80,000 homes. Currently, Consumers Energy only serves one customer of that magnitude. However, with a boom in data centers across the country as artificial intelligence (AI) grows, many officials are hoping to bring them here.

What Nessel Wants Changed

Nessel is asking regulators to require stricter terms for the businesses:

Longer contracts: 20 years instead of 15 years

Higher guaranteed payments: 90% minimum billing instead of 80%

Lower size threshold: 50 megawatts instead of 100 megawatts

Public review process: Contested hearings instead of private applications

In her 17-page petition, Nessel argues the commission ignored her cost analysis showing that under current terms, a 100-megawatt customer could leave other ratepayers with an $80 million shortfall.

""The Commission's Order presents arbitrary and capricious analysis,"" Nessel wrote, adding that the approved terms set ""unnecessarily less-protective"" standards that other utilities are already copying.

She also wants explicit requirements that large customers cover their share of Michigan's renewable energy mandates, which currently require utilities to get 60% of their power from clean sources by 2035.

Consumers Energy's Response

The utility fired back Wednesday, saying the commission's order already protects customers while allowing Michigan to compete for business investment.

""The attorney general's challenge has no merit,"" said Kelly Hall, Consumers Energy's senior vice president of regulatory and legal affairs. ""The MPSC's order last month creates a useful framework as Michigan grows and attracts new jobs and tax revenue for local communities.""

Lauren Snyder, the company's senior vice president and chief customer officer, went further, calling Nessel's position ""anti-investment.""

""When businesses grow, families have more choices — better jobs, stronger schools, and thriving communities where people want to live and stay,"" Snyder said.

Consumers Energy argues that large customers will actually help reduce costs for everyone by spreading the utility's fixed expenses across more users. The company said these customers will ""pay their full cost of service.""

What the Current Rules Require

Under the commission's November order, large energy users must:

Sign 15-year contracts with automatic five-year extensions

Pay for at least 80% of their contracted energy regardless of actual use

Pay exit fees if they leave early

Post collateral equal to half their potential exit fee

The commission also said it would review applications for new large customers individually to ensure they don't shift costs to other ratepayers.

What Happens Next

The Michigan Public Service Commission will decide whether to grant Nessel's request for a rehearing. The dispute comes as Michigan competes with other states to attract data centers, which require massive amounts of electricity to power servers that store and process digital information.

Nessel is also currently opposing the speed at which a proposed data center project in Saline Township is being moved forward. In early December, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced her support of the proposed data center, saying ""time is of the essence."" Nessel responded to the proposal as well, urging the MPSC to slow down and hold full, contested hearings on the project.",https://media.wzzm13.com/assets/WZZM/images/c743c916-6394-40f8-baa6-dbfcda98aa89/20251211T221944/c743c916-6394-40f8-baa6-dbfcda98aa89_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:02:46.335559

I see that same fire burning across North Carolina right now.","(Raleigh, NC – December 12, 2025) For many advocates across North Carolina, this year, and especially these last few weeks, has been emotionally shattering. ICE raids have returned to communities that have already lived through a decade of fear. Families are once again creating emergency plans for the worst-case scenario. Communities are canceling medical appointments, skipping work, and not taking their children to school. The fear is loud. And the silence is even louder.

As the daughter of immigrants, the scapegoating we are witnessing is not new. History is repeating itself, again, and the familiar narrative has returned: blame immigrants for every systemic failure in this country. I have spent these weeks supporting families who remind me so much of my own, and the weight of memory sits heavy. I know too well what it means to live in the shadows. To move in silence. To hope that if you stand still enough, maybe the world won’t notice you.

My own family’s journey is a reminder of how fragile safety can be. Under the previous Trump administration, my mother lived undocumented in rural North Carolina, and every knock at the door felt like a threat that could change our lives forever. Today, she is a U.S. citizen. That transformation should feel like a triumph. But the truth is, even citizenship does not erase the trauma, exhaustion, and vigilance that immigrant families carry. Right now, the fear persists for one painful, clear reason: it does not matter if you are a U.S. citizen. ICE has shown, repeatedly, that citizenship does not protect you from racial profiling. We’ve seen them target anyone with brown skin, arresting first and asking questions later.

But, in the past three weeks, I have seen something extraordinary, something beautiful rising out of the chaos. The raids have awakened a sleeping giant. People who once felt untouched by policy decisions are realizing that no one is far beyond reach. From public education to Medicaid access to the rising cost of living, people across North Carolina are feeling the consequences of policy choices they were told would “restore order.” But instead of shrinking back, people, especially young people, are standing up.

What gives me hope?

It’s the walkouts spreading across the country. It’s the teenagers in Wilson County who are making protest signs on a Tuesday afternoon. It’s the look on their faces when they realize they are fighting for something bigger than themselves. As I watched them, one of them asked me, “Are you okay? You look uncomfortable.” And, at that moment, I understood why.

When I was their age, I held my first protest sign begging this country to see my undocumented mother as a human being. I begged for safety. For acceptance. For the right to exist in the only home I had ever known. I never imagined I would see young people, almost a decade later, fighting a different version of the same battle.

It was like watching a circle close, one I never wanted them to inherit. And yet… they are lifting their voices. They are demanding change. They are refusing to disappear.

Their courage gives me hope because they are not just protesting; they are organizing. They understand something powerful: real safety is not created by fear-based policies. It is built by community power. And across North Carolina, that power is growing.

From rural towns to urban centers, we are seeing neighbors step up to learn their rights, volunteers joining rapid response networks, families challenging unjust detentions, and local leaders pushing back on policies that make our communities less safe. We are also watching coalitions deepen between immigrant communities, Black-led organizations, educators, and faith leaders. These relationships, these bridges, are the true infrastructure of collective safety.

The work ahead is hard. The gaps exposed by the raids: legal support, language access, transportation, mutual aid, childcare, accurate information, crisis response, trauma-informed care, among many others require more resources, deeper coordination, and political courage from those in power. We need policies that invest in community well-being rather than criminalization: expanded funding for legal defense, true sanctuary policies at the local level, higher wages so people can afford the basics, stronger protections for tenants, and access to healthcare regardless of immigration status. These are not radical ideas. They are necessary ones.

But despite the uncertainty, I remain hopeful, not because things are easy, but because I’m watching the next generation rise with clarity and conviction.

They remind me of the fire I once carried before too many defeats dimmed it.

I see that same fire burning across North Carolina right now. In Wilson, where history is shifting as we elect our first Latine leader to public office. In rural towns, where local leaders are mobilizing to build the infrastructure their communities need, not just for this moment, but for the future they deserve. In the coalitions of solidarity forming across counties and cultures. In the families who refuse to disappear. And in the young people who refuse to inherit silence.

Hope lives there.

And as long as we keep building power, across communities, across languages, across counties, the shadows will never be able to swallow us again.",https://www.ncjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7193.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 20:00:30.978573

Between July 2017 and April 2018, the Atlantic economy created more than 16,000 jobs. Employment grew 1.5 per cent, better than the national average of 0.9 per cent. During this period, almost 11,000 jobs were created in services producing sectors, mainly in accommodation and food services, and over 5,000 in goods-producing sectors, mainly in the construction sector. Jobs created in Atlantic Canada during this period were full-time jobs, which grew by 2.4 per cent in the region, compared to 1.7 per cent nationally. Part-time jobs in the region have decreased by 2.9 per cent since July 2017. The region has also welcomed over 9,000 permanent residents and their families in 2017 under economic programs. With new dedicated support for businesses offered by the Atlantic Immigration Pilot, regional employers made nearly 1,800 job offers since 2017 to fill job vacancies using the Pilot Program, compared to over 250 job offers in the previous year. Through the Student Work Placement Program, a partnership between Venture for Canada, governments, post-secondary institutions and employers was created to provide more than 500 Canadian students across Atlantic Canada with valuable work experience and work-ready skills in business and entrepreneurial fields.

A new Ocean Supercluster, under development, will support growth of the ocean economy in Atlantic Canada and across the country. This initiative is projected to create more than 3,000 jobs and add more than $14 billion to Canada's economy over 10 years. Enrolment in the Accelerated Growth Service nearly doubled in the past year, with 29 new Atlantic Canadian high-growth companies signing up to receive customized support to grow their market potential - increasing total enrolment in the service to 68 companies. Through the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), more than $140 million has been invested in innovative companies working in information and communication technology, agri-food, ocean technology and tourism. With new training tools developed by not-for-profits and governments, Atlantic Canadian companies can access more market intelligence and resources to better use data, as well as participate in workshops to create healthy business cultures.

The Atlantic Growth Strategy's initiatives are making companies and communities more sustainable and able to mitigate climate change. Initiatives under the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change support efforts to meet emissions reduction targets, grow the economy, and build resilience to a changing climate. These initiatives include $185 million allocated to Atlantic Canadian provinces through the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund and the creation of the new Clean Growth Hub, launched in January 2018, which has already helped 30 Atlantic Canadian companies to access federal clean technology programs, funding and services. Innovative projects such as smart electricity grids in the City of Summerside and the University of New Brunswick are demonstrating new ways to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and improve reliability of energy sources.

Trade and tourism are a vital part of the Atlantic Canadian economy and both have experienced growth over the past few years. There were nearly 70 more exporters in our region in 2017 compared to 2016Footnote 1. Exports from Atlantic Canada were valued at $30 billion in 2017, an increase of 16 per cent between 2016 and 2017Footnote 2. Since the launch of the Atlantic Trade and Investment Growth Strategy in July 2017, partners have been organizing pan-Atlantic initiatives dedicated to international market engagement, including 17 trade missions involving more than 300 participants to countries like China, Europe and the United States. Tourism, meanwhile, is estimated to contribute more than $5 billion annually to the Atlantic Canadian economy. A new pan-Atlantic tourism approach, also announced in July 2017, provides new tools for hundreds of exporters in the tourism industry and promotes the region as a world-class tourism destination. This approach includes the region's largest ever media campaign in China, which builds on the 2018 Canada-China Year of Tourism. Indigenous tourism experiences offer a unique opportunity to showcase and share the rich history, culture and tradition of communities across the East Coast. An Atlantic chapter of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada was created, which creates a framework for future development in the region.

The federal government, along with the four provincial governments, is supporting the region's infrastructure in an effort to foster long-term economic growth and make communities more inclusive. In July 2017, the Government of Canada announced that over $2.4 billion would be allocated through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to the Atlantic provinces over the next decade for infrastructure projects, a record level of investment. Funding will be provided through integrated bilateral agreements between Infrastructure Canada and each province. This funding builds on $339 million for short-term investments to maintain and repair local infrastructure through Phase 1 of the Investing in Canada Plan, outlined in last year's report.

More than 130 communities across two Atlantic provinces will benefit from upwards of $66 million invested through the federal Connect to Innovate and provincial funding programs, with further investments expected throughout 2018. In addition, the Connecting Canadians Program completed eight of 13 projects across Atlantic Canada. These projects will help Atlantic Canadians take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the digital age.

The Atlantic Growth Strategy's accomplishments have required a high level of collaboration from all partners, coordinated and targeted investments and a clear vision for Atlantic Canada. Through the Strategy, the governments of Canada and the Atlantic provinces are committed to keep working collaboratively to advance common priorities for the long-term benefit of the Atlantic economy, including on broadband, skills and immigration in the near-term.

What have we done so far?

Strong federal-provincial collaboration is the hallmark of the Atlantic Growth Strategy as it continues to help create stable, good-paying jobs for Atlantic Canadians. The Strategy helps provide businesses with the tools they need to increase exports, innovate in traditional industries vital to the region's communities, as well as attract and retain skilled workers.

Thanks to the Atlantic Growth Strategy's initiatives to date, a strong foundation has been laid to enable established industries like agriculture, agri-food, fisheries, aquaculture and tourism – as well as emerging industries like clean technology – to innovate and successfully compete in global markets. At the same time, small- and medium-sized businesses are getting the support they need to capitalize on new technologies, attract skilled workers, scale up operations and pursue new export opportunities.

We are also deepening our understanding of the issues facing the region through consultations, best practices and research, including the final report from the Atlantic Growth Advisory Group. The Advisory Group provided their strategic advice and recommendations to help guide the region's collaborative approaches and actions moving forward. New collaborative work has been identified in important areas such as broadband, Indigenous tourism and the development of an export accelerator to help small and medium enterprises access the essential skills, competencies and connections they need to compete on the global stage. Using these tools, the governments of Canada and the Atlantic provinces are tailoring their approaches to maximize benefits for the region.

Together these actions have helped the Strategy's longer-term outcomes for each of the five strategic priorities for the region.

Since the July 2017 report on results, the Atlantic Growth Strategy has made progress on the following priorities:

Skilled Workforce and Immigration

Longer-Term Outcome: Admit up to 7,000 additional newcomers to the region by 2020

We are seeing positive results under the three-year Atlantic Immigration Pilot.

This federal and provincial pilot program is helping to attract and retain skilled workers and international graduates in Atlantic Canada. All partners have worked diligently to promote the pilot across the region with more than 700 outreach activities completed, targeting a variety of audiences.

Since the Pilot began accepting applications in March 2017, more Atlantic employers are seeing the potential of immigration to fill labour market needs that cannot be met locally. Atlantic employers have made nearly 1,800 job offers to applicants under the Atlantic Intermediate-Skilled Program, the Atlantic High-Skilled Program, and the Atlantic International Graduate Program to fill job vacancies. That's a considerable increase from the 250 job offers made at this time last year.

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada launched the Dedicated Service Channel.

Since July 2017, designated employers under the Atlantic Immigration Pilot are receiving personalized support from the Dedicated Service Channel in navigating the process of hiring foreign talent as well as receiving tips and associated guidance on strategies for success following recruitment. More than 200 employers are currently benefitting from these services.

We increased support to Settlement Service Provider Organizations.

Settlement Service Provider Organizations have provided more than 2,100 needs assessments and settlement plans to the Atlantic Immigration Pilot's principal applicants and their accompanying family members in an effort to help families settle in communities across the Atlantic region.

We are promoting the region as a destination of choice for international students and graduates.

The Atlantic provincial governments, with support from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), are expanding the model of EduNova's Study and Stay Program throughout the region to attract and retain international students. The model is being adapted to meet the specific needs of each province and complement existing service offerings. EduNova's Study and Stay program attracted close to 50 international students from China, India and the Philippines and is helping integrate them into their communities and transition to the workforce.

We are providing youth with work integrated learning opportunities.

In Atlantic Canada, a $4.4 million partnership was announced with Venture for Canada, in collaboration with post-secondary institutions and employers, to provide 505 Canadian students across the region with valuable work experience and work-ready skills in business and entrepreneurial fields. Students who participate in these opportunities develop technical and work-ready skills sought after by employers; they are more likely to benefit from greater employment opportunities, be employed in fields more closely related to their studies, and receive higher earnings.

We are helping address skill shortages.

Led by the Council of Atlantic Premiers' Atlantic Workforce Partnership and supported by Employment and Social Development Canada, the Atlantic Apprenticeship Harmonization Project (AAHP) is helping increase apprenticeship completion rates and keeping apprentices in Atlantic Canada. To date, the AAHP has enabled the harmonization of 10 trade occupations and the development and implementation of a new common information technology (IT) system to track apprenticeship certification. By February 2019, an additional six trades will be harmonized and the IT system will be completed.

Once completed, provinces will begin to migrate information from their current IT systems to the new platform. In total, 16 Red Seal trades will be harmonized across Atlantic provinces, thanks to new federal and provincial investments. There are currently approximately 15,000 apprentices in Atlantic Canada and it is expected that all apprentices will be registered in the new IT system by 2020.

Skilled Workforce and Immigration: Real-life Results

I would absolutely recommend the AIP to other employers.

Mike Albert, Cirrus Garments, Saint John, NB

Metamaterial Technologies Inc. (NS) uses innovative technology and advanced manufacturing to develop smart protective materials. The company's Canadian workforce includes global talent representing 15 countries and speaking more than 20 different languages. Metamaterial Technologies is using the Atlantic Immigration Pilot to hire highly skilled experts from around the world. The company is also part of the Accelerated Growth Service and housed at Innovacorp, a Nova Scotia business incubator and accelerator.

Metamaterials are a relatively new scientific field and the work we are doing in laser protection has never been done before. These are exciting times for science and this funding will help us as we move to the next stage of growth, allowing us to advance our manufacturing capacity to produce these new smart material products.

Dr. George Palikaras, Founder and CEO, Metamaterial Technologies Inc.

The Association for New Canadians (NL) helps employers and newcomers and their families through the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program's designation, endorsement and post-arrival processes. Increased settlement services in rural regions will support economic growth, as well as improve retention rates and address persistent and emerging labour market needs. More than $1.2 million was invested in this initiative by the Government of Canada and the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

We have a very close relationship with the (provincial) Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism as well as with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada. We want to help both governments make Atlantic Canada a destination of choice for newcomers and immigrants, and make them comfortable by letting them know that they can set up roots here in the province, and that we will be there to help them make a go of it.

Kip Bonnell, Association for New Canadians

The New Conversations Tour (NB), organized by the New Brunswick Multicultural Council, is a series of 15 community events with two prominent New Brunswick economists. The New Conversations Tour was established to promote awareness of emerging shortages of skilled workers. It is also designed to facilitate more inclusive communities by providing the impetus for discussions on how to attract and keep workers. Events engage local stakeholders in discussions of labour force trends in New Brunswick and the critical need to address population decline through retention, repatriation, and immigration. The events have gathered more than 1,200 individuals so far.

Somru Bioscience (PEI) is a biotechnology company founded in 2012 that develops antibody technology to accelerate the drug development process. The company's vice-president and co-founder, Mohammed Moin, immigrated to PEI on a student visa in 2000. The company currently exports to more than 20 countries and is in the midst of a major expansion. A new joint venture for a diagnostic laboratory in Bangladesh is expected to generate $50 million in export sales over the next five years and add 100 new employees to the company's PEI operations. Somru is hiring two senior scientists using the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program to augment local recruiting.

A number of our employees do come through an immigration process. The AIP has been a benefit in a number of ways for us. Having the support at the provincial and the federal levels for permanent residency has been great. Diversity is something that we value here. We seek out opportunities to look at things differently, to approach things in a different way and diversity really allows us to do that.

Marcia Snow, Citco

Without the AIP, there would be no potential growth for us here. I would absolutely recommend the AIP to other employers, because finding skilled workers in many industries in Canada is getting more difficult and it is a way for our nation to grow its economic development. Without immigration it seems like a lot of industries are going to find challenges in getting new employees.

Mike Albert, Cirrus Garments

I am so pleased that I was told about IRCC's Dedicated Service Channel. My account manager has been instrumental in helping me understand the confusing aspects of hiring foreign workers. I frequently call or email him, and he's always friendly and answers my questions in a timely fashion. Knowing I can reach my account manager at any time, with any question or concern is a big relief for me and my employees.

Shaun McBride, The Learning Bar

We support newcomers by making sure that we work out a settlement plan with them based on their needs. Then we supply the employers with that settlement plan. We're also there for the follow up, so if the employer calls with questions or situations that they're not quite sure how to deal with, we can provide them with some advice and assistance.

Craig Mackie, PEI Association for Newcomers to Canada

Innovation

Longer-Term Outcome: Double the number of high-growth firms in Atlantic Canada by 2025

We are promoting innovation, technology adoption and advanced manufacturing.

With support from partners, Atlantic Canadian companies are investing in advanced equipment, in part to cope with a tightening labour supply. This trend supports productivity improvement and greater export competitiveness.

We are supporting regional clusters of innovation.

In February 2018, the Ocean Supercluster, led by the Atlantic region, was successful in its bid under ISED's Innovative Supercluster Initiative. This initiative will leverage the combined strengths of the industries operating in Canada's oceans. It is projected that this supercluster will create more than 3,000 jobs and add more than $14 billion to Canada's gross domestic product over 10 years. Governments, industries and stakeholders in Atlantic Canada continue to find ways to enhance collaboration in strategic sectors of our economy, including oceans, food and our clean technology companies.

We are enhancing the Accelerated Growth Service in Atlantic Canada.

This service provides customized support in areas such as financing, exporting, and advisory and innovation services to Atlantic companies with high-growth potential. The Atlantic provinces and the Government of Canada signed an agreement to enhance collaboration and create a more streamlined process for companies.

Between July 2017 and July 2018, 29 new Atlantic Canadian companies signed up for the service - nearly double the number that had signed up in the previous year. The total enrolment of 68 companies exceeds the region's target of 60 companies after two years. Ninety companies are expected to go through the service by 2019.

We are helping business incubators and accelerators launch and grow new start-ups.

Atlantic Canadian firms drive innovation activity in the region to promote long-term economic growth. There are more than 400 start-ups across the region, an increase of nearly 60 per cent since 2014. A number of regional incubators and accelerators are supporting this dynamic start-up culture. In an effort to grow employment and revenues, partners are developing a new strategy that builds on success factors and identifies investment priorities.

We are supporting research and innovation in areas such as biosciences, aquaculture, ocean technology, renewable energy, fisheries, agriculture and forestry.

Complementing the Atlantic Growth Strategy, entrepreneurs in Atlantic Canada received more than $140 million in financing in the first year of a two-year $280 million financing package. This package, launched by the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), aims to assist the region's small and mid-sized businesses pursuing growth in information and communication technology, agri-food, ocean technology and tourism.

BDC's $280 million financing commitment for Atlantic Canada represented a $100 million increase in the bank's normal lending volume for the targeted industries.

We are investing more than $400 million through the Atlantic Fisheries Fund to strengthen our fish and seafood sector.

Open for applications since August 2017, the Atlantic Fisheries Fund is helping advance a more sustainable and prosperous fish and seafood sector focused on innovation, infrastructure and science partnerships. This fund is driving innovation in Atlantic Canada's fish and seafood sector to better meet market demands for sustainably sourced, high quality fish and seafood products, and to address the challenges posed by changing oceanographic conditions.

We are finding new ways to support Atlantic Canada's food sector.

Through a federal-provincial working group on food, the governments of Canada and the Atlantic provinces are working with industry to identify ways to leverage strategic opportunities in our region's food sector. The region is ripe with opportunities to share its high quality and sustainable goods with the country and the rest of the world.

We are building awareness of the potential of big data analytics.

We trained 100 federal and provincial staff on big data analytics, which will help staff work with clients to identify opportunities for the use of data analytics in their businesses. These opportunities could include enhancing productivity, making better decisions and/or developing new products and markets. This training will also help staff to refer clients to the appropriate support services for their big data analytics projects.

As a result of this work, 15 Atlantic companies to date have been linked to the National Research Council Data Analytics Centre.

We are working with stakeholders to determine the cultural dimensions of success.

Our partners have conducted an in-depth analysis of business culture and organized an intensive Innovation Lab with business leaders and other key representatives from government, academia and the not-for-profit community. These insights will help tailor our support for Atlantic businesses. We explored attitudes, behaviours and perceptions that affect business growth, innovation and productivity in Atlantic Canada.

We are encouraging opportunities for youth to learn digital skills.

The CanCode Program will invest $50 million across Canada over two years to support initiatives providing opportunities for coding and digital skills development to Canadian youth from kindergarten to grade 12, including $2 million for two Atlantic-led projects. The program helps students and teachers acquire skills and knowledge through coding and digital skills experiences.

Innovation: Real-life Results

VoltaCohort competitions led by Volta Labs of Halifax, Nova Scotia, have led to $250,000 in strategic investments for 10 early-stage high-calibre Atlantic Canadian start-ups to fuel their growth and success.

Clean Growth and Climate Change

Longer-Term Outcome: Reduce GHG emissions

We covered a lot of ground since launching the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change.

The Pan-Canadian Framework outlines more than 50 concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, help the region adapt and become more resilient to the impacts of a changing climate, foster clean technology solutions, and create good jobs that contribute to a stronger economy.

In its first year of implementation, federal, provincial and territorial governments have made good progress in starting to put the framework into action. Work is underway to ensure that carbon pricing systems are in place across Canada by January 1, 2019. Governments are also implementing new policies, programs and regulations to reduce emissions in every sector of the economy, support communities in adapting to a changing climate, and invest in clean technologies.

We are investing more than $185 million in Atlantic Canada through the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund.

Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have each leveraged at least $50 million in federal funding to support energy efficiency upgrades in buildings across their provinces. In particular, programming in both provinces is being expanded to allow homeowners who heat their homes with fuel oil to access funding for home retrofits. In Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, several significant opportunities to support clean growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, will be funded with support from the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund.

We are investing in Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure, across Canada.

For example in 2017, the federal government provided $1.6 million for the installation of electric vehicle fast charging stations in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, through phase 1 of the Electric Vehicle and Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Deployment initiative.

We are serving companies and other stakeholders through the Clean Growth Hub.

The newly created Clean Growth Hub is connecting Atlantic-based companies and other stakeholders to the various supports for clean technology across government. So far, more than 500 companies and industry stakeholders have worked with the Hub, including 30 Atlantic Canadian organizations working to advance their clean technologies.

In addition to the Hub, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, which provides funding for Canadian clean technology projects, also has a presence in Atlantic Canada to provide expertise in the fields of sustainable development, finance and technology investment to help Atlantic Canadian companies move their ground-breaking technologies to market.

We are continuing to advance work on regional electricity grids and renewable power generation.

Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), working together with the Governments of the Atlantic Provinces and their electric utilities, and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, finalized an initial study under the Regional Electricity Cooperation and Strategic Infrastructure initiative that identifies the most promising electricity infrastructure projects that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Atlantic Canada. The study identifies reinforcement of the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick transmission intertie as a promising project for transitioning Atlantic Canada to clean electricity.

NRCan is currently working with the governments of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and their electric utilities to assess the costs and benefits of the project to the two jurisdictions, with a view toward advancing this important infrastructure project.

We are protecting Atlantic Canada's forests from the damaging effects of a spruce budworm outbreak.

Through Budget 2018, the Government of Canada proposed to take action alongside the Governments of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the forest industry, by providing up to $74 million over four years and $750,000 ongoing, to prevent the spread of spruce budworm and the associated socio-economic and environmental impacts of an outbreak.

Co-sponsored by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Phase II of the Early Intervention Strategy for Spruce Budworm research program supports the Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, as tree mortality caused by an outbreak will negatively affect greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts. Preventing an outbreak and protecting Atlantic Canada's forest resource will also ensure that forestry remains a vital driver of the region's economy and a source of jobs and opportunities.

Trade and Investment

Longer-Term Outcome: Double the number of exporters in Atlantic Canada by 2025

We are implementing the multi-year, international Atlantic Trade and Investment Growth Strategy, supported by a $20 million funding agreement.

The Atlantic Trade and Investment Growth Strategy, announced in July 2017, supports joint trade and investment initiatives that are coordinated, firm-focused, and built on the region's sector capabilities and capacity.

Since 2017, pan-Atlantic initiatives (in addition to bilateral and unilateral initiatives) dedicated to international market engagements included 17 trade missions, involving more than 300 participants.

We are growing awareness of export opportunities to Europe.

The recent Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement is creating significant opportunities for our region.

To prepare for these opportunities, we organized two multi-sector trade missions to the European Union with Atlantic Canadian companies in June and November 2017. These trade missions resulted in more than 139 qualified sales leads and 63 potential sales deals reported by participants.

Partners also held a Canada-Europe Trade Agreement Roadshow to generate awareness of the European market. These sessions drew in approximately 320 business participants from across all four Atlantic provinces.

We are providing the tools to support our current and future exporters.

LearnSphere's bilingual Export Market Access Program (EMAP) and E-Tools for Exporting (E for E), which saw investments of $3 million, help firms develop and expand their sales to international markets.

As of April 30, 2018, these programs provided support for nearly 130 companies and almost half of them were new exporters. LearnSphere will help more than 180 companies across Atlantic Canada reach their export goals by the end of 2018 through the EMAP and E for E programs.

We are preparing an Atlantic Growth Strategy joint trade mission to China.

China is Canada's second largest trading partner after the United States.

This multi-sectoral trade and investment mission will take place in November 2018. It will support Atlantic Canadian businesses and organizations in the food, clean growth, education and tourism sectors that are looking to create new partnerships and build business-to-business relationships in China. It will also capitalize on the 2018 Canada-China Year of Tourism.

We hosted Rendez-Vous Canada, Canada's premier international tourism marketplace.

Held in Halifax, Nova Scotia over four days, it brought together more than 1,900 tourism professionals to promote or discover unique Canadian experiences, particularly those showcasing national priority products such as Indigenous and culinary tourism. The event has the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for Canadian tourism businesses and was supported by the new Atlantic Canada Tourism Strategy, announced in July 2017.

We are implementing a strategic and collaborative approach to tourism.

The strategy includes $24.5 million in federal-provincial-industry investments for three initiatives aimed at positioning Atlantic Canada as a top destination in the global tourism sector, creating more jobs for Atlantic Canadians and giving a boost to small businesses. More than 120 Atlantic Canada tourism stakeholders were trained through the Atlantic Growth Strategy Travel Trade Market Readiness Program with a series of webinars and workshops on how to work with international travel trade. The Tourism International Market Expansion Program is supporting the Government of Canada's target of doubling Chinese visitation to Canada by 2021.

We are supporting Indigenous tourism in Atlantic Canada.

The Atlantic chapter of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada was created in June 2017 to build a framework for future development in the region.

We are also supporting the development of tourism strategies and products in communities that wish to pursue tourism as an economic driver. For example, a delegation of Nova Scotia First Nations participated in Edge of the Wedge in November 2017, Canada's premier experiential travel training program led by the Gros Morne Institute of Sustainable Tourism. The program is hosted at the Gros Morne National Park in Newfoundland and Labrador, a leading center of expertise in experiential tourism.

We continue to implement the Collaborative Procurement Initiative across all four Atlantic Provinces with over 20 Municipalities, Academic Institutions and School Boards now participating in Atlantic Canada.

The initiative enables partners, including provincial governments, municipalities, academic institutions, school boards, and hospitals, to leverage Public Services and Procurement Canada's federal instruments and buying power to procure goods and services to obtain better value for money.

With over $200 billion spent annually on public procurement in Canada, this initiative provides opportunities to save taxpayers' money, negotiate better terms and conditions, reduce administrative costs, simplify processes, make it easier for businesses to sell to multiple levels of government, and to expand their market. In addition to reducing costs, federal procurement instruments help to support the use of clean and sustainable goods and services.

So far, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have been able to save more than 30 per cent on the cost of emergency radios and environmental office paper when using federal tools, while negotiating better terms and conditions from suppliers. For example, a locally owned business (Covey Basics) is providing office supplies to the Province of Prince Edward Island, who is receiving better value.

With the introduction of a Canadian Collaborative Procurement Plan in December 2017, more of these success stories are expected.

Infrastructure

Longer-Term Outcome: Bring rural and remote areas online by 2025

We are building better infrastructure in Atlantic Canada that will support growth, and engage and connect people.

Building on nearly $339 million from Budget 2016 for short-term investments to maintain and repair local infrastructure in the region, the Atlantic provinces will see more than $2.4 billion over the next decade for infrastructure projects.

In addition, 28 municipalities across Atlantic Canada applied to the Smart Cities Challenge. These municipalities proposed innovative solutions addressing local issues by leveraging new partnerships, data and connected technology. The Saint Mary's First Nation, the City of Fredericton and the Town of Bridgewater are among the 20 Smart Cities Challenge finalists.

Additional opportunities to spur innovation will be offered by the Canada Infrastructure Bank, to help build projects based on public-private sector partnerships.

We are helping enhance broadband access across the region.

Together, the Atlantic provinces and the Government of Canada announced total investments of more than $66 million through the federal Connect to Innovate and provincial funding programs in two Atlantic provinces. More than 130 communities will benefit from these announcements, which are expected to continue throughout 2018.

In addition, the Connecting Canadians Program completed eight of 13 projects across Atlantic Canada. These projects will help residents connect with family and friends, do business online, participate in distance education and take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the digital age.

We are enhancing and modernizing research and commercialization facilities.

The Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund is supporting 27 projects in Atlantic Canada, with a $152.5 million federal investment, to enhance and modernize facilities for research, commercialization and training at post-secondary institutions.

The LEAPS project portfolio reads like a field guide to practical energy solutions.
In Arizona, the broad partnership with the Hopi Tribe is an exemplar of locally led, culturally aware electrification that is supported by LEAPS technical assistance.
“It equips people with the skills and leadership needed to deliver the energy solutions where they’re needed most.” Johnson is blunt about the scale and urgency required to meet future energy needs.
As LEAPS turns 10, its message is part technical, part civic: Clean, resilient energy is possible when universities turn ideas into solutions.","Nathan Johnson doesn't mince words when it comes to Earth's energy requirements.

“The world needs every electron it can get to match the accelerated pace of economic development and electrification,” says Johnson, a professor of engineering in The Polytechnic School, part of the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University. “In the United States, meeting that surge won’t come from a single technology, business model or policy.”

That insight is both the organizing idea and the challenge facing the next decade. With data-center growth, the electrification of industry, the rise of artificial intelligence and onshoring of manufacturing, U.S. electricity demand is set to climb steeply in the next 10 years. This trend is advancing even faster in other countries.

The future will require practical, scalable solutions that knit together power generation, storage, smarter grids, workforce development and finance. That’s exactly the work ASU’s Laboratory for Energy And Power Solutions, or LEAPS, has been dedicated to for the last decade.

The LEAPS pitch is simple and urgent: translate university innovations into real infrastructure and the workforce at scale. The lab’s 10-year report shows $332 million mobilized, 161 megawatts of clean capacity-enabled and reliable power for over 100,000 people. The team also also trained thousands of workers across the energy sector and government.

Those headline numbers aren’t theory. They are evidence that the lab’s solutions and extension services model can deliver infrastructure, policy advice and trained people where it matters most.

The LEAPS project portfolio reads like a field guide to practical energy solutions. In Arizona, the broad partnership with the Hopi Tribe is an exemplar of locally led, culturally aware electrification that is supported by LEAPS technical assistance.

The Hopi face a persistent lack of access to energy. Even grid-connected homes experience a higher-than-normal number of outages due to dated infrastructure. LEAPS is working with the tribe and local partners to change that by bringing solar energy to homes and community spaces, strengthening power lines to make them more reliable, installing microgrids and training Hopi residents to maintain and manage these new systems. The project also builds lasting partnerships between the tribe, utilities, universities and local businesses to support energy independence and create long-term jobs for Hopi people.

The partnership encompasses several projects with technical and community-driven design. James Nelson, director of technology and innovation for LEAPS, notes that the work explicitly links energy access to job creation for a community hit hard by the closure of coal facilities.

“The project delivers cost-effective, reliable and locally managed power to Hopi households,” Nelson says. “By bringing electricity where no other options exist, we’re supporting energy sovereignty, economic opportunity and long-term resilience for the Hopi Tribe.”

Globally, LEAPS applies the same modular, partnership-driven playbook. In Fiji, the LEAPS team worked with the government to assess and prepare 75 sites for mini-grid power systems. Their work laid the foundation for about $40 million in upcoming construction projects and created new training opportunities to build a skilled clean energy workforce across the South Pacific.

In Madagascar, LEAPS helped produce an integrated energy plan that maps clean cooking and electrification pathways with prioritized investments that can reach universal access by 2030.

In Kenya, technical assistance and business coaching helped women-led energy firms scale, producing an estimated 14,000 new systems and a 48-fold multiplier of private follow-on capital. Across refugee relief, microgrid pilot projects, military resilience programs and municipal microgrid studies, LEAPS emphasizes deployable designs, local ownership models and measurable returns on capital.

What distinguishes LEAPS is a focus on scalable project development and a technical assistance model that amplifies finance.

“We’ve built a model where every dollar LEAPS spends attracts $10 to $50 more,” Johnson says. “That’s how you turn good ideas into large-scale impact.”

The lab’s teams do the engineering, shape business models, work with regulators and utilities, and then test systems — often using the lab’s Grid Modernization Proving Grounds and a mobile training trailer — so private and public partners can move quickly from pilot to procurement to construction.

This is how LEAPS turns pilots into programs: standardize the technical solution, reduce procurement risk, train operators and managers locally, and create financing structures that make projects investable.

One project paid for itself in just 18 months by using smart energy management to make better use of existing infrastructure instead of installing new capital assets.

LEAPS is also a campus-to-community engine. The lab has engaged over 300 students directly in projects and provided hands-on training and internships that translate classroom curiosity into career paths.

“Our microgrid proving grounds give people hands-on experience with real power assets,” Johnson says. “Most students come in with curiosity and passion. Our job is to pair that energy with opportunity and give them options to explore where they want to best fit in the energy economy.”

Alexander Mobley, associate director of technology evaluation and workforce development, explains that LEAPS runs professional courses that reach utility executives, U.S. Department of War personnel and frontline technicians, building the human capital needed to implement the technical solutions they design.

“Training isn’t an afterthought; it’s the foundation of our work,” Mobley says. “It equips people with the skills and leadership needed to deliver the energy solutions where they’re needed most.”

Johnson is blunt about the scale and urgency required to meet future energy needs.

“What the U.S. built in the last 100 years needs to be built again in the next 10. But we don’t have the people, materials or policies to do it the same way.”

The implication is not nostalgia for old infrastructure, but a call to do more with smarter designs, match demand to clean generation, tighten asset utilization and avoid the inefficiencies of overbuilding. That’s the pragmatic, all-of-the-above stance LEAPS brings to policymakers and communities.

As LEAPS turns 10, its message is part technical, part civic: Clean, resilient energy is possible when universities turn ideas into solutions.

The LEAPS portfolio — Hopi electrification, multi-island mini-grids, national energy planning, refugee clinics with solar power, women-led business support, technology transfer, technical consulting and military resilience programs — shows how a single lab can move ideas into durable projects by combining engineering, finance, policy and training.

If the next decade is defined by an intensifying energy demand curve, then institutions that can translate innovation into infrastructure and training at scale will define success.

“We want to formalize our approach to solutions and extension services and expand it beyond energy into other sectors of the economy,” Johnson says. “I think that’s emblematic of ASU’s spirit in the New American University.”

For communities from the Hopi lands to remote Pacific islands, LEAPS is delivering energy and economic development in 20 countries, with more to come in the years ahead.",https://news.asu.edu/sites/g/files/litvpz161/files/2025-12/SCAI_Leaps_20181025SolarPanels_12.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:00:58.356937

Frequently asked questions: Who is a qualified third-party?
Where do I find a qualified third-party to inspect my project or approve plans?
The Texas Solar Energy Society (TXSES) is the residential rooftop solar industry’s nonprofit statewide organization that can help identify qualified third-parties for installers.
The third-party is liable for damages resulting from their own negligent acts or omissions in conducting the review or inspection.","The adoption of solar energy in Texas is getting a major boost! Thanks to Senate Bill 1202, which passed in the 89th Texas legislative session and is now in effect, the time-consuming process of getting permits and inspections for residential solar and battery storage systems can now be streamlined. This new law gives both homeowners and solar installers a powerful new tool to bypass long delays from local authorities, making the path to clean, resilient home power much faster and more predictable.

This article breaks down how this new, optional permitting path works, what it covers, and the steps installers must follow.

What is SB 1202 and What Does It Cover?

SB 1202 creates an alternative path for the review and inspection of residential backup power systems—installations designed to provide power to a single- or two-family home and connected at 600 volts or less. This includes:

Rooftop Solar

Battery Energy Storage Systems

Generators

Other electricity generation or storage 600 volts or less

The bill allows installers to utilize qualified third-parties to perform the plan reviews and inspections that were historically done only by the local municipality, or the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). While cities are not required to speed up their own processes, installers can now choose this third-party option to accelerate their projects.

The Third-Party Permitting Process

Step 1: Choosing the Third-Party Path

The process begins with the installer deciding whether to use the AHJ (the city) or a qualified third-party for either the plan review, the project inspection, or both.If the installer chooses the AHJ, the process remains the same as before, with no mandated deadline for the city to complete the review or inspection.

If the installer chooses a qualified third party, the third party will then need the AHJ’s applicable code and regulations. The AHJ must publish their applicable code and regulations online or provide them upon request within 2 business days. If the AHJ does not publish or provide the code and regulations within this timeframe, the third party may use the applicable section of the International Residential Code.

Step 2: Review and Inspection by the Qualified Third-Party

Once the third-party has the necessary code information, they conduct the required plan review and/or inspection. While the third-party is not required to conduct the plan review or inspection within a certain timeframe, they will be paid for this service by the installer so they are expected to be timely. It is also important to note that virtual inspections and using automated rooftop solar permitting tools like SolarAPP+ are explicitly allowed in the legislation.

Step 3: Notification and Beginning Construction

Whenever the third party has completed the plan review and/or inspection, they must submit the documents and a notice to the AHJ within 15 days of it being completed.

Once the third party has notified the AHJ that this installation is utilizing a third party under SB1202 and provides the documentation of plan review and/or inspection, the installer may begin construction of the project. The AHJ may not require a fee for the plan review or inspection that was done by the third party.

Step 4: Final Permit Issuance

Within three business days of receiving the notice and documents from the qualified third-party, the AHJ must issue the appropriate final approval, permit, or certification for the project.

Frequently asked questions:

Who is a qualified third-party?

Third parties for permit review and/or inspection include:

Master electricians

Certified electrical inspectors

Individuals employed by a Texas AHJ to review development documents

Licensed engineers

The third party may not be the homeowner or installer.

Does this apply to permits or fees for interconnection with transmission and distribution utilities (TDUs), utility co-ops, or municipally owned utilities?

This law does not apply to interactions with transmission and distribution utilities, however many TDUs do require a permit from the AHJ, which is provided in the third-party process within 3 business days of the AHJ receiving notice from the third-party that the project has been approved.

Where do I find a qualified third-party to inspect my project or approve plans?

The Texas Solar Energy Society (TXSES) is the residential rooftop solar industry’s nonprofit statewide organization that can help identify qualified third-parties for installers.

Round 7 Awardees:

Village of Maybrook, Orange County – $25.48 million: This infrastructure improvement project will allow for the development of the Switchyard Terminal for Economic and Advanced Manufacturing (STEAM) Rail & Business Park at the long- vacant Maybrook Rail Yard. The grant will fund infrastructure installation, improvements and expansions set to benefit roads, water, sewer, and drainage infrastructure. The result will be six building-pad sites accessible via the existing Middletown, New Jersey, rail line. Strategically located just 75 miles from New York City, these infrastructure upgrades will present the Village with the opportunity to catalyze the regional economy by attracting strategic industries and achieve the goal of establishing an economic hub to become a key facet of the New York manufacturing ecosystem.

Fulton County Industrial Development Agency – $8.99 million: This infrastructure improvement project will allow for adaptive reuse and revitalization of Tryon Technology Park, a former NYS Juvenile Correctional Facility in Perth. Funding for this project will be used for upgrades to the water pump station and mains, upgrades to the wastewater pumps and force mains, demolition and earthwork. The project will prepare the 220-acre site for further development of up to four buildings ranging in size from 150,000 to 1.3 million square feet for manufacturing companies looking to locate in the area. Infrastructure upgrades included in this project will allow the Tryon Technology Park to tap into abundant water and wastewater capacities, making this site uniquely positioned to attract strategic agribusiness, food processing, and life science investment.

Herkimer County Industrial Development Agency – $7.9 million: This infrastructure improvement project will allow for key infrastructure upgrades needed at the Central New York Business Center to offer a shovel-ready industrial site for advanced manufacturing. Funds will be used to upgrade 2,000 feet of the Higby Road gas main, construction of an onsite water tank for fire protection, new turn lanes and traffic signals, plus demolition, grading, stormwater, and utility extensions. The site offers access to two million gallons per day in excess water capacity and 2.6 million gallons per day in excess wastewater capacity available in the district. Central New York Business Center is strategically located in the Town of Frankfort, near major highways and other industrial development and, once complete, it will deliver an industry-ready site that will attract advanced manufacturers, create jobs, and expand New York’s manufacturing economy.

Advance Albany County Alliance Local Development Corporation – $500,000: This pre-development project will allow for shovel-ready advancement of the Al Tech Advanced Manufacturing Campus. Funds will be used to recruit an engineering firm to develop a Master Engineering Plan, complete a SEQR and GEIS Survey, evaluate the site’s utility infrastructure (water, sewer, gas, stormwater, telecommunication), plan site prep for demolition of legacy structures, and work with National Grid on the development of substation design and engineering. The funding will provide future developers with valuable information and support a future Brownfield Cleanup Program (BCP) tax credit application. This scope of work represents an important step in the redevelopment of this site back into productive use. The project will expedite the site’s shovel-readiness and improve speed to market for future developers, ultimately supporting the creation of high-quality jobs for the Town of Colonie, and building the region’s industrial capacity.

Erie County – $500,000: This pre-development project will allow for shovel-ready advancement of engineering services associated with the implementation of sewer and wastewater capacity improvements through the Elma Pumping Station and force main upgrades project. Funding will be used for design and permitting work required to advance the engineering design of the project, thus preparing the corridor for implementation. These infrastructure improvements would more than double the wastewater capacity for the corridor and support the growth of industries with the creation of jobs in advanced manufacturing in the Town of Elma.

First announced in February 2022, FAST NY helps to diversify New York State’s economy while generating new investments for businesses, communities and job creation. Following an initial commitment of $200 million, Governor Hochul subsequently secured an additional $100 million for FAST NY in both the FY25 and FY26 State Budgets for a total of $400 million. FAST NY has attracted or expanded the presence in New York State for companies such as fairlife, Chobani, Edwards Vacuum, Siemens Mobility and Oxbo. These companies will invest over $2.2 billion and create nearly 3,000 jobs.

FAST NY grants are awarded for pre-development activities and infrastructure investments to develop sites that will attract many eligible industries, including high-tech manufacturing, semiconductors, clean-tech renewable energy, life sciences, agribusiness, optics, transportation equipment, materials processing, industrial machinery manufacturing and other advanced manufacturing. These sites can also be used for interstate distribution and logistics. For more information, or to apply for a FAST NY grant, visit esd.ny.gov/fast-ny.

State Senator Patricia Fahy said, “When manufacturing left the Capital Region and Upstate New York communities decades ago, it primarily hurt working people's ability to get a meaningful, good-paying job and get ahead. With the FAST NY program, we're investing in the future of the Capital Region's manufacturing industry and bringing it back with workforce development aimed at advanced manufacturing industries. Connecting our workforce and families to advanced manufacturing opportunities will change lives, create new career paths and opportunities, and ensure our communities aren't just ready for the economy of tomorrow but able to capitalize on it as well. Today's announcement of $500,000 brings us closer to that goal, and by investing in true shovel-ready sites at the Al Tech Advanced Manufacturing Campus here in Albany, we’re accelerating growth in advanced manufacturing, strengthening our regional competitiveness, and laying the groundwork for thousands of future jobs across our Capital Region. I want to thank Governor Hochul and Empire State Development for their commitment to building out the infrastructure that high-growth industries demand, and for ensuring the Capital Region is ready to seize the next generation of economic opportunity.”

Village of Maybrook Mayor Dennis Leahy said, “For many years, the Maybrook Rail Yard has symbolized both great promise and missed opportunity. Today, through Governor Hochul’s leadership and the FAST NY program, we take a transformative step forward. The State’s $25 million investment will redevelop this long-idle property into the Switchyard Terminal for Economic and Advanced Manufacturing, establishing shovel-ready sites that will attract innovative employers and expand economic opportunity for Maybrook and Orange County. With our infrastructure revitalized, the Village is prepared to assume its role as a regional economic center, and we extend our sincere appreciation for the State’s partnership in building a stronger, more prosperous future.”

Herkimer County Chairman Peter J. Campione said, ""We are grateful to Governor Hochul for this significant investment in the Central New York Business Center. This funding will allow us to complete essential infrastructure upgrades that prepare the site for advanced manufacturing, drive job creation, and strengthen the region’s economic future.

Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries.
Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.
An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program.","California’s last nuclear power plant overcame a regulatory hurdle on Thursday when the California Coastal Commission voted to approve keeping the plant open for at least five years.

It was one of the final obstacles the controversial Diablo Canyon Power Plant had to clear to continue operating amid renewed opposition. The decision was conditioned on a plan that would require Pacific Gas & Electric, which owns the plant, to conserve about 4,000 acres of land on its property. That would prevent it from ever being developed for commercial or residential use.

The plant, located along the San Luis Obispo shoreline, now awaits federal approval for a 20-year relicensing permit.

“I don’t think, unfortunately, that anything will be happening to Diablo Canyon soon,” due to the growing energy demands of artificial intelligence, Commissioner Jaime Lee said before voting to approve the permit. Nine of the 12 voting members approved the plan.

The deliberations reignited decades-old concerns about the dangers of nuclear power and its place in the state’s portfolio of renewable energy sources. Diablo Canyon is the state’s single-largest energy source, providing nearly 10% of all California electricity.

Defeated in their earlier attempts to shut the plant, critics of Diablo Canyon used months of Coastal Commission hearings as one of their last opportunities to vocalize their disdain for the facility. Some Democratic lawmakers supported the plant but pushed for PG&E to find more ways to protect the environment.

Sen. John Laird, Democrat of San Luis Obispo County and former secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, said on Thursday he approved of the new plan but pushed the commission to require the utility to conserve even more of its total 12,000 surrounding acres.

“If what comes out of this is the path for preservation for 8,000 acres of land, that is a remarkable victory,” Laird said.

Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis, whose district encompasses the plant, had also urged the commission in a letter to approve a permit “once it contains strong mitigation measures that reflect the values and needs of the surrounding tribal and local communities who depend on our coastal regions for environmental health, biodiversity and economic vitality.”

A long history of controversy

Founded in 1985, the plant’s striking concrete domes sit along the Pacific coast 200 miles north of Los Angeles. The facility draws in 2 million gallons of water from the ocean every day to cool its systems

And it has remained shrouded in controversy since its construction 40 years ago. Environmentalists point to the damage it causes to marine life, killing what the Coastal Commission estimates are 2 billion larval fish a year.

The commissioners on Thursday were not deciding whether to allow the plant to stay open but were weighing how best to lessen the environmental impacts of its operation. A 2022 state law forced the plant to stay open for five more years past its planned 2025 closure date, which could have led to significant political blowback against the Coastal Commission if it had rejected the permit.

Gov. Gavin Newsom reversed a 2016 agreement made between environmental groups and worker unions to close the plant after the state faced a series of climate disasters that spurred energy blackouts. Popular sentiment toward nuclear energy has also continued to grow more supportive as states across the country consider revitalizing dormant and aging nuclear plants to fulfill ever-increasing energy demand needs.

The 2022 law authorized a $1.4 billion loan to be paid back with federal loans or profits.

Groups such as the Environmental Defense Center and Mothers for Peace opposed the permit outright, citing concerns about radioactive waste, which can persist for centuries, and its cost to taxpayers.

“We maintain that any extension of Diablo is unnecessary,” and that its continued operations could slow the development of solar and wind energy, Jeremy Frankel, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Center told the commission Thursday.

The California Public Utilities Commission last year approved $723 million in ratepayer funds toward Diablo Canyon’s operating costs this year. It was the first time rate hikes were spread to ratepayers of other utilities such as Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric and was authorized by lawmakers because the plant provides energy to the entire state.

How the plant will be funded has also garnered scrutiny in the years since Newsom worked to keep it open. Last year, the Legislature nearly canceled a $400 million loan to help finance it.

As much as $588 million is unlikely to come back due to insufficient federal funding and projected profits, CalMatters has reported.

Proponents of the plant pointed to its reliability, carbon-free pollution and the thousands of jobs it has created.

Business advocacy groups emphasized their support for the plant as boosting the economy.

“It is an economic lifeline that helps keep our communities strong and competitive,” Dora Westerlund, president of the Fresno Area Hispanic Foundation, said at a November meeting.

The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation’s most marginalized populations.

Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.

The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.

Scientists said the change will affect all cancer registries, in every state and territory, because they receive federal funding. Starting in 2026, registries funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute will categorize cancer patients as male, female, or not stated/unknown. And federal health agencies will receive data only on cancer patients classified that way.

Registries currently specify whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.

President Donald Trump in January issued an executive order stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.

“In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.

Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.

Missing the Big Picture

Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.

“When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.

“The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”

For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.

Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents 97% of the U.S. population. The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering nearly half the U.S. population.

The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.

For example, data collected by cancer registries was essential in identifying rising rates of colorectal cancer among people younger than 50. As a result, U.S. guidelines now recommend that adults start screenings at age 45 rather than 50.

States have enacted their own measures. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said epidemiologists with the Texas Cancer Registry in 2018 found that the state had the nation’s highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer more common in men than women. The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas initiated a statewide effort aimed at reversing rising rates of liver cancer. The Texas Cancer Registry joined SEER in 2021.

“Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”

The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.

For any given patient, under NAACCR’s standards, Durbin said, registries collect more than 700 pieces of information, including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and length of survival. CDC and NCI-funded registries must specify the sex of each patient.

The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.

In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”

‘Backwards’ Progress

NAACCR routinely publishes updated guidelines. But the change to the “sex” category to remove transgender options in 2026 was an emergency move due to Trump administration policies, Kozlovich said. She was among a group that had pushed for changes in cancer data collection to account for sex and gender identity as separate data points.

According to an analysis of CDC data by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 2.8 million people age 13 and older identify as transgender.

Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.

“Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.

A study published in 2022 found that transgender and gender-diverse populations were two to three times as likely as cisgender people to report active use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.

A Canadian study concluded in 2019 that transgender patients were less likely to receive recommended screenings for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. And a 2023 study from researchers at Stanford Medicine found that LGBTQ+ patients were nearly three times as likely to experience breast cancer recurrence as cisgender heterosexual people.

Scarlett Lin Gomez, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco and the director of the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, said that for at least 10 years the NCI had been interested in improving its ability to monitor cancer burden across patient populations with different sexual orientations and gender identities. Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.

There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”

The decision not to capture transgender identity in cancer patients is just one change registries have confronted under the Trump administration, according to scientists leading surveillance efforts and state health agencies. An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program. Scientists said CDC funds for registries haven’t been cut; however, the White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget aims to eliminate funding for the National Program of Cancer Registries.

Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and stopping specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.

Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”

There is a new cost to hiring an international worker to fill a vital but otherwise vacant position in a California classroom: $100,000.

In September, the Trump administration began requiring American employers to pay a $100,000 sponsorship fee for new H-1B visas, on top of already required visa application fees that amount to $9,500 to $18,800, depending on various factors. These visas allow skilled and credentialed workers in multiple job sectors to stay in the U.S.

Most foreign workers on H-1Bs in California work in the tech sector. But California also relies on H-1B visas to address another issue: a nationwide teacher shortage and a high demand for staff in dual-language education and special education in K-12 districts.

Data from the California Department of Education shows school districts filed more than 300 visa applications for the 2023-24 school year, double the amount from just two years earlier. Educators and school officials say its overseas workers on visas are highly skilled, instrumental in multilingual education, and fill historically understaffed positions in special education.

Now education leaders are sounding the alarm that the high additional fee for overseas workers will worsen the strain on California’s public education system.

International employees fill a much-needed gap for school districts

California continues to face an ongoing teacher shortage. In 2023, California K-12 schools staffed 46,982 positions with employees whose credentials did not align with their job assignments, according to data from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Another 22,012 educator positions were left vacant that year. Of total misassignments and vacancies, around 28% were in English language development and 11.9% were in special education.

California school districts have also resorted to hiring teachers who haven’t yet obtained certain credentials, according to a study by the nonprofit Learning Policy Institute. Facing a need for teachers, school districts have found that trained professionals from other countries are willing — and qualified — to take classroom jobs that would otherwise go unfilled.

In 2023, in the Bay Area east of San Francisco, West Contra Costa Unified School District had 381 misassigned positions and 711 vacancies, according to the commission. So the district turned to foreign educators, hiring about 88 teachers on H-1B visas — a majority from the Philippines, Spain and Mexico — to teach in mostly dual-language and special education programs, said Sylvia Greenwood, the assistant superintendent for human resources at the district.

“With our shortages in special ed, they were a good fit for our district. And so, therefore, we kept that pipeline open and brought teachers here from the Philippines to support our students and our students with special needs,” Greenwood said.

The decline in the number of credentialed special education teachers continues to worsen. Between 2020 and 2024, the number of credentials earned to teach special education decreased by almost 600 across California, according to data from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. The number of temporary permits and waivers granted by the commission increased by about 300 during the same period.

Francisco Ortiz, the president of United Teachers of Richmond and a teacher at Ford Elementary School in West Contra Costa, said the workload for teachers in the district will increase if West Contra Costa Unified is unable to bring in new international teachers.

This would create “greater instability” for students, he said, adding, “It's going to have a great impact in special education, which is already on fire.”

California school district officials say they are unsure they can pay the new fee to fill hiring gaps with international employees. West Contra Costa officials said they do not know yet who will be responsible for paying the new fee: the district, international teachers themselves or another party.

“We are a district that is dealing with a structural deficit as well, and so that cost, in a lot of ways, is going to be very difficult for our district or really any school district, to be able to take that on,” said Cheryl Cotton, the superintendent for West Contra Costa.

It’s essentially a giant ‘Keep Out’ sign.

— Laura Flores-Perilla, an attorney with L.A.-based Justice Action Center

Pasadena Unified, in Southern California, filed about a dozen applications for H-1B visa sponsorships in 2024. Now the district, facing a $27 million budget deficit, will require those applying for H-1B visas to pay for it themselves, according to district spokesperson Hilda Ramirez Horvath. She said foreign employees will also no longer receive other types of financial support, including legal or filing fees related to immigration processing.

Language programs benefit from international teachers

District officials are also worried about the cultural costs of losing international educators. Educators on H-1B visas make dual-language public schools possible, giving families in California a unique multicultural education that sticks with their children for life.

Kelleen Peckham, a mother to two children in West Contra Costa, said she chose to transfer her daughter to Washington Elementary School in Richmond because it has a dual-language immersion program that teaches students to speak and read Spanish.

Peckham also plans to send her son, who will start kindergarten next year, to the same school even though it takes the family an extra 15 minutes to drive there.

“My husband's family is from Mexico, and so [their] grandmother, on one side, only speaks Spanish,” Peckham said. “It's important for [them] to be able to communicate with [their] family and extended family.”

She said if the dual-language immersion program at Washington Elementary doesn’t survive, she would consider transferring her children back to the school in their neighborhood.

Fee spells ‘Keep Out’ to foreign workers

Within weeks of the fee’s announcement, a coalition of international worker groups, unions and religious organizations sued the Trump administration, alleging the fee would inhibit staffing in education, medicine and ministry services.

“It’s essentially a giant ‘Keep Out’ sign for prospective individuals looking to utilize the visa process to be able to come to the United States and fill these roles and provide these services,” said Laura Flores-Perilla, an attorney with the Justice Action Center, a Los Angeles-based immigration litigation group representing the coalition in its lawsuit.

“It's not just going to hurt these individuals who have this pathway to do this, but it's also going to hurt employers within the United States,” Flores-Perilla said.

Although the fee only applies to new visa applicants, many international teachers are feeling less welcomed to work and live in the states. A.F., an international elementary school teacher in the West Contra Costa Unified School District, said many teachers are still concerned the federal government will announce new policy changes that could force them to leave the U.S.

“I feel like it's a form of discrimination to impose [a] $100,000 fee for teachers,” A.F. said.

A.F., who is currently on an H-1B visa, asked to only give his initials because he fears speaking publicly will affect his ability to receive a green card in the future. He immigrated from the Philippines to California five years ago on a J-1 visa before transferring to an H-1B visa at the beginning of 2025. J-1 visas allow visitors to temporarily stay in the U.S. to participate in certain programs, including teaching, studying, conducting research and more, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

A.F. said the district previously paid for all of his immigration costs for his H-1B visa, which amounted to more than $3,700 for processing fees and an immigration attorney.

The future is uncertain for H-1B visa hopefuls

H.R., a physical education teacher in West Contra Costa who works on a short-term J-1 visa, said he moved his family from Mexico to the U.S. three years ago to work at one of the district’s high schools because he felt it would be safer to raise his daughter in the U.S. H.R. requested to use only his initials because he doesn’t want to jeopardize his ability to apply for the H-1B visa in the future.

“My biggest reason [for moving] is my daughter,” he said. “Me and my wife decided that it would be a good chance for her [and] a big opportunity to learn the language and to grow up in a different environment.”

H.R. can’t apply for the H-1B visa because he missed the deadline and West Contra Costa Unified is now unlikely to pay for his immigration fees. After his visa expires in June 2026, H.R. will move back to Mexico with his family and reapply for the J-1 visa in hopes of returning to California.

“Everybody says here that they need teachers in California … but they don't want to do anything to [help us stay] here,” H.R. said.

At the Los Angeles Unified School District, spokesperson Christy Hagen said in an email to CalMatters that the recent visa changes have not yet impacted the school’s hiring of educators on H-1B visas. Hagen said the district’s immigration experts were “still evaluating the effect of this order.”

Maria Miranda, a representative for United Teachers Los Angeles — the union for Los Angeles Unified teachers — said the district had, as of mid-November, not provided any guidance to its educators or schools on how H-1B visa hopefuls would be supported.

Flores-Perilla, the attorney bringing the lawsuit against the Trump administration, says no hearings have been set in their case yet. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has now also brought a lawsuit over the $100,000 fee, arguing that the proclamation overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and harms U.S. employers.

For now, districts will have to wait on the results of either lawsuit to potentially see some relief in immigration costs.

“It's absolutely unfeasible to be able to pay this fee [and] to be able to actually bring in prospective employees in their fields and industries, so it's going to hurt everyone,” Flores-Perilla said.

The Trump administration is proposing new rules that would further tighten its grip on who's allowed into the U.S., asking visitors from several dozen countries that benefit from visa-free travel to hand over their social media history and other personal information.

The new conditions were unveiled in a notice from the Department of Homeland Security earlier this week and are open for public comment and review for 60 days before going into effect.

The proposed measure applies to citizens from the 42 countries that belong to the visa waiver program and currently don't require visas for tourist or business visits to the U.S. Those foreign citizens would now have to submit five years' worth of their social media activity to be considered for entry.

They'd also have to provide emails they have used for the past 10 years, as well as phone numbers and home addresses of immediate family members. Officials would also be able to scrutinize IP addresses and metadata from electronically submitted photos.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the mandatory social media requirement is designed to comply with President Donald Trump's January executive order ""to protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes."" However, they have not defined what type of online activity may constitute a threat.

Under the current visa waiver program, tourists can bypass the visa application process, which can take months to years. Instead, they pay $40 and submit an online application using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA. It's accessible to citizens of U.S. allied countries, including Australia, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. But that system may also get an overhaul if the latest changes take effect. The notice proposes eliminating online applications, moving to a mobile-only platform.

This is the latest step in the Trump administration's escalation of restrictions and surveillance of international travelers, foreign students and immigrants. In June, the State Department announced it will begin reviewing the social media accounts of foreign students. Earlier this month, the department instructed its staff to reject visa applications — primarily H-1B — from people who worked on fact-checking, content moderation or other activities, citing it as ""censorship"" of Americans' speech.

These latest proposed changes are not that different from those already in place for visa applicants, Marissa Montes, a professor at Loyola Law School, and director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic, told NPR.

""It's always been something that the government can ask for and has asked for in the past,"" Montes said. ""The question is, how will [ESTA applicants] be screened by CPB? Will it be something they have to submit ahead of time or will it be an officer at a point of entry? We still don't know how the administration expects to implement this.""

In the past, she said, such screenings occurred at the point of entry and that ""it's always been discretionary if the officer wants to ask for it or not.""

What is most troubling, Montes added, is that there are no explicit guidelines defining what qualifies as harmful to the United States.

""The problem is that when it comes to immigration policy and directives like this is that it's very broad and discretionary, meaning that the agent that is receiving this order has a lot of discretion to then interpret what can be viewed as anti-American,"" she said. ""But we have seen that be interpreted as anything that goes against the Trump administration or is going against a value of the Trump administration.""

Montes said she advises her clients to be mindful of not just their own online posts, but also posts they've liked, commented on and re-posted, which can be grounds for a denial or even a permanent ban from the U.S. For example, if someone has posts regarding casual drug use, or pictures of firearms, they can be viewed as a potential threat to the government. She said agents are also on the look out for posts that can be construed as pro-socialist or communist.

She cautions people not to eliminate their social media presence entirely, saying it's ""become a red flag"" for officials.

""Our immigration laws bar certain types of conduct because of immigration bias … so you really have to be careful about what you put out there,"" she warned. ""As I always tell my clients, if I can find the information, the government certainly can.""

Chop suey was once a classic Chinese American dish enjoyed on December 25 — a day when most other restaurants were closed — by Jews and other non-Christians.

These days, we tend to think of chop suey as a mishmash of stir-fried ingredients that emerged from immigrant communities in the United States. But its roots run deep, says Miranda Brown, a professor of Chinese history at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She wrote a 2021 article called ""The Hidden, Magnificent History of Chop Suey"" for the website Atlas Obscura.

""It's a dish that is chopped offal,"" she says. ""Lung, liver, tripe, kidneys.""

Yes, originally chop suey was primarily made of organ meats. Brown is quick to note that offal is flavorful, rich in nutrients, and was enjoyed widely until a few generations ago, thanks, in part to industrial meat packaging processes.

""It can be chewy, it can be buttery, it can be kind of rubbery,"" Brown says of offal's distinctive textures. ""For some people, that's really kind of exciting. Bouncy!""

The origins of the dish itself bounces back hundreds of years, she says, to imperial China.

""We have references to chop suey in Ming Dynasty texts,"" she notes. ""The Journey to the West, which is a famous novel [from the 16th century], has a reference to chop suey. You will find it on fancy banquet menus. A version of the dish was even eaten at the Qing court.""

When Chinese immigrants to the U.S. in the mid-1800s wanted to impress local officials, Brown says, they held banquets similar to ones back home, with 300-course meals that would get written up in local newspapers, in articles marveling over delicacies such as Peking duck, chop suey and bird's nest soup.

""All the bling foods that were popular when you had to [build] a good relationship with a person who had a lot of say about your life,"" Brown says.

The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 restricted immigration heavily, but Chinese restaurants still spread rapidly across the United States. By the early 1900s, chop suey had become a cultural phenomenon, a beloved ambassador dish to what had been an unfamiliar cuisine to many Americans.

Louis Armstrong recorded a song in 1926 called ""Cornet Chop Suey."" The 1958 musical Flower Drum Song dedicated an entire number to it. And in the movie A Christmas Story, set in the 1940s and based on the writings of Jean Shepherd, a white, Midwestern, working-class family celebrates Christmas at a Chinese restaurant called the Bo Ling Chop Suey Palace.

""It was exotic,"" Brown says. ""It involves a little bit of adventure, and it is a name that people can pronounce.""

But by the late 20th century, chop suey had fallen out of fashion. Brown says she never saw it on menus in her home city of San Francisco in the 1980s, when she was growing up. By then, Americans had deepened their appreciation of Chinese food, thanks in large part to popular cookbook author, PBS host and restaurateur Cecilia Chiang.

Before she died in 2020 at the age of 100, Chiang told NPR she thought it was hilarious how so many Americans had believed that the contemporary versions of chop suey were authentic. ""They think, oh, chop suey is the only thing we have in China,"" she said in a 2017 NPR interview. ""What a shame!""

""I think for her, it had just evolved to the point where it was no longer recognizable,"" says Miranda Brown, whose own mixed heritage is half white, half Chinese. ""Foods evolve. I always think, if I met my great-great-grandparents, would they recognize me? Would they see elements of their faces in mine or my daughter's? And I would guess not. Something similar happened with Chinese food in America. When a dish leaves, a hundred years later it has evolved, a lot.""

And perhaps it's about time, Brown says, for chop suey's next evolution: to make a comeback.

You can see it in the skyline, the neighborhoods and the factories reborn as tech hubs. But under that grit lies unseen problems — polluted air, contaminated water, aging infrastructure and a city still dealing with the long-term effects of its industrial history.

Wayne State University's Grand Challenges initiative directly confronts these problems, serving as a call to action for researchers committed to making actual progress.

“We wanted themes that matter to Detroiters,” said Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation. “These challenges had to be connected to what communities tell us they’re living with every day — air quality, water, health and the environment.”

Among the four themes in the initiative, one stands out in a city defined by the Great Lakes, auto exhaust and environmental justice: How do we build sustainable environments that improve both quality of life and length of life?

Across Midtown, Wayne State researchers are seeking answers grounded in Detroit’s realities.

If there’s one message Dr. Carol Miller keeps coming back to, it’s this: water connects everything.

Miller, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the James and Patricia Anderson College of Engineering, is a long-time leader in Great Lakes research. Her work shows how chemicals from everyday products — medicines, cleaners, cosmetics — move through wastewater systems before winding up in rivers and lakes. But when asked about the most important step toward a sustainable environment, she didn’t start with labs or technology. She started with people.

“To improve quality of life in Detroit,” she said, “the most immediate impact comes from raising people out of poverty and supporting the needs of their communities.”

When Dr. Miller focuses strictly on environmental factors, she points to issues that have haunted the Motor City for decades. “I would say the removal or mitigation of legacy environmental pollutants,” she said. “These cause a long-term impact on health and quality of life.”

That includes cleaning up chemicals left behind by old gas stations, dry cleaners and factories.

Air pollution is another priority.

“Transportation exhaust continues to be a huge concern in pockets of the city,” she said. “I’m confident that if that air pollution could be reduced, the length of life and the quality of life of people in those areas would be improved.”

Her research also includes identifying and tracking contaminants below our feet — in the soil, groundwater and the myriad of water infrastructure piping under Southeast Michigan. Dr. Miller’s group studies sustainable remediation that includes approaches to harvest energy from polluting sources. But her message never strays far: science only matters if it improves lives.

“One of the critical steps is greater use of the One Health approach,” she said. “We need to break down the silos between human health, animal health, environmental health and economic health.”

Dr. Kishore Gopalakrishnan, a research scientist in the Department of Biological Sciences in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, sees wastewater differently than most people.

Where many see something that’s thrown away, he sees nutrients, carbon and possibilities. “Our aim is to grow microalgae in wastewater so we can remove the nitrogen and phosphorus before it reaches rivers or lakes,” he explained. Those nutrients are exactly what fuel harmful algal blooms.

Then the algae become a resource.

“We can harvest these algae, and it’s rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids,” he said. “It can be used as a feed in aquaculture instead of relying on fish oil from wild-caught fish.”

His guiding principle is simple: “We need to rethink waste as part of a circular system. What leaves one process should be the input of another.”

Dr. Gopalakrishnan’s work also tackles microplastics and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS, and how contaminants move through the food chain. He believes the most promising solutions are the ones that follow nature’s lead.

“The most promising solution would be nature-based and circular. Systems that work with biology instead of against it.”",https://news.wayne.edu/storage/files/gc1-69371b2149558.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:01:21.256431
,North Carolina Environment,2025-12-12 19:23:37+00:00,BPR,"For Helene survivors, a stalled federal buyout program could spell financial trouble","Laura Hackett, www.bpr.org, laura-hackett",,,,,https://www.bpr.org/helene-recovery/2025-12-12/for-helene-survivors-a-stalled-federal-buyout-program-could-spell-financial-trouble,"“And the land's completely gone now.” Scenarios like these are why FEMA started the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.
Over the last few months, state officials have raised concerns about FEMA’s response time and its commitment to moving the program forward.
The North Carolina Emergency Management department has also been awarded roughly $19 million to manage and implement the Hazard Mitigation Program, but nothing can move forward without the agency’s final approval.
The agency also said it would be “factually incorrect” to report that the program has stalled.
“What I have seen and what I've heard from my colleagues is there seems to be a general hesitation, a slow down, related to hazard mitigation nationally,” Ray said.","Mary Lynn Manns’ two-bedroom home sits on a tranquil patch of land near the Swannanoa River.

When she moved in a decade ago, she expected to live the rest of her life in the house. Then, Hurricane Helene caused the river to swell nearly 30 feet high, flooding the foundation. Since then, Manns, along with many of her peers in East Asheville’s River Knolls neighborhood, have been unable to return to their homes.

“The foundations are in bad shape,” Manns said. “You can't just put up a house. And plus, we've had the discussion, should we do this? We're clearly now in a floodplain. Would it be right to rebuild that house? The idea of rebuilding in an area that's clearly a problem just doesn't seem like the proper ethical thing to do.”

When she purchased the home a decade ago, the location was not designated as a high-risk flood zone by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and her mortgage did not require flood insurance, she said. Now, the river bank has widened, encroaching further into the neighborhood.

One house just down the road from Manns now sits right on the edge of the bank. The floodwaters swept away the land, leaving a precipitous slope in place of the backyard.

“People had little gardens back here. There was land,” Manns said. “And the land's completely gone now.”

Scenarios like these are why FEMA started the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. The agency doesn’t want people to rebuild homes in a floodplain, where they're likely to flood again, so it offers homeowners the option to sell their property at pre-storm values, rebuild the home on stilts or relocate it.

But Manns, who applied for the program last November, is growing increasingly concerned about when – or even if – she’ll receive money for her property. Over the last few months, state officials have raised concerns about FEMA’s response time and its commitment to moving the program forward. The agency has not approved any buyouts yet, though the first batch of applications was submitted nearly 10 months ago. More than 500 applications, totaling more than $240 million in property value, sit stagnant, awaiting a sign-off from FEMA, according to multiple officials from the state’s emergency management office.

“We're trying to be as communicative as we can to homeowners who may be waiting,” Matt Calabria, the director of Grown NC, said at a November meeting. “The reality is we've submitted the information for so many of those folks and we don't have a whole lot of information to share other than to affirm, yes, we have submitted them.”

FEMA has awarded some of the $1.5 billion dollars it set aside as part of the Hazard Mitigation Program, but none of the money has gone towards home buyouts. The agency has awarded $466,000 to Clyde and $600,000 to Greenville. The money will support the engineering and planning costs for flood mitigation in both communities. The North Carolina Emergency Management department has also been awarded roughly $19 million to manage and implement the Hazard Mitigation Program, but nothing can move forward without the agency’s final approval.

State presses FEMA to move forward

This month, Governor Josh Stein wrote a letter to the new FEMA Administrator Karen Evans, urging the agency to “be responsive to the needs of North Carolinians.”

Stein’s letter also criticized the agency’s delays with its Public Assistance program, which provides reimbursements to local governments for Helene recovery projects like debris removal and road repair.

“Further delay of these approvals keeps communities and families in limbo, in some cases paying expenses on homes they cannot live in while they await word from FEMA,” Stein wrote, of the buyout delays. “Your efforts to begin and accelerate the program would greatly benefit the people of western North Carolina.”

FEMA declined an interview request with BPR, but wrote in an email that the majority of the applications “are currently ineligible” because they don’t meet certain program requirements. The agency also said it would be “factually incorrect” to report that the program has stalled.

William Ray, the Director of the North Carolina Department of Emergency Management, disputed some of FEMA’s claims in an interview with BPR.

“We do not have anything in hand that says that officially things are ineligible,” he said, adding that FEMA’s operations are moving slower than normal.

“What I have seen and what I've heard from my colleagues is there seems to be a general hesitation, a slow down, related to hazard mitigation nationally,” Ray said. He pointed to FEMA’s recent decision not to approve hazard mitigation funding in North Carolina’s Triangle after Tropical Storm Chantal damaged more than 200 homes and apartments as an example.

In the case of Helene funding, FEMA contends the majority of applications for buyouts are not meeting the “open space” requirement, which mandates that any property obtained through the Hazard Mitigation program remains as an open green space in perpetuity, with a “clear title, no deed restrictions, and assurances the property will stay undeveloped.”

On some applications, the state has asked for an exemption on this “open space” requirement. That’s because in the places where Helene caused roads to crumble away, the only way to rebuild the road is through additional land use, Ray said.

“That, fundamentally, is one of the challenges we're navigating right now. DOT may need a portion of a parcel of property for repair or reconstruction of a roadway that was existing due to a river change or landscape change,” Ray said. “There are areas where there's not a whole lot of options of where to put the roadway.”

Ray added that typically the state doesn’t face significant delays when trying to move projects forward.

“In past events, we have had much different interaction with our regional office and their ability to make decisions and kind of move things forward. So this has been a different experience,” he said.

Justin Graney, a spokesperson for the state's Emergency Management department, maintained that many of the pending applications are not asking for an “open space” exemption.

“Many of the applications pending approval either do not include properties caught between two Federal policies or a portion of properties that can be approved. The State continues to advocate for quick approval of these vital projects,” Graney wrote.

Meanwhile, rent and mortgage bills stack up

As this back and forth between the state government and FEMA continues, more than 500 damaged properties in Western North Carolina remain in limbo.

Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said he’s never seen anything like this.

“It is unfathomable to me that we're at the place where the federal government is dragging its feet so much and that we don't have any answers,” he said.

He’s worried about the impact this will have on disaster survivors.

“I fear for the homeowner that [are] waiting on these grants,” he said. “At some point, are they going to have to declare bankruptcy because they waited on the federal government?”

Mary Lynn Manns is worried, too. Right now, she’s on the hook for three monthly payments – a $900 mortgage, a $500 HOA fee and a $1,500 dollar monthly rent on an apartment.

“We're watching our savings just dwindle and dwindle and dwindle and we're going, ""Oh my God, how much longer can we do this?” she said.

The only reprieve in sight is coming from her HOA. Right now the association is in discussions about reducing the monthly by $300 a month",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/006bf74/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2Fe1%2Fd78d9b2c44b1b3060e58553b0d8f%2Fimg-4482.JPG,N,,2025-12-12 16:01:35.412510

This story was originally published by Canary Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

David Stevenson stood in a circle of friends and colleagues in an Orlando, Florida, hotel lobby. Everyone but him wore a lapel pin that read ​“I ♥ Fossil Fuels.”

“You want one?” asked a conference attendee, offering me the pin with a smirk. ​“It can be a souvenir.”

Stevenson, with a soft wave, gestured to the man to leave me alone. I was the only credentialed member of a legacy news organization attending this gathering, covering it for South Carolina’s largest newspaper, The Post and Courier, where I worked at the time. One organizer of the meeting, the Heartland Institute’s 2023 International Conference on Climate Change, blamed the media’s ​“constant lies” for the ban on some members of the press.

But Stevenson, then a policy director for the conservative think tank the Caesar Rodney Institute, had personally advocated for me to cover the event. He favored transparency and had no problem talking to me for hours about his primary political cause: making sure no offshore wind farms were ever built in US waters.

The conference drew luminaries from the world of climate skepticism, from Alex Epstein, author of ​The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, to Judith Curry and Ross McKitrick, a cherry-picking duo of marginal researchers more recently known for authoring a controversial 141-page government report downplaying the effects of human-caused climate change for the Trump administration. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) gave a keynote speech, mocking Democrats’ climate concerns. She held court next to the hotel pool that night, smoking a cigar with leaders from major conservative think tanks underneath palm fronds swaying in the breeze.

Stevenson saw himself as an outlier there. He leaned over during one session to tell me, cheekily, that he might be the ​“only person here who believes in climate change.”

And yet, despite that belief, Stevenson has dedicated the better part of a decade to obstructing a source of clean energy that can help replace the fossil fuels that are baking the planet. In fact, that’s why he was at the Heartland Institute’s conference: to rail against offshore wind farms.

The following day, Stevenson laid out his case in an expansive and mostly empty ballroom. It’s too expensive, he argued from a lectern, and the United States was not effectively assessing its environmental impact. He suggested a plan to get the public to care about this issue: putting whales front and center.

Stevenson stopped short of blaming wind companies for the spate of whale carcasses that had washed up on New Jersey and New York beaches just weeks prior. He agreed with the scientific evidence that ​“vessel strikes”—not wind development—were the biggest threat in that region. Still, the potential for harm to whales could be a powerful tool in federal court, he speculated, as well as in the court of public opinion.

At the time, Biden officials were approving new offshore wind projects at ​“breakneck speed.” Republican opposition was somewhat scant; GOP lawmakers in deep-red South Carolina had just put forth a pro–offshore wind bill. However, nuclear power—the energy sector Stevenson wanted to see advance—appeared to be on the downswing, with many US facilities having recently shuttered.

We parted ways after two days together at the conference, and I ultimately decided not to write a story about Stevenson. He seemed like little more than a gadfly to an increasingly powerful, multibillion-dollar offshore wind industry. I didn’t think much of it when he told me at the time that the industry would ​“crumble” before it even reached South Carolina.

I should have believed him; Stevenson was right.

The once high-flying offshore wind industry has been brought to its knees this year by President Donald Trump. In just the past few months, the Trump administration halted a nearly finished wind farm, clawed back $679 million in offshore wind grants, and moved to cancel permits for three other massive wind farms. Multiple fully permitted projects have been shelved. New development in the US seems impossible.

The stakes are high, particularly for the Northeast, where offshore wind was meant to not only slash emissions but also lower power bills, shore up grid reliability, and revitalize down-on-their-luck port towns with well-paying jobs. Strangling the sector for four years will be a devastating blow to these hopes.

Trump himself has a deep disdain for offshore wind, sparked by his failure to block a project from being built within view of his Scotland golf course a decade ago. But there is perhaps no other single person more responsible for watering the seeds of offshore wind opposition than Stevenson.

A January 2025 study by a Brown University research group placed Stevenson at the center of the network of activists and political operators driving America’s anti–offshore wind movement. The data showed he had an outsize influence in galvanizing lawsuits and public protests against wind farms. The analysis also tied Stevenson to a larger web of ​“dark money” networks that are financially backed by the fossil-fuel industry.

“The Brown study actually was fairly accurate about writing down all the people involved.…I was probably the common denominator for those groups,” Stevenson told me earlier this year.

Stevenson doesn’t fit into the neat box of being a climate denier. He doesn’t think we should continue burning fossil fuels forever. Instead, he’s someone who seeks to block certain solutions that address climate change, for reasons of his own—namely, ​“affordable and reliable” energy sources like nuclear and solar are better options, in his view. But scholars I spoke to about this discordance weren’t surprised at all.

“Outright climate denying seems to be decreasing,” said Alaina Kinol, a PhD candidate at Northeastern University who studies resistance to climate policy. ​“What we’re seeing more is obstruction,” she added, “and tactics that delay action.”

Stevenson, now 75, describes himself as ​“a lifelong conservationist.”

In the driveway of his Lewes, Delaware, home sits the hybrid vehicle he often drives to a nearby beach. Solar panels glint atop the roof, which Stevenson custom-designed in 2013 to be at the ​“optimum angle” to soak up the sun. A framed newspaper article about one of his cross-country bike rides hangs on the wall of his home office, nestled alongside photos of his seven children and 19 grandchildren.

His career has intersected with clean energy—and even wind—at various points.

While working for DuPont in the 1980s, Stevenson helped the chemical giant develop the long-lasting coatings used to make first-generation solar panels and wind turbine blades. In 1999, after leaving the company, he started his own construction business and acquired certifications in energy efficiency and home weatherization. He said he eventually co-founded the Delaware Green Building Council to promote this kind of work.

But despite Stevenson’s environmentally minded career and interests, he’s built a reputation as someone dedicated to preventing, rather than enabling, renewable energy.

After selling his construction business to one of his sons, Stevenson became interested in shaping state policies. A self-described libertarian, he found a home around 2010 at the Caesar Rodney Institute, a Delaware affiliate of the State Policy Network, which the Brown University researchers call ​“the nation’s most prominent network of conservative state-level think tanks.”

According to the DC-based research firm Energy Policy Institute, CRI is among a half dozen ​“front groups” backed by fossil-fuel interests that regularly attack renewable energy in their local regions.

For a few years, Stevenson worked on a variety of issues at CRI, from data centers and solid-state fuel cells to pipeline infrastructure and Delaware’s carbon-emissions fee. His initial brush with offshore wind came in 2010, when he sent a measured letter to the Obama administration regarding Bluewater Wind, the first proposed wind farm off the coast of Delaware. He voiced opposition to wind tax credits but acknowledged ​“one of the benefits of windmills” is how quickly they can be built.

It wasn’t until 2017 that he focused deeply on offshore wind, and by then his stance on the energy source was more firmly negative.

Plans for Skipjack Wind Farm—a 966-megawatt Danish-led project slated for waters off Maryland’s coastline with onshore stations in Delaware—were advancing quickly. They took Stevenson by surprise. ​“My initial response was just the high cost,” he recalled, though he also worried about the turbines ruining the ​“pristine view.”

The project was led by Ørsted, the world’s largest developer of offshore wind, which had bought the lease from the developers of Bluewater Wind. Stevenson said he tried to enlist help to fight the company, turning to Washington connections he’d forged during his time serving on Trump’s first transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency.

“I knew a lot of people; we had a lot of conversations,” Stevenson recalled. ​“They told me that I was nuts for taking on offshore wind.”

At the time, Trump officials were actively backing the sector. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke described himself as ​“very bullish on offshore wind” and executed key lease auctions put forth by the Obama administration—first near North Carolina, then near Massachusetts. Anti-wind policies wouldn’t emerge until the latter half of Trump 1.0, when Zinke’s successor, David Bernhardt, began slow-walking federal permits for offshore projects.

Stevenson received little response from his Washington connections. Undeterred, he simply led an anti-wind campaign on his own.

He attended town hall meetings and submitted public comments. He and fellow residents of local coastal communities organized against the wind project under the name Save Our Beach View, mailing over 35,000 letters and posting constantly to Facebook.

The messages contained several misleading statements. Independent journalist Michael Thomas reported that the letters, for example, ​“falsely claimed that the project could cause coastal residents’ property values to drop by between 20% and 30%; power costs could rise by 400%; key industries like tourism could see their revenues fall by 50%.”

Nevertheless, Stevenson’s efforts delayed the permitting process for an onshore substation, which in turn delayed wind turbine construction off the Delmarva coast from a planned 2022 start date to 2026 at the earliest. In January of this year, days after Trump took office for his second term, Ørsted moved to refinance the project, likely kicking it even further down the road.

Ultimately, Stevenson said, he ​“won the battle.”

In 2019, emboldened by his win against Skipjack Wind, Stevenson started searching on social media platforms and in news articles for the names of other residents across the Northeast who were resisting offshore wind farms. He reached out to some of them by phone—“just cold-called them,” he said with a laugh.

He found that there were plenty of individuals, as well as some small groups, protesting with little experience. For example, a handful of activists known as Protect Our Coast NJ didn’t know how to establish themselves as a nonprofit entity. Stevenson said he helped them do it.

Stevenson also started to organize monthly calls among activists from different states. His reach slowly grew from Massachusetts down to North Carolina, with the idea of spreading the tactics he honed in Delaware to other states. What Stevenson would bring them—as the Brown University researchers put it—was ​“political power.” Filings show that Stevenson’s employer, the Caesar Rodney Institute, also accepted donations from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers in both 2019 and 2020.

His network of grassroots activists evolved into the American Coalition for Ocean Protection, which made its public debut in 2021 with a press conference in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse. Four other State Policy Network think tanks had also joined by then.

There, wearing a blue sport coat and flanked by maps of planned wind farms, Stevenson announced that the Caesar Rodney Institute had set up a $75,000 legal fund to support residents along the East Coast who wanted to sue to halt offshore wind development. He publicly set a goal of raising $500,000 for the campaign.

Stevenson would later admit that while the coalition’s fundraising ​“did pretty well,” it never reached anywhere close to his financial goal. No matter. It was the coalition’s relentless messaging and coordination, not so much the money, that would become its greatest weapon.

In January 2023, right-wing media took an interest in whales. There had been a slew of marine mammal deaths along the East Coast in prior weeks, and conservative media put the blame on seismic surveys for the future offshore wind developments ramping up along the New Jersey coast. Fox News host Jesse Watters interviewed a leader of Protect Our Coasts NJ, a founding coalition member that Stevenson had helped become a nonprofit.

This wasn’t the first time the media had amplified baseless speculation about wind power killing whales. The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, had run a similar story in 2017. But in early 2023, the claims were getting attention from Fox, local news, and even the Associated Press.

Stevenson was in near disbelief when he heard Tucker Carlson, then a commentator on Fox News, mention offshore wind and whales in multiple segments.

Still, even then, Stevenson refused to repeat blatantly false claims about the sector’s impact on whales. He posted statements on CRI’s website that the exact harm to the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales by wind development was still ​“unknown” and told me that his official position was to ​“wait and see” what federal scientists find after investigating the recently washed-up whale carcasses.

I asked at the time if he thought the explosion of attention on whales and wind power would peter out. He replied that it would, adding that eventually all these newcomers would oppose wind farms because of ​“the economics.”

But if Stevenson didn’t personally amplify the message, he didn’t swear it off. Nor did he discourage the groups he collaborated with from peddling it. In fact, he nearly won an award for elevating the issue: In June 2023, his campaign against offshore wind was a finalist for the ​Best Issue Campaign award presented at State Policy Network’s annual meeting. (The nomination highlighted the fact that the campaign had prompted a US General Accountability Office report into the matter. That analysis, released earlier this year, found no evidence that the wind industry harms whales.)

Over time, the whale issue metastasized, coming to define political debate over offshore wind farms. Eventually, Stevenson himself embraced some of its more conspiratorial claims. In a statement posted to the Cesar Rodney Institute website in summer 2024, he wrote: ​“We have patiently waited for indisputable evidence that offshore wind is killing whales despite federal agencies repeatedly stating that no such evidence exists. It does now.”

The ​“evidence” was two documents posted online, neither of which had been peer-reviewed. One report, by the consultant Robert Rand, looked at the acoustic output of wind vessels in the US—during both seabed surveys and pile-driving activities—and claimed that the underwater noise levels were much higher than federal scientists had estimated and could result in hearing loss and ​“harassment” of whales. The second report, by a retired computer science professor, used correlation alone to link the timing of New Jersey whale deaths to local wind farm survey work.

Douglas Nowacek, a professor at Duke University leading a multiyear investigation of wind farm impacts on wildlife, discredited these conclusions.

As it stands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ​“there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause whale deaths. There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”

In fact, government data overwhelmingly links whales’ deaths to other causes. For nearly a decade, agencies have carefully documented humpbacks in the North Atlantic washing ashore at an increasing rate. The species is not endangered, but in 2016, its plummeting population warranted a government-assigned designation: an ​“unusual mortality event.”

In this ongoing phenomena, 40 percent of the dead humpback whales autopsied by experts revealed injuries that only vessels or fishing gear could inflict. The rest, according to government data, were too decomposed to determine the cause of death. Scientists generally agree that climate change, which is driving up ocean temperatures and pushing whale prey farther north, could also be playing a role in the die-off. The whales are expending more energy than ever just to catch a meal. Some juveniles have washed up emaciated.

I asked Stevenson, soon after Trump’s second inauguration, if he still trusted NOAA’s ability to objectively assess the impact of turbine development on whales, and he was clear: ​“No.”

Trump wasted no time coming after offshore wind when he took office in January 2025. On day one, he issued an anti-wind executive order that paused all permitting activity, and derided the installations as ​“big” and ​“ugly” to an indoor stadium full of supporters.

For Stevenson and a dozen others in his influential cohort, the executive order was a good step—but it wasn’t enough to simply block new projects from advancing. In February, they petitioned Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to issue stop-work orders to the installations already being built, alleging that the projects posed a risk to whales. This piggybacked off legal complaints guided by Stevenson and coalition members against Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, South Fork Wind, and Vineyard Wind 1.

And it wasn’t long before the Trump administration tried to give the Stevenson-led coalition what it wanted. All five of the offshore wind projects under construction in US waters either have been delayed by recent stop-work orders or are reportedly under threat of receiving one.

Some in the coalition opposed such moves, recognizing that stopping projects already underway would raise energy costs. Steve Haner, a senior fellow at the Virginia-based conservative think tank Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, refused to endorse Stevenson’s petition to pause the five projects under construction—objecting especially to halting America’s largest project, a 2.5-gigawatt wind farm being built off the Virginia coast.

Under a hypothetical cancellation, according to Haner, ​“the ratepayers are on the hook” for the billions in sunk costs.

Empire Wind, one of the two projects ordered to pause this year, has since resumed construction—but only after the developer, Norwegian energy firm Equinor, launched a monthlong lobbying blitz. According to Norway’s largest newspaper, the company mobilized ​“500 phone calls and meetings”—an effort employees dubbed ​“Operation Gandalf”—which helped secure a reversal from Trump.

Still, Stevenson pushed for more wins, advocating for a complete overhaul of the Interior Department’s approval process for wind. In May, he penned another letter with some coalition members to Burgum requesting those changes.

At the time Trump was reelected, BloombergNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind generating capacity to come online in America by 2035. The research group hedged that number to 21.5 gigawatts if Trump managed to repeal wind tax credits during his term.

Today, with tax credits already sent to an early grave and no new permits issued, that prediction has fallen off a cliff. BNEF downgraded its projection two months ago to just 6 gigawatts. In other words, Trump’s assault has been so effective that it’s likely no new offshore wind farms will be built here for the next decade—save for the five already under construction.

Opponents of the sector have won the war on wind in the near term. “They are clearly feeling emboldened by Donald Trump,” said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University who led the study that placed Stevenson at the heart of America’s anti-wind movement.

It’s not just Trump: Over the past year, more Republicans have grown verbally hostile to offshore wind. Burgum has played up reliability concerns, which lack evidence, and raised alarm bells about the impact to tourism and fishing, while peddling false claims that climate change predictions were overblown. This fall, the defeated Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, Jack Ciattarelli, made banishing wind farms a core agenda item, selling anti-wind tote bags and koozies on his campaign website.

Under Trump, government officials are rolling out more eyebrow-raising narratives—ones that go beyond whales—for halting wind projects. Some defy science and logic, like Burgum’s claims that New England’s Revolution Wind, the other project paused by Trump, makes the US vulnerable to underwater drone attacks. (A federal judge has since lifted the stop work order.)

Kinol, the Northeastern University researcher, says these kinds of narratives fit under the umbrella of ​“climate obstruction.” The term, she said, describes ​“the intentional use of misleading, misinforming, or misdirecting narratives to slow or prevent climate action.”

The concept has been around since the 1990s, when scholars first investigated the American Petroleum Institute’s downplaying of climate change. But as the debate about climate change—and what to do about it—evolved, so did the opposition. Kinol said talking points that preach wind farms as bad news for whales or national security are ​“a known and studied strategy.”

“This is an example of ​‘downside emphasis.’…A wind farm opponent emphasizes the downsides of renewable energy,” said Kinol. ​“The reason why it’s a well-known tactic of obstruction is because the same emphasis on protecting species is not present for the same groups when they’re talking about fossil-fuel build-out.”

These kinds of arguments are ​“disingenuous,” said Kinol, and ultimately in service of a phenomena she and her colleagues call ​“climate delay.”

Stevenson is one example of what is now a clear trend: The denial of climate change is being steadily replaced by attacks on solutions to address it. This twist is detailed in a new book written and edited by Roberts and three colleagues titled ​Climate Obstruction: A Global Assessment. The book came out in early fall, just in time for its authors to witness their ideas play out in real life, with a decade-long delay of US offshore wind farm development now becoming reality.

Nowadays, Stevenson seems to have mixed emotions about his achievements. On two of our most recent phone calls, his tenor had changed.

“​Well, I think it was the right move,” he said in early fall, referring to the Trump administration’s stop-work order pausing the building of Revolution Wind, which was still in effect when we spoke. ​“But it is not something I’m going to dance around the table happy about, because there are people that get hurt by this, that are losing their jobs.”

All his efforts have ​“paid off,” he said. America’s elevated reliance on cheap natural gas—which, when burned, releases fewer carbon emissions than coal—was ​“better policy” for now. He views gas as an essential bridge fuel until nuclear, geothermal, and solar can be built. But he expressed some ​“disappointment” that Trump has increasingly gone after solar and wants to now expand coal production.

Republican moderates in Washington have expressed similar sentiments. Meanwhile, utility bills, which Stevenson called his ​“primary motivation” for his anti-wind work, have skyrocketed in the Northeast and are projected to only climb higher if Trump’s policies continue to strangle the offshore wind sector.

Stevenson has increasingly drifted from the direction that other coalition members are taking. Protect Our Coast NJ—which first fanned the flames of misleading claims about whales—has embarked on a different disinformation campaign: spreading the false idea that offshore wind cables cause cancer. Embracing outlandish claims, whether it’s whale-killing ​“windmills” or cancer-causing cables, is a broader trend among Republicans who buy into conspiracy theories with their party’s rise to power.

Conspiratorial sentiments are plaguing other clean energy sectors, too, from exaggerated claims of bird-killing onshore turbines to markedly false statements about toxic solar panels. Anti-renewables talking points circulate online, penetrate town hall meetings, and are taken up by groups pushing back against renewables now more than ever. A June study released by Columbia University identified 498 contested wind and solar projects across 49 states in 2024, marking a 32 percent jump in opposed projects, compared to just one year prior.

“You want a healthy amount of skepticism in a democracy…You don’t want 100 percent believers,” said Dietram Scheufele, a social scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies public perspectives on science and technology. But he warned that skepticism in the US is ​“on steroids,” pushing people from the middle into polarized political camps and toward conspiratorial thinking.

Stevenson, for his part, is stepping away from his work in the anti–offshore wind movement, and seems relieved to be doing so.

On our most recent call, in late November, he told me that he had resigned from CRI and that his anti–offshore wind coalition was, for all practical purposes, disbanded. (He remains a named plaintiff in four lawsuits opposing wind development.)

He’d rather be ​“solving the nuclear waste problem,” he told me. The energy source has long had a toxic-byproduct issue, not to mention cost overruns, which, to be sure, eclipse any expense associated with offshore wind over the long run. The Trump administration is looking to revive America’s nuclear industry, and that’s where Stevenson wants to build his legacy.

Even this work advocating for nuclear power could be seen as a form of ​“climate delay,” according to a popular research framework used by Kinol and Roberts. Nuclear plants put forth today can take a decade or more to start providing power; many of the proposed wind projects that Stevenson’s coalition targeted would have come online well before then.

Stevenson also told me that he is starting a new position. Soon, he’ll become the director for energy and environmental policy at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy. This think tank, like CRI, is part of the State Policy Network. ExxonMobil and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation are among the center’s funders.

I congratulated Stevenson on his new job. He thanked me. His tone warmed as he reminded me that we’d probably had a dozen phone calls over the years.

I said it was quite possible that his legacy would be as the man who helped crush a renewable energy sector that could have done much to address the planet’s biggest problem. I asked Stevenson what he thought about that view—that readers might see it that way.

“I don’t care if people hate me or not,” he said. ​“I’m doing what I think is right.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Stevenson-hero-uncropped.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-12-12 16:01:42.204864

To alleviate the pressure, many nations, like Romania, are turning to the renewable energy sector to bring emissions down while still providing the essential energy that the populace needs for everyday life. Europe has been a welcome destination for the sector, and new data reveals the astonishing turbine orders for wind projects across the continent.

Romania is the latest European nation to express its wind energy generation ambitions

The former Soviet nation has been developing two new wind projects that will provide remarkable amounts of clean energy to the nation’s grid in the near future. Data has revealed that wind turbine orders are increasing in Europe, with GE Vernova, a US-based renewable energy company that produces turbines for the international wind market, reporting substantial increases in turbine orders.

Romania’s clean energy mix has been growing at a steady rate over the past few years. In 2023, the renewable energy mix accounted for approximately 25% of energy consumption, and the government hopes to increase that to around 30% by 2030. Romania’s two new wind farm projects will certainly play a role in the planned expansion of renewable energy usage.

GE Vernova secures substantial turbine orders for two new wind farms in Romania

The US-based energy company has entered into an agreement with Greenvolt International Power to construct, supply, and, most importantly, install 42 6.1 MW wind turbines at the Ialomiţa wind farm. The new deal also calls for an order of the same number of turbines for the all-new Gurbanesti wind farm in Călărași county, positioning Romania as the latest European nation to drastically boost wind energy production on the continent.

GE Vernova is set to provide the essential wind turbines to power Romania’s renewable energy ambitions

Through the agreement with Greenvolt, GE Vernova will install and maintain the wind turbines at the Gurbanesti and Ialomiţa wind farms in Romania. The Ialomiţa wind farm will be capable of generating upwards of 252 MW of clean energy, while the Gurbanesti wind farm will add a further estimated 250 MW to the national grid.

Together, the wind farms will contribute 500 MW of clean wind energy to the national grid, accelerating Romania’s clean energy targets set for 2030. Both wind farms will provide thousands of ordinary Romanians with employment during peak construction, and generate enough electricity to power up to 110,000 Romanian homes and businesses every year. Europe’s proclivity for wind power has led to several nations embracing the sector, some for the first time.

“We appreciate the confidence that Greenvolt has shown in GE Vernova’s teams and our technology. This project reinforces the value of our workhorse product strategy and demonstrates our ability to add value for customers in Romania and across Europe.” – Gilan Sabatier, Chief Commercial Officer for GE Vernova’s Onshore Wind business in International Markets

Europe is aiming to increase reliance on the wind energy market in the new year

2026 is shaping up to be the best year in recent memory for the wind power sector. Europe has been embracing the clean energy potential of the wind power sector at a remarkable pace in recent months, as evidenced by the new Dogger Bank wind project in the United Kingdom, which recently reported that the foundation work for the project has been completed. A new year brings with it a renewed sense of optimism for the international energy industry, as the vast majority of nations, particularly in Europe, have big plans to increase investments in clean energy production.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/43-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:16.793660

The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, grant program funds infrastructure projects for communities vulnerable to natural disasters.

“Our towns spent years doing everything FEMA asked them to do to qualify for this funding, and they were in the middle of building real protections against storms when FEMA suddenly broke its word,” wrote Attorney General Jeff Jackson in a press release. “Keeping water systems working and keeping homes out of floodwater isn’t politics – it’s basic safety. This ruling puts the money back where it was promised so these communities can be ready for the next storm.”

In April, FEMA abruptly canceled the program, leaving many projects in North Carolina — including sewer upgrades, river bank maintenance and wastewater projects — to an uncertain fate. In response, North Carolina, along with 19 other states, sued the agency in July.

This week, the court sided with the states and ruled that the termination of the BRIC program is “unlawful.” The reprogramming or withholding of funds already committed to projects also violates the law, it said.

“This is a case about unlawful Executive encroachment on the prerogative of Congress to appropriate funds for a specific and compelling purpose, and no more than that,” the summary judgement stated.

In North Carolina, some of the reinstated grants include:

A $22.5 million grant to relocate a sewage station out of the floodplain in Salisbury

A $5.9 million riverbank restoration in Gastonia

A $5.4 million grant for flood protection in Hickory

A $7.6 million Resilient Wastewater Treatment Infrastructure project in Forest City

A $1.1 million sewer system relocation in Leland

A $200,000 watershed vulnerability assessment in Buncombe County

Egypt and Nigeria are pursuing hydrogen and clean energy projects.","Since early 2023, Chinese companies have pledged more than $180 billion for clean energy projects outside China, marking a major shift in global energy investment. These firms produce most of the world’s solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles, and they are investing in complete supply chains that cover mining, manufacturing, and recycling. By helping other countries build renewable energy systems, China is not only boosting green power adoption but also shaping trade and industrial flows across the globe.

China leads this change with large factories, low costs, and careful planning. The government encourages companies to expand abroad, focusing on countries with high energy needs and supporting agreements to share technology. From 2018 to 2024, China controlled 80% of new solar, wind, battery, and hydrogen plants worldwide. Companies such as CATL and BYD dominate production, exporting billions in technology each year. Chinese firms cover entire supply chains, from mines to factories, battery plants, recycling centers, and renewable energy projects, ensuring efficiency and long-term influence. Trade agreements and political partnerships help these companies expand quickly, while technology sharing and faster approvals support large-scale projects.

The Global South is a major focus of China’s investments. Over 75% of projects are in developing countries, often aligned with the Belt and Road Initiative. China selects locations with clear policies, strict rules, and high energy demand. Many projects are joint ventures with local partners, sharing jobs, skills, and technology. Governments support these efforts with loans and incentives, while private firms lead development. These investments help lower energy costs, create thousands of jobs, upgrade grids, and promote industrial growth. China also adapts to local regulations, meeting requirements for labor, content, or training, which ensures contracts move forward smoothly.

In Southeast Asia, the growth is notable. Indonesia is seeing a $6 billion battery plant by CATL in West Java, producing 6.9 GWh annually and creating over 10,000 jobs. Malaysia has investments from EVE Energy and BYD in energy storage and EV manufacturing, while solar farms expand with GCL Technology’s support. Thailand benefits from Sunwoda’s $1 billion battery plant and Changan’s EV research partnerships. Tax breaks, fast permits, and local content rules accelerate projects, boost trade with China, and strengthen regional energy systems.

The Middle East is also transforming. Saudi Arabia has a $1.1 billion solar farm with Shanghai Electric, Morocco hosts a $5.6 billion battery plant by Gotion, and Oman produces solar cells at JA Solar’s $564 million plant. Egypt and Nigeria are pursuing hydrogen and clean energy projects. These initiatives reduce energy costs, generate employment, and advance national energy goals.

Europe is part of this expansion as well. Hungary’s Debrecen plant by CATL aims to produce 100 GWh of batteries annually, Spain hosts a $4.1 billion battery factory in Zaragoza, and France’s Douai plant targets 40 GWh by 2030. These facilities help meet EV electrification goals and provide local training and research opportunities, supporting regional industrial growth.

Latin America is seeing similar trends. Brazil’s BYD converts a Ford plant into an EV hub, producing 150,000 cars in the first phase, while Envision develops a net-zero industrial park. Chinese firms support wind, solar, and hydro projects, upgrade grids, and lower energy costs by around 20%, speeding the transition to renewable energy.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/10-4.png,N,,2025-12-12 19:01:06.849896

“App-based workers work long hours, often with no consistency or predictability of how much they will make,” said Rep. Jayapal.
App-based corporations have hidden behind AI algorithms and predatory take rates while drivers’ pay shrinks and executive profits soar,” said Rep. Omar.
“The Empowering App-Based Workers Act will pull back the curtain on how these companies use data, set wages, and make decisions that shape people’s livelihoods.
Gig workers should be part of a transparent system that values their labor.” App-based workers face increasingly exploitative conditions.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – DECEMBER 12, 2025 — Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12) joined Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Donald Norcross (NJ-01), and Ilhan Omar (MN-05) in introducing the Empowering App-Based Workers Act, groundbreaking legislation to bring transparency, fairness, and accountability to digital labor platforms such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Amazon Flex.

The bill establishes critical guardrails to ensure that automated decision-making systems do not result in discrimination, wage theft, or price-gouging — and that the workers who keep these companies running have the information and protections they deserve.

“App-based workers in Western Pennsylvania and across this country power our economy, yet far too many are left without basic transparency, stability, or fair pay,” said Congresswoman Summer Lee. “These companies use hidden algorithms and unpredictable pay structures that make it nearly impossible for workers to support their families. The Empowering App-Based Workers Act brings long-overdue accountability by requiring companies to be transparent about how they determine pay and assignments. Workers deserve protection from unfair and exploitative practices, and they deserve to receive their fair share of the value they create.”

Other lead sponsors emphasized the urgent need for reform.

“App-based workers work long hours, often with no consistency or predictability of how much they will make,” said Rep. Jayapal. “They are at the whim of algorithms that make automated decisions about who gets to work, and where, and when. Workers and consumers deserve a better system, where workers are protected, employment laws are followed, and where consumers have a transparent price.”

“The Empowering App-Based Workers Act is a long-overdue step toward fairness and transparency for the millions of rideshare drivers and delivery app workers who keep our economy running,” said Rep. Norcross. “By guaranteeing transparent payment information and higher wages, these workers will finally receive a fair day’s pay for a hard day’s work. App-based workers deserve a good-paying job where they are treated with dignity, compensated fairly, and protected from exploitation.”

“Gig workers like Uber and Lyft drivers in my home state of Minnesota deserve a fair share of the wealth they create. App-based corporations have hidden behind AI algorithms and predatory take rates while drivers’ pay shrinks and executive profits soar,” said Rep. Omar. “The Empowering App-Based Workers Act will pull back the curtain on how these companies use data, set wages, and make decisions that shape people’s livelihoods. Gig workers should be part of a transparent system that values their labor.”

App-based workers face increasingly exploitative conditions. In 2024, both Uber and Lyft regularly paid drivers less than minimum wage — even while raising prices for consumers. Corporate take rates frequently hover around 40 percent and can reach as high as 70 percent on individual rides.

The Empowering App-Based Workers Act will:

Require weekly pay statements and itemized receipts so workers know exactly how their earnings are calculated;

Require transparency on electronic monitoring and automated decision-making, including how algorithms determine job assignments;

Guarantee ride-hail drivers receive at least 75% of the total amount paid by the consumer;

Prohibit pay discrimination by ensuring equal pay for equal or comparable work.

In addition to Reps. Jayapal, Norcross, Omar, and Lee, the legislation is sponsored by Reps. Dan Goldman (NY-10), LaMonica McIver (NJ-10), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-AL), Mark Pocan (WI-02), Mark Takano (CA-39), and Rashida Tlaib (MI-12).",https://summerlee.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-12 15:00:58.759950

The market, not the courtroom, should decide America’s energy future.","A quiet but important shift is taking place in conservative energy policy. Across the center-right, a growing number of U.S. policymakers, business leaders, and investors are returning to classical principles — recognizing that markets, not government intervention, are the best way to secure America’s energy future.

That’s what makes Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s lawsuit against major asset managers so misguided. The lawsuit accuses firms like BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard of conspiring to limit investment in coal. But what’s really being challenged is the freedom of investors to make market-based decisions about risk, technology and opportunity. Paxton isn’t fighting overreach. He’s fighting capitalism itself.

For generations, conservatives have argued that free enterprise and limited government produce better outcomes than top-down control. In the 2010s, the American Tea Party movement rose by explicitly campaigning against big-government mandates — from Common Core to the Affordable Care Act to Wall Street bailouts. Whether you agree with the movement or not, Paxton’s effort flips that logic on its head, substituting the judgment of politicians for that of investors and consumers. Using the power of the state to punish private firms as Texas and other states are trying to do for assessing market realities undermines the very principles of free enterprise conservatives have long defended.

Conservatives across the country are speaking up. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who served as President Trump’s Energy Secretary, has called Paxton’s lawsuit “misguided,” warning that it will undermine President Trump’s energy agenda. He’s right.

The reality is that investors are responding to economics, not ideology. Renewable energy, like wind and solar, have become more competitive and cost-effective. It is why investment in clean energy globally is expected to top $2.2 trillion by the end of the year. Emerging technologies are gaining traction. Markets reward efficiency and innovation, and they penalize waste and stagnation. When the government steps in to dictate how capital should be deployed, it distorts these signals and increases costs for everyone.

If the goal is to strengthen America’s energy leadership, the path forward isn’t litigation, it’s certainty. China is moving full speed ahead to dominate global clean energy manufacturing and electric vehicles. Investors, utilities, companies, and developers need stable policy and predictable rules to plan decades-long projects. Permitting reform, consistent tax policy, and clear regulatory standards will do far more to unleash American energy investment than courtroom battles waged by politicians with a vendetta.

Investment is already flowing. Across the country clean energy projects are expanding, many of them in Republican-represented districts. These projects aren’t ideological. They’re about job creation, reliable power, and economic competitiveness. As demand for electricity grows — driven by data centers, electric vehicles, and industrial production — the United States must bring more generation onto the grid. Every credible forecast shows that we will need more energy sources to meet that demand.

This is where conservatives have a clear advantage. A market-driven energy agenda doesn’t require choosing between fossil fuels and renewables. It simply requires letting competition decide which technologies deliver the most affordable, reliable, and secure energy. That approach aligns perfectly with conservative values: economic freedom, property rights, and limited government.

The language conservatives use also matters. Energy security, reliability, and economic growth are the winning arguments. Last month, I joined a group of former Republican members of Congress to push this message home: American competitiveness depends on abundant, affordable energy. If we fail to provide it, electricity prices will rise for everyone, industries will leave, and our geopolitical strength will weaken.

The choice before conservatives is straightforward. We can embrace a forward-looking, pro-market energy strategy that builds on our strengths — or we can drift toward using government power to pick winners and punish others because of politics. The former leads to innovation and growth. The latter leads to stagnation and uncertainty.

Conservatives built their legacy by trusting markets, empowering entrepreneurs, and limiting government interference. It’s time to apply those same principles to energy. The market, not the courtroom, should decide America’s energy future.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/5e/35eed9f3-41dd-4535-8ed0-eccdcc7a4bd4/68dad702605e3.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:31.342692

To sum up, Fervo Energy, backed by strong investment, is at the forefront of this boom, driving reliable, 24/7 clean energy across the U.S.","Next-generation geothermal energy is moving from the margins to the center of the clean power conversation. Analysts say technology improvements and rising demand for 24/7 clean electricity are opening the door for geothermal to scale in ways that were not possible before. Annick Adjei, senior research analyst for upstream and subsurface carbon management at Wood Mackenzie, summed it up clearly. She said next-gen geothermal was “fundamentally changing the energy landscape” by making a reliable, around-the-clock clean power source available in far more places than before.

That momentum is already showing up in the money. The geothermal sector attracted US$1.7 billion in funding in Q1 2025 alone, a signal of strong confidence from investors looking for firm clean energy solutions. Against this backdrop, Fervo Energy—the leading name in next-generation geothermal—announced the close of its oversubscribed US$462 million Series E round, led by new investor B Capital. The scale of the raise reflects the growing belief that geothermal could play a crucial role in building a fully decarbonized energy grid.

Fervo Gets Funding Boost to Scale the World’s Largest Next-Gen Geothermal Project

The new capital will speed up Fervo’s development plans, especially the buildout of Cape Station in Beaver County, Utah. Cape Station is on track to become the largest next-generation geothermal development in the world. The facility will start delivering 100 megawatts (MW) of firm clean electricity to the grid in 2026. Fervo plans to add another 400 MW by 2028, bringing total capacity to 500 MW.

Construction has been progressing rapidly, driven by significant operational improvements. Drilling times have fallen with every new well, and overall efficiency has climbed. These improvements help bring costs down and reduce development risk, which is critical as utilities and grid operators look for stable sources of clean power.

At the same time, the United States’ power sector is facing a major turning point. Electricity demand is rising rapidly due to electrification, the growth of data centers, and the expansion in advanced manufacturing. Yet supply has not kept pace. This mismatch is creating a once-in-a-generation chance for new energy resources to break in.

Investor Confidence Continues to Rise

Fervo continues to attract top-tier investors who view geothermal as the next scalable zero-carbon resource. The Series E round drew a wide mix of new and returning backers. New investors included AllianceBernstein, Atacama Ventures, Carbon Equity, Climate First, Google, Mitsui & Co., Dr. Kris Singh of Holtec International, and JB Straubel. Returning supporters such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures, CalSTRS, Capricorn Investment Group, CPP Investments, DCVC, Devon Energy, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries also joined.

Centaurus Capital’s participation was notable. The firm recently made a US$75 million preferred equity commitment to support Cape Station Phase I and also joined the latest round. The ongoing interest highlights how geothermal is increasingly appealing to both climate-focused funds and traditional energy investors.

Geothermal: A Clean Energy Source With Minimal Environmental Footprint

Environmental impacts vary depending on how geothermal energy is used. Direct-use systems and geothermal heat pumps have almost no negative environmental effects and often reduce the need for more polluting energy sources. Even geothermal power plants—which do generate some emissions—produce fewer pollutants compared to fossil fuel plants.

Because geothermal plants don’t burn fuel, emissions are low.

EIA says they release 97% fewer sulfur compounds and around 99% less carbon dioxide than similarly sized coal or gas plants.

Many facilities also use scrubbers to capture hydrogen sulfide from the geothermal reservoir. Most geothermal plants inject used steam and water back underground, which helps renew the resource and keeps surface emissions close to zero.

Fervo Launches a New Standard for Responsible Geothermal Development

As geothermal development accelerates, Fervo is working to ensure that growth happens responsibly. The company introduced the Geothermal Sustainable Development Pact, a new framework outlining best-in-class standards for planning, building, and operating geothermal projects. The Pact includes 37 commitments across six key areas:

Community engagement

Workforce development

Land use

Water conservation and well integrity

Induced seismicity

Emissions

The Pact goes beyond existing regulatory rules and sets a new bar for responsible geothermal scaling. It also builds on the Principles for Responsible Geothermal Development, which Fervo co-developed with the Sierra Club and which has been endorsed by the Sierra Club and the NW Energy Coalition.

Tim Latimer, Fervo’s CEO and Co-Founder, said the Pact came from the belief that the future of energy needs “not just better technology, but better practices.” He emphasized that collaboration with environmental groups will continue as the framework evolves.

Global Capacity and Geothermal’s Path to a Larger U.S. Grid Role

As per REN21’s latest analysis, Global geothermal electricity generation reached 99 terawatt-hours in 2024. During the same year, the world added 400 MW of new capacity, bringing total installed capacity to about 15.1 gigawatts (GW). New Zealand led growth, followed by strong progress in the Philippines, Türkiye, Indonesia, the United States, and Japan.

Next-generation geothermal is attracting attention because it addresses one of the biggest barriers facing conventional geothermal: geography. Traditional geothermal depends on rare underground conditions that exist only in certain regions. But improvements in drilling, well design, and subsurface analytics are allowing developers to tap heat resources in many more places.

Moving on, according to McKinsey, falling costs, rapid scaling potential, and strong supply chains could help geothermal become a major part of the U.S. energy mix.

Their analysis suggests next-generation geothermal could supply up to 100 GW of power by 2050, including 40 GW by 2035. That would represent a meaningful share of firm, zero-carbon electricity on the U.S. grid.

Costs are also expected to drop. Analysts project next-generation geothermal could reach US$45–65 per megawatt-hour for mature, “nth-of-a-kind” facilities within the next decade. While local economic conditions will influence individual project viability, geothermal is expected to outperform other forms of clean, firm power over time.

U.S. Policy, New Wells, and Record Investments Fuel a Geothermal Boom

Under the Trump administration, many renewables face challenges, but geothermal could benefit from a “drill, baby, drill” approach, since it shares techniques with oil and gas. With careful policy support, investment in geothermal could grow significantly.

As of 2025, the U.S. holds 23% of global geothermal capacity, leading the world with 3.7 GW in operation. The latest Global Geothermal Power Tracker shows 223 units in development, adding over 15 GW—almost doubling global capacity if completed.

Furthermore, Annick Adjei also highlighted the opportunity: an 80% jump in new wells and nearly US$2 billion in investment show strong confidence in tapping the nation’s vast heat resources. With 500 GW of potential and only 4 GW installed, geothermal could rival traditional oil and gas while delivering always-on, clean power.

It is imperative that the federal government continue to provide funding directly to municipalities that own and manage portions of the country’s infrastructure.","With the four-year anniversary of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) in November, NLC released Rebuilding Together: Examining Federal Funding for Municipal Infrastructure, which highlights how communities of all sizes across the country benefited with an estimated $12.7 billion in IIJA funds awarded to municipalities through federal agencies and state offices.

NLC’s report comes as House and Senate leaders are preparing reauthorization packages for surface transportation and water infrastructure programs before they expire in October 2026. The upcoming reauthorization serves as an opportunity to continue the investment in America’s infrastructure, and NLC has outlined key local government priorities for both transportation and water reauthorization (PDF).

Given IIJA’s significance as a source of funding for infrastructure, NLC examined the flow of funding to the municipal level to help inform Congressional reauthorization discussions.

The analysis shows that federal-to-local direct awards remain the most efficient way to ensure municipal governments, particularly large cities, receive funding to address infrastructure needs quickly and completely.

Rebuilding Together

Through a mix of direct grants from the federal government, formula funding sent to states and federal loans, federal infrastructure programs play a significant role in enabling cities, towns and villages across the country to develop and sustain assets that serve residents and businesses and grow local and national economies.

The report’s key finding is that smaller municipalities (those under 50,000 in population) come out ahead when it comes to receiving IIJA funds. However, they still need federal partners to continue funding support for infrastructure projects and efforts to reduce administrative burdens in applying and managing federal grants.

At the state level, the report examines four infrastructure programs in six states (Alaska, Connecticut, Michigan, Tennessee, Louisiana and Utah). From the state’s block grant programs funded under IIJA, just under half of funds went to municipalities.

While municipalities received $8.6 billion in direct federal funds from IIJA, cities, towns and villages received minimal funding under pass-through state transportation programs, leaving them at a disadvantage for fixing infrastructure assets. By comparison, state energy and environment offices that distributed funding for energy and water projects together allocated more than 70 percent of their funding to municipalities.

On 22 November 2025, Decree-Law No. 175 of 21 November 2025 (known as the Energy Decree) came into force. It contains “Urgent measures concerning Transition Plan 5.0 and energy production from renewable sources” (Official Gazette No. 271 of 21 November 2025).

The Energy Decree contains significant changes to the regulations concerning:

tax credits for new investments in production facilities in Italy, as part of innovation projects that result in a reduction in energy consumption pursuant to Article 38 of Decree-Law No. 19 of 2 March 2024, converted, with amendments, by Law No. 56 of 29 April 2024;

the eligible areas referred to in Legislative Decree 199/2021 (Eligible Areas) and the authorisation regimes introduced by Legislative Decree 190/2024 (TU FER) for the construction and operation of plants powered by renewable sources.

With regard to the amendments to Legislative Decree 199/2021, the provisions “rewrite”

Articles 20, 21, 22 and 23 of Legislative Decree 199/2021. They only partially confirm the previous regulations and leave it to the reader to verify which changes have been introduced.

The previous suitable areas have been partially confirmed and new areas have been classified as suitable areas. The suitable area for photovoltaic plants, which referred to the previous c-ter, no. 2) of Article 20 of Legislative Decree 199/2021, has been modified for the worse.

Another new feature is the determination of the criteria for regions and autonomous provinces to identify additional suitable areas to those established in the Energy Decree. Regions and provinces can’t modify or eliminate these areas.

The absence of a transitional regime regarding the application of this new, more restrictive regulation to ongoing authorisation procedures is questionable, also in light of the criterion of the prevalence of the unsuitability of the area in cases where the plant only partially falls within a suitable area (see paragraph i. below).

Consider a photovoltaic plant with a capacity of less than 10 MW currently undergoing authorisation through PAS located in an agricultural area within 500 m of an industrial plant not subject to AIA. In the absence of a transitional regime, it’s debatable whether the previous regulations still apply. So whether the authorisation can be finalised under the tempus regit actionem principle.

No provision has repealed Article 15 of Legislative Decree 190/2024, which establishes the tempus regit actionem principle, which should also apply to the amendments subsequently introduced by the Energy Decree. Otherwise, the authorisation procedures currently underway would be invalidated without any safeguard for investments already made.

Repealing Article 20 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 has removed the need to adopt the ministerial decree provided for by the same provision. This means that all pending disputes concerning this ministerial decree will be deemed irrelevant, also taking into account that the criteria for identifying suitable areas by the regions/provinces identified by the Energy Decree Law incorporate the jurisprudential guidelines established on regional laws and on the Ministerial Decree on suitable areas (see below, paragraph g.). The regions/provinces have 120 days to introduce this regulation.

The Energy Decree Law, in force since 22 November 2025, must be converted into law within 60 days, ie by 20 January 2026.

The following paragraphs illustrate the new provisions introduced by the Energy Decree Law and offer preliminary comments on their implications for application.

Tax credits referred to in the transition plan 5.0

Article 1 of the Energy Decree Law concerns the tax credit referred to in Transition Plan 5.0.

A time window is provided for submitting ex ante communications before investment, with peremptory deadlines and limitations on the completion of the procedure for using the tax credit.

27 November 2025 is the final deadline for submitting communications (to be sent electronically on the basis of a standardised form provided by Gestore dei Servizi Energetici s.p.a (GSE)) concerning the description of the investment project and its cost. The submission should have certifications issued by an independent assessor attesting ex ante the reduction in energy consumption achievable through investments in eligible assets.

If communications are submitted from 7 November 2025 until 6 pm on 27 November 2025 with incorrectly uploaded data or with incomplete or illegible documentation or information, they can be supplemented, at the request of the GSE, by the applicant companies, within the deadline indicated in the communication and in any case by 6 December 2025.

If companies don’t comply with requests for additional information or rectification within these terms, the procedure for claiming the tax credit not being completed. In any case, the lack of elements relating to the certification of energy consumption reduction provided for in Article 15, paragraph 1, letter a) of the Ministerial Decree of 24 July 2024 (see The reduction in energy consumption referred to in Article 9 shall be certified by specific technical certifications issued by one or more independent assessors in the form of sworn expert reports which, with regard to the eligibility of the innovation project and the completion of the investments, certify: a) ex ante, the reduction in energy consumption achievable through investments in the assets referred to in Article 6)1.

To avoid incurring the prohibition on cumulation, companies can choose, by 27 November 2025, the tax credit referred to in Transition Plan 5.0. The company will have to submit, for the same assets covered by the subsidy, an application for access to the tax credit for investments in new capital goods referred to in Article 1, paragraphs 1051 et seq. of Law No. 178 of 30 December 2020.

If the benefit isn’t recognised because the expenditure limit has been exceeded, subject to verification of the necessary requirements, the right to access the tax credit for investments in new capital goods will be unaffected, within the limits of the resources provided for by current legislation for the tax credit.

Controls and supervision are entrusted to the GSE, which, having ascertained that the conditions for benefiting from the benefit haven’t been met, will take measures to cancel the tax credit reservation and notify the Revenue Agency.

Corrections to the TU FER and suitable areas

a. Definition of ‘Agrivoltaic System’ and Exclusion from Prohibitions in Agricultural Areas

Article 2 of the Energy Decree Law introduces the definition of “agrivoltaic system” into Legislative Decree 190/2024. Specifically, letter f-bis) is added to Article 4, which refers to “agrivoltaic system: a photovoltaic system that preserves the continuity of farming and pastoral activities at the installation site. In order to ensure the continuity of farming and pastoral activities, the system may provide for the rotation of modules placed at a height above the ground and the application of digital and precision farming tools.”

The introduction of this definition entails recognising the “Agrivoltaic Plant” as a distinct and autonomous category with respect to photovoltaic plants with ground-mounted modules in agricultural areas and the inapplicability to the same of the limitations provided for this type of photovoltaic plant, as identified in paragraph 2 of Article 11-bis of the Energy Decree Law (see below, paragraph c.). The provision supplements the provisions of the TU FER, which already considered agrivoltaic systems as a separate category in terms of applicable authorisation and environmental procedures, as opposed to photovoltaic systems tout court.

The provision doesn’t refer to the CREA-GSE guidelines, which are still the benchmark for the sole purpose of agrivoltaic systems’ access to GSE incentives. With regard, in particular, to access to the support mechanism for innovative agrivoltaic systems referred to in Decree No. 436 of 22 December 2023 of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security, the objective and subjective requirements set out in the GSE Operating Regulations remain valid.

b. The ‘suitable areas’ on land immediately applicable

Article 20 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 on suitable areas is replaced by Article 11 bis of the same Legislative Decree.

The replacement means that some suitable areas already provided for in the previous Article 20, paragraph 8 are confirmed, while other suitable areas are added and others are modified for the worse.

Compared to the previous Article 20, paragraph 8 of Legislative Decree 199/2021, the following areas are confirmed as “suitable”:

areas where systems from the same source are already installed, provided that the modification/renovation work doesn’t involve a change in the area occupied of more than 20%, except for photovoltaic systems on agricultural land, for which no change in area is permitted;

areas of sites subject to remediation identified pursuant to Title V of Part IV of Legislative Decree No. 152 of 3 April 2006;

quarries and mines that are no longer in operation, have not been reclaimed or have been abandoned or are in a state of environmental degradation, or portions of quarries and mines that are not suitable for further exploitation;

landfills or landfill lots that have been closed or restored2;

sites and facilities owned by companies belonging to the Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane group and railway infrastructure operators, as well as motorway concession companies;

sites and facilities available to airport management companies within airport grounds, including those within the perimeter of the airports of the smaller islands referred to in Annex 1 to the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development of 14 February 2017, published in the Official Gazette No. 114 of 18 May 2017, without prejudice to the necessary technical checks by the National Civil Aviation Authority;

The following “suitable areas” have been added, which are new with respect to Article 20:

a) military property or property used for any purpose by the Ministry of Defence referred to in Article 20 of Decree-Law No. 17 of 1 March 2022, converted, with amendments, by Law No. 34 of 27 April 2022, for the purposes set out therein3;

b) property owned by the State or used for any reason by the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice and judicial offices, referred to in Article 10 of Decree-Law No. 144 of 23 September 2022, converted, with amendments, by Law No. 175 of 17 November 2022;

c) real estate identified by the State Property Agency, after consultation with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, owned by the State, not covered by development or disposal programmes under its jurisdiction, as well as State property identified by the same Agency in agreement with the user administrations, in use by the same, pursuant to Article 16 of Decree-Law No. 13 of 24 February 2023, No. 13, converted, with amendments, by Law No. 41 of 21 April 2023;

With reference to photovoltaic systems, in addition to the areas referred to in the previous points, with respect to the previous Article 20 of Legislative Decree 199/2021:

These suitable areas have been confirmed:

d) areas adjacent to the motorway network within a distance not exceeding 300 metres;

These suitable areas have been added:

e) buildings and structures and their appurtenant external areas;

f) areas intended for industrial, administrative, craft, commercial use, or for logistics or data processing centres;

g) areas used for car parks, limited to covered structures;

h) water reservoirs, quarry lakes and disused mines or mines in a state of environmental degradation;

i) plants and related areas falling within the perimeter of the integrated water service.

These suitable areas have been modified:

j) areas within industrial plants and facilities not intended for agricultural production as referred to in Article 268, paragraph 1, letter h) and l) of Legislative Decree 152/2006, subject to integrated environmental authorisation pursuant to Title III-bis of Legislative Decree 152/2006, as well as areas classified as agricultural enclosed within a perimeter whose points are no more than 350 metres from the same plant or facility.

The suitable areas that were in the previous Article 20, paragraph 8 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 have been eliminated:

c-ter) point 1) exclusively for photovoltaic plants, including ground-mounted modules, in the absence of restrictions pursuant to Part II of the Code of Cultural Heritage and Landscape, referred to in Legislative Decree No. 42 of 22 January 2004, areas classified as agricultural, enclosed within a perimeter whose points are no more than 500 metres from areas designated for industrial, craft and commercial areas, including sites of national interest, as well as quarries and mines;

and c-quater), even though c-quater constitutes a criterion on which the Regions will be called upon to identify suitable areas.

With regard to biomethane production plants, in addition to the areas referred to in points (a) to (i) above, the following areas are confirmed as suitable:

k) areas classified as agricultural enclosed within a perimeter whose points are no more than 500 m from industrial, craft and commercial areas, including sites of national interest;

l) areas within industrial plants and facilities referred to in Article 268, paragraph 1, letter h) and l) of Legislative Decree 152/2006, subject to integrated environmental authorisation pursuant to Title III-bis of Legislative Decree 152/2006, as well as areas classified as agricultural enclosed within a perimeter whose points are no more than 500 m from the same plant or facility;

m) areas adjacent to the motorway network within a distance of no more than 300 m.

On the basis of the above, we observe that:

the new provision in Article 11-bis of the TU FER contains the new list of areas suitable by law for the installation of RES plants, as Article 20, paragraph 8 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 has been repealed and replaced by this provision;

with regard to areas suitable for the installation of photovoltaic plants, there has been a reduction in the number of suitable areas provided for in the previous Article 20, paragraph 8 of Legislative Decree 199/2021, given that the following are suitable (i) areas within the industrial plants and facilities referred to in Article 268, paragraph 1, letter h) and (l) of Legislative Decree 152/2006, subject to integrated environmental authorisation pursuant to Title III-bis of Legislative Decree 152/2006, and (ii) areas classified as agricultural enclosed within a perimeter whose points are no more than 350 m from the same plant or factory: Article 20, on the other hand, provided for a distance of 500 m between agricultural areas and industrial plants or establishments and didn’t contain any reference to the fact that the industrial establishments or plants to be considered for the purposes of the suitability of the area had to be subject to integrated environmental authorisation, which allowed for the inclusion – by way of interpretation – photovoltaic plants with a capacity exceeding 20 kW and wind farms to be included in the definition of industrial plants;

new areas suitable for the installation of biomethane production plants were introduced.

The absence of a transitional regime regarding the application of this new, more restrictive regulation to ongoing authorisation procedures is questionable, also in light of the criterion of the prevalence of the unsuitability of the area in cases where the plant falls only partially within a suitable area (see paragraph i. below).

Consider a photovoltaic plant with a capacity of less than 10 MW undergoing authorisation through PAS located in an agricultural area within 500 m of an industrial plant not subject to AIA. In this case, in the absence of a transitional regime, the tempus regit actionem principle expressly regulated by Article 15 of Legislative Decree 190/2024 could be invoked. It would be desirable for the conversion law to clarify the application of the tempus regit actionem principle.

c. Prohibitions on ground-mounted photovoltaic systems in agricultural areas

Article 2, paragraph 1, letter h) of the Energy Decree transcribes Article 5 of the Agriculture Decree, which introduced paragraph 1 bis into Article 20 of Legislative Decree 199/2021, and introduces paragraph 2 of Article 11-bis of the TU FER.

The provision merely confirms the prohibition on the installation of ground-mounted photovoltaic systems in areas classified as agricultural by current urban plans, with the exception of the following cases: in the areas referred to in paragraph 1, letters a), limited to interventions for the modification, renovation, upgrading or complete reconstruction of already installed systems, provided that they don’t involve an increase in the area occupied, c), d), e), f), l), numbers 1) and 2).

This provision doesn’t apply to the following cases:

projects involving ground-mounted photovoltaic systems aimed at building a renewable energy community within the meaning of Article 31 of Legislative Decree 199/2021;

projects implementing other investment measures of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), ie projects necessary for the achievement of the PNRR objectives;

projects for the construction of agrivoltaic systems, as defined by the new letter f-bis) of Article 4 of the TU FER – ie agrivoltaic plants that preserve the continuity of cultivation and pastoral activities on the installation site, including the rotation of modules placed at a height above the ground and the application of digital and precision farming tools – through the use of modules placed at a suitably high position above the ground.

This latest provision is a new development and is welcomed, as it clearly excludes both “basic” and “advanced” agrivoltaic systems from the prohibition laid down therein.

This provision also doesn’t provide for a transitional regime for authorisation procedures that are ongoing or have already been initiated, unlike the previous Article 5 of the Agriculture Decree Law.

The provision risks being unconstitutional, given that the Constitutional Court is already examining the previous (similar) a priori ban introduced by Article 5 of the Agriculture Decree Law.

d. Admissibility of RES plants in ‘free activity’ in UNESCO site protection areas

The Energy Decree also introduces Article 11-quinquies into the TU FER, according to which, within UNESCO site protection areas, installing renewable energy plants is permitted only for the interventions referred to in Annex A of the TU FER, ie interventions subject to the free building activity regime.

The use of the adverb “limitedly” in identifying the construction of renewable energy plants permitted in UNESCO sites only for projects falling within category A seems to imply a ban on installing, in these sites, of the categories of projects referred to in Annexes B and C of the TU FER and therefore of projects that can be approved with PAS and single authorisation. This interpretation is also supported by the new Article 11 bis, paragraph 4, letter d) of the TU FER which, in identifying the guiding criteria that the Regions and Autonomous Provinces must comply with when adopting their own laws on suitable areas, provides for the impossibility of establishing general and abstract prohibitions on installing renewable energy plants, “without prejudice” to the prohibition on installing photovoltaic plants in agricultural areas referred to in Article 11-bis, paragraph 2 (except for the exceptions provided for) and the provisions of Article 11-quinquies under consideration.

e. Granting concessions for suitable areas on sites and plants available to motorway concessionaires

Motorway concessionaires entrust the concession of suitable areas on sites at their disposal, subject to the determination of the relevant fees, on the basis of public procedures. This is initiated at the request of a party, with the publication of a notice, in compliance with the principles of transparency, impartiality and proportionality, ensuring conditions of effective competition.

The notices have to define, in a clear, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory manner, the subjective requirements for participation and the criteria for selecting applications, and the maximum duration of sub-concessions.

If the conditions set out in Article 76(2)(a) of the code referred to in Legislative Decree No 36 of 31 March 2023 are met, concession companies may award the suitable areas referred to in paragraph 1, letter e) of this article by means of sub-concession to subsidiaries or affiliates to ensure the necessary coordination of work on the network under management and the resolution of interference.

Subsidiaries or affiliates have to award works, services and supplies on the basis of public tender procedures, in accordance with the principles of transparency, impartiality and proportionality, ensuring conditions of effective competition. The duration of sub-concession agreements are determined on the basis of the useful life of the facilities and the investments necessary for their construction and management and may exceed the duration of the motorway concession, without prejudice to the possibility for the concessionaire taking over the management to terminate the sub-concession agreement by paying compensation equal to the investments made that haven’t been fully amortised.

f. ‘Suitable areas’ for offshore plants immediately enforceable

With regard to offshore plants for the production of energy from renewable sources, including the measures referred to in Annex C, Section II, letter v) of the TU FER, the regulation rewrites (by introducing Article 11-ter into the TU FER) the previous Article 23 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 and confirms that the areas identified by the maritime space management plans pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) and (5) of Legislative Decree 201/2017 and Prime Ministerial Decree No. 19/2018 are suitable.

It confirms that the following are considered suitable:

disused oil platforms and areas 2 nautical miles from each platform, without prejudice to the provisions of Ministerial Decree of 15 February 2019;

ports, for wind farms up to 100 MW, subject to any amendments to the port master plan, where necessary, to be adopted within six months of the submission of the single authorisation application.

g. ‘Suitable areas’ to be identified by the Regions or Autonomous Provinces

Within 120 days of the date of entry into force of the Energy Decree Law (ie 22 March 2026), each region and autonomous province has to identify, by means of its own law, the areas suitable for installing additional RES plants in addition to the areas suitable ex lege referred to in paragraph b. above, in accordance with the principles and criteria established by Article 11-bis, paragraph 4 of the TU FER and the objectives referred to in paragraph 5.

To identify additional areas suitable for installing renewable energy plants, the regions and provinces have to take into account the following principles and criteria:

protect cultural heritage and landscape, air and water quality, agricultural areas, with particular regard to those of high value and forest areas;

safeguard the specific characteristics of areas included in the Natura 2000 network and protected natural areas, wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, and UNESCO site protection areas, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11-quinquies of the TU FER;

the classification of an area as suitable may depend on the type of renewable energy plant or the power of a given plant;

it’s impossible to envisage general and abstract prohibitions on the installation of renewable energy plants;

priority qualification as suitable areas for surfaces and structures that are built on or characterised by soil sealing, also with a view to promoting individual and collective self-consumption;

for the purposes of classifying an agricultural area as suitable, the presence of productive activities and farms established in the area is relevant;

to preserve the agricultural use of land, agricultural areas that can be classified as suitable at regional level must not be less than 0.8% of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) nor more than 3% of the UAA itself; without prejudice to this percentage ratio, specific percentages of UAA exploitation may be defined at municipal level;

give priority to areas characterised by the presence of industrial centres, also with a view to facilitating self-consumption and decarbonisation of the productive sectors;

give priority to areas experiencing complex industrial crisis, also with a view to promoting industrial conversion and safeguarding employment levels;

to balance the needs of environmental protection with those of cultural and landscape heritage protection, the regions may not classify as suitable areas included within the perimeter of assets subject to protection pursuant to Legislative Decree 42/2004 or those included in a 3 km buffer zone, in the case of wind farms, and 500 m, in the case of photovoltaic plants, from the perimeter of the protected assets themselves, nor identify as suitable areas where the characteristics of the plants to be built are in conflict with the implementation rules provided for in the landscape plans.

On the basis of the above, we observe that:

as recently stated by the Regional Administrative Court of Rome, areas deemed suitable by law constitute a fundamental and essential core for the installation of RES plants, given that the regions and autonomous provinces can only identify additional areas suitable for RES plants beyond those already provided for in Article 11-bis, paragraph 1 of the Consolidated Law on Renewable Energy Sources (TU FER);

the regions and autonomous provinces can only identify additional areas “suitable” for the installation of RES plants by regional law and not “unsuitable” areas;

in identifying “suitable” areas, the regions and autonomous provinces can’t impose generalised bans on the construction of plants, as happened in the well-known case of the region of Sardinia through Regional Law 20/2024;

given the new definition of the principles and criteria for identifying additional areas suitable for the installation of FER plants, pursuant to the parameter set out in Article 10 of Law No. 62/1953, previous regional laws that conflict with this new principle established by the state may be considered implicitly repealed.

This measure reduces the scope for conflict between the state and the regions, because no derogations may be introduced for areas identified as suitable at national level. And because introducing general and abstract prohibitions, and therefore moratoria, is prohibited, and consistency with decarbonisation objectives has been imposed.

h. Power of the state to take action and replace the regions/provinces in the event of inaction

The Department for Regional Affairs and Autonomies of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers also exercises driving functions for the purposes of exercising substitute power.

In the event of failure to adopt this law within the deadline, or failure to comply with the principles and criteria referred to in paragraph 4 or the objectives referred to in paragraph 5, Article 41 of Law No. 234 of 24 December 2012 will apply. This provides for the adoption of substitute state measures for non-compliant regions and provinces, with effect from the expiry of the deadline set for the implementation of the relevant EU legislation, and which will in any case cease to have effect from the date of entry into force of the implementing measures of each region and autonomous province.

The state measures explicitly indicate the substitute nature of the power exercised and the flexible nature of the provisions. The legislative acts have to be submitted for prior examination to the Permanent Conference for Relations between the state, the regions and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano. The autonomous provinces are responsible for the planning process to identify suitable areas in accordance with the Special Statute and the relevant implementing regulations.

i. Provisions on authorisation regimes for plants in suitable areas

The Energy Decree Law introduces into Legislative Decree 190/2024 the new Article 11-quater on “Regulation of simplified administrative regimes for plants in suitable areas.” In particular:

the implementation of the measures referred to in Annexes A and B of the TU FER (ie works subject to the free building regime and the simplified authorisation procedure) in suitable areas is not subject to the acquisition of authorisation from the competent landscape authority, which issues a mandatory and non-binding opinion within the same time limits as those provided for the issue of the relevant acts of consent pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 of the TU FER;

within the scope of the single authorisation procedures relating to the works referred to in Annex C of the TU FER (ie works subject to single authorisation) located in suitable areas, the landscape authority will issue a mandatory and non-binding opinion for environmental impact assessments and, if the deadline for issuing its opinion has passed without response, the proceeding authority will decide on the single authorisation application;

the terms of the single authorisation procedure for the construction and operation of the plants referred to in Annex C of the TU FER falling within suitable areas are reduced by one third, rounded down to the nearest whole number, where necessary;

the provisions referred to in the previous points also apply in the case of development or upgrading of the national transmission network.

The provision follows the previous provision of Article 22 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 but with the following change: the provisions referred to in the previous points apply only if the RES plant is located entirely in areas classified as suitable. This assessment seems to exclude the development and upgrading of the national transmission network, which could therefore be located in unsuitable areas and enjoy the benefits of the suitable areas of the plant. However, no mention is made of user-side connection works, which must also be located in a suitable area for the assessment.

If the plant is not located, or is only partially located, in a suitable area, the above provisions don’t apply. The criterion of unsuitability of the area prevails.

j. Decarbonisation targets and agreement between regions

Article 2, paragraph 1, letter p) of the Energy Decree Law confirms the decarbonisation obligations of the regions in accordance with the provisions of the Ministerial Decree of 21 June 2024.

Annex C-bis has been added to the TU FER, which contains the same table as the Ministerial Decree of 21 June 2024 and confirms the same regional allocations of the minimum annual power to be installed, for a total of 80 GW between 2021 and 2030.

The regions must significantly speed up their administrative procedures if they want to meet the 2030 targets, although it’s envisaged that each region may enter into agreements with other regions for the statistical transfer of certain amounts of power from renewable sources. A decree issued by the competent Director-General of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security defines the standard agreement for statistical transfer, and the methods for calculating the quantities of power involved in the transfer.

In the case of renewable energy plants located in the territory of several regions or autonomous provinces, or whose production is attributable to contributions from several regions or autonomous provinces, the allocation of the respective power for achieving the objectives is defined by agreements entered into between each local authority concerned.

k. The Digital Platform for Suitable Areas and Acceleration Zones

The Energy Decree also introduces the new Article 12-bis into the TU FER. Within 60 days of the Energy Decree entering into force (ie by 21 January 2026) the operating procedures of the platform established by MASE Decree of 17 September 2024 have to be regulated to include all information and tools necessary to connect and process data for the characterisation and qualification of the territory, the estimation of the potential and the classification of surfaces, areas and zones. This is to ensure adequate support to the regions and autonomous provinces in the process of identifying suitable areas and acceleration zones and in related monitoring activities. This is by Decree of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (the MASE) and subject to agreement at the Unified Conference referred to in Article 8 of Legislative Decree 281/1997.

This platform also contains a counter of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) intended for the installation of RES plants, fed by information and data provided by the regions and autonomous provinces regarding the areas classified as agricultural in their respective territories.

l. Repeal of provisions

Articles 18, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 are repealed.

11.Within the scope of the investments referred to in Article 4, paragraph 1, investments in the following are eligible for subsidies:

a)new tangible assets, instrumental to the business referred to in Annex A to Law No. 232 of 11 December 2016, interconnected with the company’s production management system or supply network and characterised by the additional requirements set out in the aforementioned annex;

b) new intangible assets, instrumental to the business referred to in Annex B to Law No. 232 of 11 December 20, including business management software if purchased as part of the same innovation project that includes investments in systems, platforms or applications for plant intelligence that ensure continuous monitoring and visualisation of energy consumption and self-produced and self-consumed energy, or introduce energy efficiency mechanisms through the collection and processing of data also from field IoT sensors (Energy Dashboarding).

2. For the purposes of identifying eligible investments, the provisions of Article 1, paragraph 1053, of Law No. 178 of 30 December 2020 shall apply, with particular reference to the ineligibility of investments:

a) in the assets indicated in Article 164, paragraph 1, of the TUIR;

b) in assets for which the decree of the Minister of Finance of 31 December 1988, published in the ordinary supplement to the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic No. 27 of 2 February 1989, containing the table of depreciation coefficients for tax purposes, establishes rates lower than 6.5 per cent;

c) buildings and constructions;

d) assets referred to in Annex 3 attached to Law No. 208 of 28 December 2015

2The latter, referred to in Article 20, paragraph 1 bis of Legislative Decree 199/2021, are exempt from the prohibition on the installation of ground-mounted photovoltaic systems on agricultural land.

O’Brien is the executive director of the Energy Forward Alliance, a clean energy nonprofit subsidiary of the Tri-City Development Council (TRIDEC).","Artificial intelligence is reshaping the world’s scientific, industrial and energy landscapes – and the Tri-Cities is right at the center of this transformation. While much of Washington state is still debating the role of data centers needed to support this sea change, the Tri-Cities has taken a different path.

Communities across our area are already showing how – with the right partnerships and strategic intention – technological collaboration and data center deployment can be enablers of our state’s clean energy goals, scientific innovation and leadership, job growth, and industrial and economic development.

In a region that has powered the Pacific Northwest for 80 years, we understand that the question is not whether data centers are good or bad. The real question is whether we will utilize them as tools to build a prosperous future – or push away these opportunities that other states will happily capture.

Strategic partnerships

Across the Tri-Cities, local communities are demonstrating what a thoughtful, intentional approach to data centers can look like.

Deploying advanced nuclear clean energy has been a top priority for the Tri-Cities for years, but moving from aspiration to deployment requires partners with scale, capital and long-term load. That is exactly what Energy Northwest found through its collaboration with Amazon and X-energy on the Cascade Advanced Energy Facility.

Amazon’s prospective data center provides the anchor demand that makes it possible to deploy the Xe-100 here, advancing public power, modernizing the grid and reinforcing our community’s leadership in clean energy. This is not data center growth for its own sake; the data center partnership is what enables public-sector energy priorities to align with private-sector investment.

The Atlas Agro Pacific Green Fertilizer facility in Richland is another illustration of how data centers can be leveraged to unlock major industrial and clean energy opportunities. For Atlas, the biggest challenge has not been building a first-of-its-kind, carbon-free fertilizer manufacturing facility; rather, it has been building the transmission line to power the facility that has served as the long pole in the tent.

By pursuing a co-location partnership with a technology company that can provide upfront capital to build the line, Atlas Agro and the city of Richland can advance job growth, a strengthened agriculture sector, onshored domestic fertilizer production, and climate leadership via both the fertilizer plant and a data center campus.

Meanwhile, the city of West Richland is considering opportunities to integrate data centers into new municipal and district energy systems as the Lewis & Clark Ranch development moves forward.

And the Port of Pasco is pursuing how its work on agricultural symbiosis – a circular model where industrial byproducts become inputs for other industries – could be strengthened through data center partnerships that provide infrastructure, heat and energy services needed to scale the model.

Collectively, these examples reinforce how our region is proactively aligning technology infrastructure with local, community-centered goals.

Federal partnerships at Hanford

Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued a national Request for Information on potential AI infrastructure sites. The Energy Forward Alliance led our community’s response, articulating a unified regional vision of integrating data centers with new transmission, clean energy generation, advanced manufacturing, and research assets across industrially-zoned portions of underutilized Hanford Site lands.

DOE is now actively engaging with our region to explore how Hanford can support national security, scientific and AI missions paired with local economic development. This is the Tri-Cities at our best: leading, not waiting; partnering, not prohibiting.

Tri-Cities leads nation

PNNL’s growing role in artificial intelligence further underscores the importance of data center infrastructure in our region. The Genesis Mission, launched by DOE, is a national effort to harness AI to accelerate scientific discovery and energy innovation. From grid optimization and climate modeling to advanced materials and national security, these breakthroughs require immense computing power and reliable, scalable infrastructure.

Data centers are not incidental to these missions, they are foundational. If Washington wants to continue serving as home to PNNL’s world-class scientific leadership and attract the next generation of federal investment, we must be a state that welcomes – not discourages – the infrastructure that enables it.

State’s tech legacy

The recent recommendations issued by Gov. Ferguson’s Data Center Workgroup have raised concerns for communities across Washington. While the report acknowledges benefits of data centers, several provisions – if implemented – would significantly disincentivize future investment. In effect, they send a message to hyperscalers and technology companies that Washington is skeptical at best – and hostile at worst – to their presence.

For a state with such a strong legacy of technological innovation – the state of Amazon and Expedia, Microsoft and F5, Zillow and T-Mobile – this does not reflect a forward-looking future built on prosperity and innovation. Nor does it reflect the real work being done in places like the Tri-Cities, where local governments, energy producers, researchers and industry partners are already showing how data centers can strengthen clean energy deployment, job creation and industrial development.

Labor is right

Washington’s workers see this clearly. Organizations like Climate Jobs Washington and the Washington State Building and Construction Trades Council have been unequivocal in sounding the alarm about the state’s direction and the recommendations from the Work Group: “…by blocking these projects, opponents are choking out one of the only consistent sources of family-wage union construction jobs.”

Sweeping anti-data center policies threaten jobs, delay clean energy deployment, undermine investment in our state’s communities, and cede economic opportunity to other states. These labor organizations know that major clean energy and technology projects don’t get built by accident – they get built through partnership. And unless we welcome the partners who can help build them, other states will.

Better path forward

No one is calling for data centers to blanket our state. Local communities are seeking to work with partners strategically and intentionally to align data center investments with our goals for energy generation deployment, industrial and manufacturing job growth, and other economic development.

In the Tri-Cities, that work is already underway. We are demonstrating how to plan with intention, partner with purpose, and use data centers as an asset – not an obstacle – to building the prosperous future we want. If Washington wants to lead in clean energy, in AI, and in innovation, then we must embrace the partnerships that make that leadership possible.

According to Business Insider, large tech companies filed permits for 54 new data centers in the commonwealth in 2025.

As energy needs associated with data centers continue to climb, so do questions about their reliability, sustainability, and economic impacts.

Virginia Tech recently hosted a workshop bringing together experts from industry, academia, and government to plan for a center-scale effort with the goal of enabling a more resilient and efficient data center ecosystem through research, workforce development, and policy. The meeting stemmed from research by an interdisciplinary team, with support from the College of Engineering’s Major Grants Initiative. Ali Mehrizi-Sani, professor of electrical engineering and director of the Power and Energy Center at Virginia Tech, and principal investigator for the research project, shared insights from the workshop and his research on power, policy, and cybersecurity issues that will shape the future of data centers in the commonwealth and beyond.

What was the goal of the recent data center workshop?

This workshop was really about bringing all the right voices together to understand what we need — scientifically, technically, and from a policy standpoint — to make Virginia’s data center ecosystem more sustainable and resilient. We wanted to identify the capability gaps we have today, the R&D questions we should be tackling, and the issues that matter most to industry and our citizens.

We framed it around a simple question for the stakeholders: What tools do you wish you had right now that would make your work easier?

Who participated in the discussion?

The workshop brought together a deliberately diverse, hand-selected group of about 35 participants representing academia, industry, utilities, environmental organizations, and state policymakers.

We had researchers from Virginia Tech, University of Virginia, Clemson, University of Alaska, and New York University, along with representatives from Dominion Energy, Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative, and Rappahannock Electric Cooperative.

The group also included representatives from the Piedmont Environmental Council, who voiced environmental and community perspectives, and state commissions such as the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation and the Joint Commission on Technology and Science, which advises the Virginia General Assembly.

What are the biggest misconceptions about data centers?

People often discuss the environmental impacts associated with data centers, but they often don’t talk about the large amounts of electric power they need. Most assume that power will always be there, but that takes a lot of generation and transmission infrastructure and many engineers. It’s the curse of a reliable system — it becomes invisible.

One of the most common misconceptions is the assumption that the existing power system can easily accommodate new and expanding data centers. While data centers have become vital for cloud computing, AI, and digital communication, their energy footprint is immense and continues to grow.

How does public perception influence data center construction?

Public perception plays a powerful role in shaping how data centers are built and managed. Many Virginians see the visible effects of large facilities, from changes in landscape, to local traffic, to construction, to worry about rising electricity costs or water consumption. Those perceptions are not unfounded, but they need to be considered alongside the factual impact that data centers bring to the commonwealth.

Each facility typically employs around 50 people, and those positions tend to be high-paying technical and maintenance roles, supported by hundreds of additional jobs during construction and through related service contracts. Counties that host data centers often see substantial boosts in local tax revenue, which can fund schools, infrastructure, and public services.

Looking ahead, what do you see as the next big opportunities for innovation?

Our research team is developing better tools to coordinate data centers with the grid. These optimization models can improve reliability and planning. They could also apply to renewables and other large-scale energy systems. And we’re keeping a close eye on new technologies like small modular reactors and next-generation batteries. We need a real breakthrough in both to make them mainstream.

The future of data centers and the power systems that sustain them depends on multifaceted innovation, where engineering, policy, and economics intersect. Our work is about creating tools and partnerships that help make those decisions intelligently. That’s how we ensure that the grid, and the technology it supports, remain strong for decades to come.",https://news.vt.edu/content/news_vt_edu/en/articles/2025/12/eng-coe-ece-powering-the-future-data-centers-ali-mehrizi-sani/_jcr_content/image.transform/l-medium/image.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:02:52.938684

Dive Brief:

Virginia ranks first, and Alabama last, in a Southeast power sector “competitiveness” dashboard launched this week by Duke University researchers.

Twelve states were scored according to indicators such as participation in wholesale power markets, net metering policies, presence of a consumer advocate, interconnection standards, procurement requirements and third-party power purchase agreements.

The top three ranked states – Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky – all participate in a regional transmission organization or an independent system operator like the PJM Interconnection or the Midcontitent Independent System Operator, researchers noted in a call with reporters and others on Thursday. However, the Southeast lacks its own ISO or RTO, posing a barrier to participation for the more southern states.

Dive Insight:

Trey Gowdy, research lead on energy and climate policy at Duke’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability, said on the call that there was “a lot of nuance” in their results, but that the findings generally grouped the 12 states into five tiers of descending competitiveness.

The first tier, which is the most competitive, Gowdy said, includes Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky, while the second tier contains Arkansas and Louisiana, the third contains Mississippi, North Carolina, Florida and South Carolina, the fourth contains Georgia and Tennessee, and the fifth contains Alabama alone.

“We kind of present those as kind of batches and possibly peer states,” he said.

Virginia ranked highest when it came to factors such as having an approved utility green tariff program, a state consumer office advocate, a requirement for limited competitive procurement for renewables and wholesale market participation.

Virginia ranked lower in variables like generation concentration and customer concentration, indicating relatively few service providers per capita.

The state’s electric utility sector, “including distribution utilities, is highly concentrated,” the dashboard says. “The state has a customer concentration (HHI) score of 4,475, which exceeds the 1,800 threshold that signals a highly concentrated market. This indicates that a small number of utilities serve customers across the state.”

The HHI, or Herfindahl-Hirschman index, “is a concept that comes from antitrust legislation” and is used by the Department of Justice to screen mergers and acquisitions, said Eric Parajon, a policy analyst for the Nicholas Institute, during the call.

He said they measured generation concentration by dividing each utility’s total nameplate capacity in a state by that state’s total nameplace capacity across generation units.

Virginia’s score “indicates a highly concentrated market,” he said. Nearly all of Virginia is covered by Dominion Energy, a monopoly utility. The state’s generation concentration was 3,540, again exceeding a 1,800 threshold set by the researchers.

Alabama, which ranked last, received positive scores for permitting municipal ownership of utilities and having a state consumer advocate office. It received negative scores for factors including its lack of statewide interconnection standards, wholesale market participation, a formal requirement for competitive solicitations and any net metering policy.

However, its HHI score for customer concentration was 3,210 and for generation concentration was 2,686 – both lower than Virginia’s respective scores.

A state’s participation in a regional transmission organization or independent system operator like PJM is “certainly a fairly significant element of competitiveness and kind of competition writ large,” and “something that we’re really focused on evaluating,” said Parajon.

Jackson Ewing, director of energy and climate policy at the Nicholas Institute, said that the rankings don’t reflect that “states that scored quite high on competitiveness metrics in aggregate scored quite low in certain indicators,” and vice versa.

“I think the heterogeneity of the results that we’ve realized here really embodies the variance that we see across the Southeast on these issues,” Ewing said.

In the future, the team that produced the dashboard is interested in measuring factors like “interconnection queue dynamics and policies,” Ewing said, or going further “into measuring levels of public support and opposition for new build, generation, transmission, distribution. We could get into permitting lag times and processes. All those are kind of outside our scope now, but are things that we’re actively considering.”

Alix Zwane, the director of research and engagement strategy at the Nicholas Institute, said another “natural next step” is to examine “the relationship between competitiveness and these other ultimate outcomes of interest — whether it’s consumer welfare or wellbeing or environmental outcomes.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/nSSb2mX-b_TcZrFo234vB_X6Jnajdx3wt06w539wyXM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05MDY2MTk0MS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-12 13:02:20.345127

“Residents in Northeast Ohio deserve fair, data-driven policies,” Roemer said.","The EPA has rejected a request from Ohio lawmakers to end the E-Check vehicle emissions testing program in seven Northeast Ohio counties.

State officials had proposed replacing the physical inspection with a form where motorists attest their vehicle's emissions system is working properly.

The E-Check program has been required since 1996 in Summit, Portage, Medina, Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain and Geauga counties to reduce air pollution.

State Rep. Bill Roemer, who championed the change, expressed disappointment and plans to appeal to federal officials.

Greater Akron's E-Check program is not going away anytime soon.

The request by Ohio lawmakers to scuttle the requirement that motorists in Greater Akron and Cleveland have their vehicles inspected every two years has been rejected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regional office in Chicago.

The request was part of a Transportation Bill passed by lawmakers earlier this year that asked the federal EPA and the Trump administration to make modifications to the state's emissions testing in northern Ohio.

Since 1996, motorists in Summit, Portage, Medina, Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain and Geauga counties have been mandated to have their vehicles tested to help meet the EPA's edict that the state cut down on lower-level ozone or pollution.

State Rep. Bill Roemer, a Republican from Richfield, said he is disappointed by the decision handed down by regulators this week.

Roemer championed the proposal that would have allowed residents in seven Northeast Ohio counties to submit an attestation form in place of a physical E-Check inspection.

“This decision is a setback for hardworking Ohio families,” Roemer said in a statement. “The attestation option offered a practical, safe alternative that would save people both time and money. Instead, (the EPA) chose to maintain an outdated process that, frankly, continues to burden families with unnecessary requirements.”

The formal request − 964 pages long − was sent to U.S. EPA's regional office in Chicago on July 9.

Roemer argues that the air is actually cleaner in parts of northern Ohio where the testing is mandated than other areas of the state.

“For too many years, the seven counties in Northeast Ohio have been unfairly burdened by a program that simply does not match the data,” Roemer said. “The E-Check program was created to safeguard public health, and the attestation option was a commonsense update that balanced safety, modernization, and convenience. By rejecting it, (the EPA) is prioritizing bureaucracy over practical solutions without delivering any measurable air-quality benefits.”

Roemer said he plans to call on federal officials and President Donald Trump to reconsider Ohio's request to modify the testing.

“Residents in Northeast Ohio deserve fair, data-driven policies,” Roemer said. “I urge (the EPA administrator) and President Trump to intervene, correct this decision, and allow the E-Check Ease Act to move forward for the benefit of families across our region.”

What changes were proposed for E-Check?

As it stands now, all gas-, diesel- and flex-fueled vehicles (including non-plug-in hybrids) that are between six and 25 years old and registered in Summit, Portage, Medina, Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain and Geauga counties are required to be tested by E-Check every two years.

The testing is done at an E-Check station or a mobile kiosk.

If the vehicle's check engine light is on, it is an automatic failure of the test, requiring repairs that must total at least $300 for a waiver.

The proposed modifications would forgo the in-person testing and simply require motorists to ""attest"" that a vehicle's emission system − including muffler and catalytic converter − are working and have not been tampered with.","https://www.beaconjournal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/23/NABJ/83821562007-img-an-e-check-inspector-1-1-lp-13-hdnq-4-l-2016070874.JPG?crop=1999,1125,x0,y0&width=1999&height=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-12 13:01:39.535293

Plug & Charge, based on the ISO 15118-20 communication standard, simplifies charging for EV drivers.
“ChargePoint anticipates that PnC will gain traction, fueling further expansion of EV charging infrastructure, in 2026,” says the company.
Plug & Charge technology already operates on ChargePoint’s network and via roaming partners in North America and Europe.
Car manufacturers (OEMs) must enable their vehicles for Plug & Charge, and prepare their backend software for certificate management by a certification authority.","EVSE supplier and charging network operator ChargePoint has announced that its entire current hardware portfolio now supports Plug & Charge technology.

Plug & Charge, based on the ISO 15118-20 communication standard, simplifies charging for EV drivers. Instead of navigating proprietary apps or dealing with credit card readers (both common points of failure), drivers simply plug in and go about their business. Authentication and secure billing are handled automatically.

“ChargePoint anticipates that PnC will gain traction, fueling further expansion of EV charging infrastructure, in 2026,” says the company. “It will be particularly useful for the fleet sector and car-sharing businesses.”

Starting January 1, 2027, support for ISO 15118-20 will be mandatory in the EU.

Plug & Charge technology already operates on ChargePoint’s network and via roaming partners in North America and Europe. However, the company points out that scaling it up to encourage widespread adoption will require overcoming complex technical, commercial and regulatory hurdles. (There is also a semantic hurdle. Here at Charged, we say “Plug & Charge,” but some say “Plug and Charge,” and ChargePoint appears to have coined “PnC.”)

Daniel Brown, Senior Director, Product Management at ChargePoint, said: “The consumer demand for Plug & Charge is clear, but scaling access to drivers is a complex exercise in global alignment across hundreds of market players in four key areas.”

To wit:

Charge Point Operators (CPOs) need to source hardware and backend software that is Plug & Charge-compatible.

E-mobility service providers, which manage user-facing data and process payments, need to align their offerings with backend providers that manage chargers.

Car manufacturers (OEMs) must enable their vehicles for Plug & Charge, and prepare their backend software for certificate management by a certification authority.

Certificate authorities oversee the authentication and all necessary security to ensure a seamless, reliable and trustworthy process for the end user.

The very real challenges of scaling Plug & Charge seem to be the reason that ChargePoint competitor EVgo prefers Autocharge (an alternative seamless charging system based on DIN Spec 70121) for the moment. “We are committed to rolling out the Plug & Charge standard once the intricacies around certification and implementation have been addressed, [but] in the meantime, we continue to support Autocharge+ as our current solution to offer seamless session initiation,” an EVgo spokesperson told Charged.

“As awareness of the benefits of Plug & Charge continues to grow and key players collaborate to remove barriers, we anticipate new levels of alignment and significant momentum in 2026,” added ChargePoint’s Daniel Brown. “With ChargePoint’s global scale and expertise driving this innovation, we are positioned as a key enabler of a competitive, interoperable and secure EV charging ecosystem.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CP-stations-with-NACS_759x398.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 13:01:48.601645

The water flowing through Neptune Pass is now delivering enough sediment to create sandbars in Breton Sound – helping to restore the shoreline.
What began as a small outlet at Neptune Pass has now grown to become an 850-foot-wide channel.
Part of the Green River system, Sage Creek in Southwest Wyoming is a critical water source for local communities and native fish.","Across the country, communities are discovering that some of the most effective solutions to today’s environmental challenges come from working with nature rather than against it. From the shifting deltas of coastal Louisiana to the high-desert streams of Wyoming, restoration efforts show that when we support natural processes—rather than replace or restrain them—we can rebuild vital landscapes, strengthen community resilience and create long-term environmental and economic benefits. Two recent examples from Neptune Pass, in Louisiana, and Sage Creek, in Wyoming, illustrate how following nature’s lead can spark transformative, lasting change.

As the Mississippi River flows through Louisiana and towards the Gulf of Mexico, the mud, clay, sand and silt the water carries with it is deposited into coastal wetlands. This process helps balance coastal erosion by creating new land along the shore. But increasingly frequent, climate change-driven mega-storms, along with human-made infrastructure that disrupts the river’s natural flow, have diminished its ability to build new land. As a result, a football field's worth of the Louisiana coast now disappears into the sea every 100 minutes.

Over the last century Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of land. That is roughly the same size as the state of Delaware. The remaining land weakened by erosion is more vulnerable to damage from hurricanes and storm surges.

But at Neptune Pass, a small outlet forged by the Mississippi River 70 miles south of New Orleans, nature is showing us a path to bring back eroded coastal areas and create more resilient landscapes.

After several high-water years culminating in 2019, the Mississippi River broke free of the constraints channeling it at Neptune Pass. The water flowing through Neptune Pass is now delivering enough sediment to create sandbars in Breton Sound – helping to restore the shoreline.

Replenished coastal wetlands slow storm surge and absorb floodwaters, protecting both people and property from catastrophic damage. As sediment is deposited, vegetation takes root, which also creates habitat for fish, migrating birds and other wildlife.

What began as a small outlet at Neptune Pass has now grown to become an 850-foot-wide channel. If it were categorized as a stand-alone river, it would be the 10th largest river by volume of flowing water in North America.

In past years the Army Corps of Engineers may have responded to nature breaking free in this way by closing the pass entirely as the simplest way to protect the larger river from disruption. Instead, working in consultation with environmental groups, the Corps has recommended stabilizing the pass to keep it from expanding further, while still allowing water and sediment to flow through.

By choosing to follow nature’s lead, rather than trying to force it to fit a predetermined, human-engineered project, we have built a more sustainable, long-term strategy to protect Louisiana’s Gulf Coast.

More than 1,500 miles away in an entirely different landscape, nature is creating lasting change in the Colorado River Basin. In this case, conservationists are using human-made infrastructure to kickstart a solution that will allow nature to take over and protect local communities and wildlife habitats.

Part of the Green River system, Sage Creek in Southwest Wyoming is a critical water source for local communities and native fish. The river’s importance stretches far beyond the local region. It feeds into the Green River and ultimately into Flaming Gorge reservoir, which supplies water to Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Colorado.

Over the years, conditions along Sage Creek have deteriorated due to fire, flooding, prolonged drought and other land use issues. In an effort to improve the health of the river, Trout Unlimited is working with local landowners to find ways to restore the natural environment around Sage Creek.

Their work has included building dozens of beaver starter homes, also called Beaver Dam Analogs. Designed to mimic the dams that beavers naturally build in their habitat, these structures are porous walls of sticks, logs and leaves that slow water in one part of the stream, encouraging vegetation growth and creating wetlands. This slower-flowing water naturally filters sediment and pollutants as it runs downstream, leading to cleaner water supplies and healthier landscapes.

The wetter areas established by the dams also help protect against damage from catastrophic wildfires by generating natural firebreaks and absorbing floodwaters before they reach local communities.

Beaver dam analogs are, by nature, temporary. They’re meant to serve a purpose for a time and provide an opportunity for nature to take over and continue the natural process that has been started. If there are beaver colonies close by, the hope is that they treat the analog structures as starter homes by moving in, improving the original dams and building more structures in the area. The more dams that are built, the more their habitat improves by enabling conditions for the willow and cottonwood trees beavers depend on to survive.

The work on Sage Creek has delivered results. Beaver colonies have moved in and, as a result, the stream bed has risen several feet in some areas. This has improved wildlife habitat and helps ensure reliable, clean and safe water supplies for communities. It also benefits farmers and ranchers by increasing vegetation for grazing and improving the reliability of irrigation supplies.",https://dims.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/dims4/default/a76522b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3854x2023+0+434/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.waltonfamilyfoundation.org%2F39%2Fc7%2F9b1129304667aaaff3f0bf567407%2Fneptune-pass-photo-3-1-edited.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 13:02:25.295342

Samsung SDI scores LFP deal as it switches from EV battery production

Samsung SDI, the battery arm of the Samsung Electronics conglomerate, said its US-based subsidiary had signed a three-year deal from 2026 to supply LFP energy storage batteries to an unnamed “American customer”, in a deal that exceeds $1.36 billion.

The LFP cells supplied by Samsung SDI will be installed in Samsung’s battery energy storage system (BESS) it calls SBB 2.0, a 20-foot containerized energy storage system. SBB 2.0 is Samsung SDI’s first energy storage system to use prismatic LFP batteries, with the previous SBB 1.7 equipped with high-nickel NCA cells.

The cells will come from modified production lines at Samsung SDI’s existing factory, originally built in partnership with Stallantis for the US EV market. As market demand for EVs has grown at slower-than-expected rates, Samsung has already converted lines to produce energy storage batteries.

A similar announcement for a Stellantis manufacturing facility in North America came in previous months, as NextStar’s Canadian battery plant shifted gears to produce stationary storage batteries as opposed to lines solely dedicated to EV cells.

It’s used in many industries, including the production of petrochemicals, cement, and fertilizers.

MIT chemical engineers have now discovered a simple way to make carbon capture more efficient and affordable, by adding a common chemical compound to capture solutions. The innovation could cut costs significantly and enable the technology to run on waste heat or even sunlight, instead of energy-intensive heating.

Their new approach uses a chemical called tris — short for tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane — to stabilize the pH of the solution used to capture CO2, allowing the system to absorb more of the gas at relatively low temperature. The system can release CO2 at just 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit) — a dramatic improvement over conventional methods, which require temperatures exceeding 120 C to release captured carbon.

“It’s something that could be implemented almost immediately in fairly standard types of equipment,” says T. Alan Hatton, the Ralph Landau Professor of Chemical Engineering Practice at MIT and the senior author of the study.

Youhong (Nancy) Guo, a recent MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor of applied physical sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in Nature Chemical Engineering.

More efficient capture

Using current technologies, around 0.1 percent of global carbon emissions is captured and either stored underground or converted into other products.

The most widely used carbon-capture method involves running waste gases through a solution that contains chemical compounds called amines. These solutions have a high pH, which allows them to absorb CO2, an acidic gas. In addition to traditional amines, basic compounds called carbonates, which are inexpensive and readily available, can also capture acidic CO2 gas. However, as CO2 is absorbed, the pH of the solution drops quickly, limiting the CO2 uptake capacity.

The most energy-intensive step comes once the CO2 is absorbed, because both amine and carbonate solutions must be heated to above 120 C to release the captured carbon. This regeneration step consumes enormous amounts of energy.

To make carbon capture by carbonates more efficient, the MIT team added tris into a potassium carbonate solution. This chemical, commonly used in lab experiments and found in some cosmetics and the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, acts as a pH buffer — a solution that helps prevent the pH from changing.

When added to a carbonate solution, positively charged tris balances the negative charge of the bicarbonate ions formed when CO2 is absorbed. This stabilizes the pH, allowing the solution to absorb triple the amount of CO2.

As another advantage, tris is highly sensitive to temperature changes. When the solution full of CO2 is heated just slightly, to about 60 C, tris quickly releases protons, causing the pH to drop and the captured CO2 to bubble out.

“At room temperature, the solution can absorb more CO2, and with mild heating it can release the CO2. There is an instant pH change when we heat up the solution a little bit,” Guo says.

A simple swap

To demonstrate their approach, the researchers built a continuous-flow reactor for carbon capture. First, gases containing CO2 are bubbled through a reservoir containing carbonate and tris, which absorbs the CO2. That solution then is pumped into a CO2 regeneration module, which is heated to about 60 C to release a pure stream of CO2.

Once the CO2 is released, the carbonate solution is cooled and returned to the reservoir for another round of CO2 absorption and regeneration.

Because the system can operate at relatively low temperatures, there is more flexibility in where the energy could come from, such as solar panels, electricity, or waste heat already generated by industrial plants.

Swapping in carbonate-tris solutions to replace conventional amines should be straightforward for industrial facilities, the researchers say. “One of the nice things about this is its simplicity, in terms of overall design. It’s a drop-in approach that allows you to readily change over from one kind of solution to another,” Hatton says.

When carbon is captured from industrial plants, some of it can be diverted into the manufacture of other useful products, but most of it will likely end up being stored in underground geological formations, Hatton says.

“You can only use a small fraction of the captured CO2 for producing chemicals before you saturate the market,” he says.

Guo is now exploring whether other additives could make the carbon capture process even more efficient by speeding up CO2 absorption rates.

In June, the documentary was tapped by Prime Video for streaming on its massive global platform, where it continues to be available free for Amazon Prime subscribers and for rent by the general public. And in August, it screened at the star-studded Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival in Massachusetts.

Shanté and Gerard said one of the most memorable sentiments they heard from Aggies as they produced the film was the level of care and nurturing that accompanies the university’s academic rigor – from faculty, from staff and from alumni. That sets North Carolina A&T’s student experience apart from the thousands of other universities across America.

“It’s very much like a family. Like a mother or an auntie or something like, ‘Okay, yeah, but you still have to get this work done,’ ” Shanté told WFDD-FM earlier this year. Added Gerard, “It's amazing to see that type of genuine love for an institution and the people that walk through those halls.”",https://www.ncat.edu/news/2025/12/emmy-slider.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 13:02:07.624116

Our biggest win was protecting the national EV charging network from Trump’s illegal freeze of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. Our lawsuit – along with national pressure and sharp communications – helped prompt the program’s restart by unlocking $2.7 billion for essential EV charging infrastructure nationwide along highways.

Senior Attorney Joe Halso put it best when he described what was at stake when Trump moved to abandon the NEVI program in Law360:

“It’s no surprise that Trump’s unlawful NEVI freeze served Big Oil, while communities are left to pay the price—with more pollution, higher energy costs, and fewer charging options. We’re glad for the opportunity to restore essential projects that communities have been waiting on and to keep the clean energy economy moving forward.”

Now, every state has submitted NEVI plans under new guidance and they all are moving ahead. This program restart—and the fact that the new guidance came without any anti-EV poison pills—is a direct result of the litigation brought by us, our case partners, and twenty states and DC.

Our lawyers continue to fight to protect NEVI from further attacks and to ensure long-delayed EV charging projects proceed expeditiously.

This year we also delivered a powerful response against the Trump EPA’s dangerous proposal to block the federal climate pollution standards for cars and trucks, which had been updated by the Biden administration in 2024. We participated in a wide range of actions to make our opposition known, such as organizing dozens of participants to testify at a 4-day EPA hearing; submitting thousands of public comments; co-leading a sign-on comment letter with over 100 partners; and hosting a press conference in Michigan. Advocates across the country collectively demanded that the EPA keep the current common-sense, life-saving standards in place. The Trump EPA is set to make a decision to roll back these standards any day now.

We’re so proud of the Sierra Club’s leadership on National Drive Electric Month. Sierra Club staff and volunteers hosted community events in September and October showcasing zero-emission cars, trucks, buses, and bikes. Showcasing EVs and sharing helpful resources on incentives was super valuable and timely given the changes to federal funding and tax credits this year.

In 2026, we will continue working to ensure all Americans have access to zero-emission, reliable, and convenient transportation options. Our playbook includes supporting clean transportation and saving families money by deploying zero-emission vehicles, building robust EV charging infrastructure, improving access to public transit, and investing in safe infrastructure for walking and biking.

With these gains, we can improve air quality, cut costs, and dismantle the status-quo fossil fuel agenda paid for by Trump and his polluter cronies. Our committed staff, volunteers, and members across the country are ready to organize and campaign to meet this vital moment – to defend what we’ve built and advance clean, affordable transportation for all.

Rivian Automotive impressed Wall Street on Thursday with its plans for artificial intelligence, automation and an internally developed silicon chip, but significant challenges involving demand and capital remain for the electric vehicle maker.

Despite Wall Street analysts expressing some optimism following Rivian's first ""Autonomy and AI Day,"" the company's stock fell 6.1% to close Thursday at $16.43 per share. But shares recovered during intraday trading Friday and were up more than 15%.

While the event didn't cause many analysts to change ratings or price targets, Needham raised its price target on Rivian by 64% to $23 per share. The firm did so on the tech announcements and potential for future licensing deals, as well as higher-than-consensus expectations on deliveries next year of the company's new midsize R2 SUV.

""RIVN signaled a shift from an [automaker] adopting autonomy to one leveraging AI to build end-to-end autonomy,"" Needham analyst Chris Pierce said in a Friday investor note.

The company's stock had ramped up heading into the AI Day, but many analysts believed the announcements from the event were already ""priced in."" Shares also fell as OpenAI made its own AI announcement Thursday, revealing its most advanced model yet.

""We attended Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day yesterday in Palo Alto and came away mostly impressed with the strategic direction outlined by management,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said Friday in an investor note. ""However, the stock's weakness seems warranted given the run-up since earnings and lack of a major AI partnership/deal announcement.""

Rivian's announcements included a proprietary chip, RAP1, designed for ""physical AI,"" namely autonomous driving; an evolved software architecture, or ""brains"" of the vehicle; a new AI assistant; and a roadmap for getting to ""personal L4,"" or fully self-driving personally owned vehicles.

The latter begins later this month with an update involving its hands-free driving system, followed by plans to continue to expand capabilities until vehicles reach full autonomy in the years ahead. Rivian did not disclose a timeframe for the full autonomy or potential robotaxi fleet autonomous vehicles.

Leading up to the event, Rivian shares were up more than 30% to $17.50. Despite those gains, shares remain well off the levels of the company's IPO of $78 per share in 2021.

Barclays analyst Dan Levy and others said while Rivian's technology announcements, including the surprise proprietary chip, were impressive, the company remains a ""show me"" story amid more challenging market conditions.

""With RIVN facing a tougher path to breakeven on core vehicle sales alone, we believe with enhanced AV/AI capabilities RIVN is further paving the path to additional software/service revenues, which would be margin accretive,"" Levy said Friday in an investor note. ""To be clear, there is certainly a 'show me' element for RIVN on its capabilities.""

Challenges include slumping EV demand following the end of up to $7,500 tax credits in September, lack of other support under the Trump administration and internal struggles at the company involving products and capital.

Several analysts noted the adoption of advanced driver assistance systems remains low across the industry, even at U.S. EV leader Tesla , and Rivian is continuing to play catch up to other companies that have offered such systems for years.

Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe and other executives argued that the company's vertical integration of in-house capabilities including software, AI, vehicle platforms and other technologies will allow the automaker to be more efficient, quicker and better than others.

""AI is enabling us to create technology and customer experiences at a rate that is completely different from what we've seen in the past,"" Scaringe said during the event.

Such arguments, as well as the automaker's prior $5.8 billion joint venture software deal with Volkswagen, have led Wall Street to price Rivian's software business higher than its core of producing and selling EVs, given market conditions.

A $12 price target for Rivian shares from Morgan Stanley, which recently downgraded the company to underweight, includes $7 for software and services and $5 for its core automotive business. Several analysts added that Rivian might be able to license or sell its newest technologies, including chips.

""RIVN is developing a suite of hardware and software offerings to remain competitive in an Auto 2.0 world. However, several risks remain around demand, potentially limiting data capture needed to reach higher levels of autonomy,"" Morgan Stanley's Andrew Percoco said in a Friday note.

Morgan Stanley raised concerns about autonomy adoption rates, lackluster EV demand ahead of Rivian's new ""R2"" vehicle next year and a prolonged path to profitability as reasoning for the rating confirmation.

Carlos Barria | Reuters

RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan agreed: ""The advancements enhance Rivian's product offering but do not address ongoing concerns around liquidity and R2/R3 profitability.""

Rivian continues to lose billions of dollars annually, despite significant cost reductions and gains in software revenue thanks to its deal with VW.

Rivian ended the third quarter with $7.7 billion in total liquidity, including nearly $7.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that Scaringe has said position the company ""really well"" for the R2 launch.

The R2 midsize SUV is crucial for Rivian — especially since it's a major market in the U.S. With expectations of a $45,000 starting price, it is anticipated to broaden Rivian's customer base and be a proof-point for the company's efforts regarding profitability and cost savings.

Rivian's current R1 pickup truck and SUV consumer models start at more than $70,000. It also builds electric delivery vans, largely for its biggest shareholder Amazon , that start around $80,000.

""Profitability pressure will likely intensify as Rivian rolls out its ~$45K R2 platform in the highly competitive mid-size SUV segment,"" Narayan said. ""While targeting a lower price point could increase market reach, the R1 platform's struggles with profitability despite being nearly double the price of the R2 raise.""

Shares of Rivian, with a $22.5 billion market cap, are rated hold with a $15.43 per share price target, according to average ratings and estimates compiled by FactSet.

We also collected thousands of signatures urging Congress to protect clean energy and preserve the Inflation Reduction Act.
We will continue to defend strong energy efficiency standards, support clean home upgrades, and fight misinformation that undermines consumer choice and public health.
The fight for consumer choice, healthy homes, and clean industrial practices isn’t over.
And Sierra Club’s Clean Heat campaign is ready to meet the moment.","Sierra Club’s Building Electrification Campaign has worked hard over the years to ensure that people are informed and supported to make choices in their homes that reduce their exposure to pollution and lower utility bills. Energy efficient electric upgrades—like high-performance heat pumps (that offer heating and cooling), efficient water heaters, better insulation, and induction stoves, to name a few—offer a great user experience, play a huge role in lowering energy bills, and reduce dangerous indoor and outdoor air pollution.

In 2025, we focused on local, regional and state efforts to build and grow momentum towards building decarbonization and holistic upgrades that make homes safer, healthier, and more affordable to power. We also fought hard to preserve all the ground we have gained at the state and federal levels.

Despite growing public support, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are putting plans into motion to roll back common-sense energy efficiency standards (that are legally required to be updated) and made deep cuts to funding for clean energy investments that directly benefit American households through lower utility bills, a struggle with which most Americans are currently grappling. Trump ensured a dismantling of the ground-breaking Inflation Reduction Act that would have created lots of good-paying jobs and helped more families achieve safer, cleaner homes.

Every step of the way, and at all levels of government, we stood up for safer, healthier homes for people of all income levels and better access to more affordable, cleaner appliances.

Two efforts are particularly emblematic of our work at the federal level this year:

As soon as the Trump Administration came into office, we knew the landmark Inflation Reduction Act was on the chopping block. We got started right away in educating people and Congress about the benefits the IRA had already unlocked and the future the legislation could help achieve for regular people, businesses, and American manufacturing.

We released a series of videos across our social media platforms highlighting those benefits. We also collected thousands of signatures urging Congress to protect clean energy and preserve the Inflation Reduction Act. The videos featured:

Gloria Daniels in South Carolina who cut her energy costs by upgrading to a heat pump and solar panels—made affordable through a grant from the Sustainability Institute and federal programs from the Inflation Reduction Act;

Chef Chris Galarza, who shared how restaurants can improve kitchen conditions, save money, and boost efficiency by switching to induction—without sacrificing temperature control; and

American company, Copper, that makes induction stoves. Companies like Copper support stronger job security, boost domestic manufacturing, and make products for healthier, more efficient kitchens, and would have been boosted with support from the IRA.

Our efforts to protect IRA consumer rebates for energy efficient appliances have thus far been successful, though that fight is not over. And while Republicans in Congress did end tax credits for home energy upgrades, in our efforts to preserve what we could, we also raised awareness about the harms of burning fossil fuels in homes and the benefits of energy efficiency and electrification for energy security and affordability.

We have worked to make sure that consumers know that the benefits of the IRA home energy tax credits are still accessible through the end of the year by updating our home energy guide and sharing reminders on social media.

The framework for accelerating the transition to cleaner, more efficient homes and buildings may no longer exist at the federal level, but the change is underway nonetheless. And we will continue to educate people and facilitate that transformation as best we can in the coming year to meet our goals of cleaner air and more affordable energy.

Another critical program, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, was under attack throughout the year. We worked hard to protect and preserve it, and we were successful.

LIHEAP is a program that helps low-income households afford the energy they need to keep their homes safe, powered, and habitable, especially during extreme heat and cold events. Early in the year, DOGE fired all the staff responsible for the LIHEAP program, and the president proposed zeroing out LIHEAP’s budget all-together in the administration’s draft budget.

In June, we flew volunteers and staff from eight states into DC to share powerful constituent stories about the importance of LIHEAP with more than 35 Congressional offices. Sierra Club also generated more than 10,000+ digital actions and supporters drafted more than 120 letters to the editor in support of the program. Our voices were heard. LIHEAP funding was preserved in the final budget resolution that passed Congress.

However, LIHEAP faced further threats during the government shutdown. Existing staff shortages were compounded by the closure, and LIHEAP funds were not reaching states at a critical time, just as weather was beginning to turn cold in many places. We brought attention to this problem in the press and on social media, and called on utilities to take action to protect people from power shutoffs. Now, as we reach the end of the year, all LIHEAP funds have been distributed to states to deliver to people who can not afford their energy bills.

We also found ways to make significant progress at the local and state level.

Twelve cities in California passed air conditioning to heat pump conversion building codes, accelerating the transition off of gas in homes and buildings.

The City of Ashland, Oregon passed a novel climate pollution fee on new construction, ensuring that any new homes built with fossil fuels had to pay their fair share of the social cost of carbon.

Just this month, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) issued a final written order on Clean Heat targets, directing Colorado's major investor-owned gas utilities to achieve 41% reductions in emissions by 2035, compared to 2015 levels. The PUC rejected proposals for weaker targets by state agencies and utilities, siding with the arguments of the Sierra Club and Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, which were supported by local governments, state legislators, dozens of organizations across Colorado, and more than 600 members of the public.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities published final orders in proceedings addressing utility requests to charge customers for the costs of replacing aging gas infrastructure (Gas System Enhancement Plans). The orders cited the Sierra Club’s testimony and briefing dozens of times and adopted nearly all our recommendations to disincentivize the continued expansion of the gas system and prioritize safety over utility profits.

In New York, the Atlantic Chapter generated the most public comments by far of any environmental organization on the State’s draft Energy Plan, the first plan released in a decade. Sierra Club supporters also commented in person at every hearing across the state, especially in western New York, where dozens of Sierrans effectively countered the major turnout of opposition fueled in part by the influence of the local gas utility, National Fuel, who also fracks in Pennsylvania, and who has been successfully keeping area Democrats from supporting key statewide gas transition legislation from getting passed. Another highlight was focused on legislation. The only major environmental bill passed by the legislature will end gas line allowances if the Governor signs it, and collectively Sierrans took 3,000 actions supporting the bill, in addition to having almost a hundred volunteers from across the State travel to lobby legislators in support of the bill on 3 different lobby day events.

In Illinois, our advocacy and organizing led to Illinois Commerce Commission staff recommending an industrial electrification pilot program that would support industrial heat pump and thermal battery demonstration projects -- crucial strategies industry can use to reduce pollution, improve public health, and boost clean domestic manufacturing and jobs. Commission staff also recommended two other pilot programs based in part on Sierra Club’s advocacy: one to support electrification of agricultural activities such as grain drying and dairy production, and another to advance thermal energy networks, a form of shared energy that can provide efficient and pollution-free heating and cooling to entire neighborhoods.

Our campaign also drove comments and submitted testimony to the Illinois EPA during the drafting process of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) to reach the standards set for safe air in the Clean Air Act. Our efforts led the state’s EPA to broaden the public input process and actively consider adopting boiler electrification as a path to reduce emissions and achieve attainment of air quality standards. Now that the state has been moved from moderate to serious nonattainment, our efforts to engage the public and give regulators tools to address harmful emissions effectively are becoming even more crucial.

Sierra Club is defending state and local building electrification efforts against industry attack in courts across the country.

This year, we secured preliminary victories in multiple cases and defended initial wins on appeal.

Sierra Club was part of a successful lawsuit against the unconstitutional ballot initiative 2066 in Washington, which would have rolled back electrification policies across the state and increased energy costs. A state court ruled in our favor and paused implementation of the initiative. That decision has been appealed.

Sierra Club intervened in defense of a California air district’s rule that prohibits air pollution from boilers and the federal trial court agreed with our arguments. In October, we filed a brief at the appellate court urging it to uphold the rule.

The federal trial court in Colorado partially granted a motion by Sierra Club to dismiss an industry challenge of building code standards that would phase out gas appliances.

A federal trial court in New York upheld the state’s All-Electric Buildings law, which requires most new buildings to be all-electric by 2028.

Sierra Club played a vital role in coalition efforts to develop and pass the challenged law, and submitted amicus briefs at both the trial court and on appeal detailing the public health benefits of building electrification.

As we move into next year, the challenges may grow—but so will our resolve. We will continue to defend strong energy efficiency standards, support clean home upgrades, and fight misinformation that undermines consumer choice and public health. And we will expand our work as a campaign beyond residential buildings and into industrial settings, fighting to clean up industrial boilers.

In 2026, the Building Electrification campaign will have a new name: Clean Heat. Same mission, but even broader goals.

Efforts by the Trump administration and the fossil fuel industry to roll back and block our efforts doesn’t just stall progress. These attacks risk limiting consumer choice, keeping families locked into outdated technologies, lead to more pollution in overburdened communities, and worsen the affordability crisis.

The fight for consumer choice, healthy homes, and clean industrial practices isn’t over. In fact, it’s just getting started. And Sierra Club’s Clean Heat campaign is ready to meet the moment.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-12/image-4.png.webp?itok=DiMjHxB6,N,,2025-12-12 12:01:00.796539

The aim is to fashion a leaner, more agile European operation capable of turning a profit while consumers inch hesitantly toward electrification. For Ford, which has in recent years restructured factories, trimmed portfolios and navigated volatile EV demand, Europe remains both an opportunity and a warning as it tests the technological mettle of global carmakers.

Renault's leadership transition reaffirmed its plans for continuity and international ambition with the appointment of François Provost as CEO and director in July.

“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” said Jim Farley, president and CEO of Ford Motor Company. “How we compete here – how we innovate, partner and invest – will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”

""This partnership shows the strength of our partnership know-how and competitiveness in Europe,"" added François Provost, CEO of Renault Group. ""In the long term, combining our strengths with Ford will make us more innovative and more responsive in a fast-changing European automotive market.

The new plan reasserts three organising principles. First, to strengthen Ford Pro’s commercial dominance. Second, to rebuild passenger car desirability with distinctive, multi-energy products arriving from 2028. And third, to recalibrate Ford’s manufacturing base to secure scale, cost efficiency and flexibility in a region where margins remain elusive.

For Ford, it represents an expansion of its model to offer new electric vehicles at lower capital investment, following a similar agreement that utilises Volkswagen’s MEB platform. For Renault, the deal is an important alliance separate from Nissan, whose traditional partnership has recently faced challenges. The new collaboration with Ford, alongside a separate partnership with Geely, underscores Renault’s shift toward building a robust, new network of strategic global alliances.

Collectively, the effort follows a well-established pattern. Ford’s alliances with Koç Holding and Volkswagen underpin its commercial vehicle leadership, and the new tie-up with Renault extends this logic into the passenger car domain.

Recasting the industrial footprint for multi-energy flexibility

The restructuring of Ford’s industrial base is unfolding through a mixture of modernisation and inter-company synergy. Ford Otosan, the joint venture with Koç Holding, is widely cited as one of the sector’s most effective collaborations. Its plants are supplied with electric drive units from Halewood in the UK, following a £380 million investment in the facility, equivalent to roughly $480 million today. Advanced engines continue to flow from Ford’s Dagenham plant, maintaining its strategic relevance. Volkswagen also remains a pivotal partner, with Ford’s EVs from their alliance produced at the Electric Vehicle Centre in Cologne. Meanwhile Ford’s Valencia plant is being positioned as a backbone for the next phase of passenger car development, supporting the shift toward multi-energy architectures. Collectively, these arrangements represent Ford’s attempt to offset Europe’s structurally high costs while preserving control over product character.

Ford’s evolving agenda for Europe

Ford’s next phase centres on a product offensive timed for the late 2020s. A new family of multi-energy passenger and commercial vehicles, positioned as affordable rather than aspirational, is intended to offer customers gradual electrification rather than ideological purity. These additions will join the existing portfolio in 2028 and are pitched as a counterweight to both low-cost Asian challengers and European rivals accelerating their EV ramp.

The company describes this portfolio as a pathway to “sustainably profitable” operations, a phrase that signals Ford’s intent to avoid the margin erosion currently afflicting parts of the EV market. Europe’s regulatory direction of travel may be clear, but demand patterns are not. Electric vehicles account for 16.1% of new sales across the region, well below the level required to satisfy upcoming CO2 thresholds.

Ford presses Europe for regulatory realism

As Ford refreshes its industrial and product agenda, it is also making a political one. The company argues that Europe’s regulatory trajectory risks outpacing consumer readiness. The disparity between mandated CO2 reductions and actual EV uptake has sharpened tensions between policymakers and manufacturers.

The chancellor of Germany, Friedrich Merz confirmed on November 28 that he would send a letter to Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, urging the EU to ease plans to outlaw the production of ICE vehicles from 2035.

“We need to enable everyone to benefit from electrification and letting customers choose – whether that's fully electric or hybrid vehicles,” said Jim Baumbick. “It is about making the transition more attractive and more affordable for all consumers and businesses, stimulating demand rather than stifling it.”

Ryan Carlon, a homeowner in Westchester County, offered a blunt assessment of what he pays for electricity and natural gas.

""Middle of the wintertime I'm paying over a thousand dollars a month in the winter for my Con Ed bill,"" he said. ""Moved here from New Jersey and I was never paying more than a few hundred dollars.""

A report released on Thursday by Climate Power, a climate advocacy organization, shows energy prices have risen 13% nationwide since January.

Recently retired Susan Blair tries to blunt the impact of seasonal spikes by averaging out her bill to a fixed amount each month.

""Even from our level billing, it went up $100,"" Blair said. ""So, now if it's going to go up even more it's really tough on us.""

According to the report, the price of natural gas is set to spike. Experts say that's because much of the country's electric grid is fueled by natural gas, which sells for two to four times as much overseas.

""When manufacturers or suppliers would prefer to export it because they get a lot more money for it overseas... that's one challenge,"" said Parag Amin, a business analyst.

The other is increased demand from AI data centers, which require vast amounts of electricity. That's in addition to the Trump administration ending tax credits for solar, wind and other renewables.

""Which is really what can be built in the next few years to meet that growing demand. All of these things are coming together to create this affordability crisis,"" said Robbie Orvis of Energy Innovation.

New Yorkers were able to notch a small victory by speaking out. Experts say that New York has bucked the trend of these requested rate increases by utilities.

Con Edison had been proposing a double-digit rate increase. That has been scaled back to a pending of about 3%.

NEW YORK – This week, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (SRMT) signed a Performance Partnership Agreement (PPA) to memorializes the trust relationship between EPA and the Tribe while ensuring the continuation of the SRMT’s wide-reaching environmental programs. The PPA is accompanied by a Performance Partnership Grant (PPG) of over $11 million. The PPA lays out the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe’s environmental priorities and short- and long-term strategies to address them. This is the only such PPA that EPA has with any Indian Nation. The agreement is the sixth such agreement that EPA has had over the years with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. It covers 16 critical environmental and stewardship programs.

“I am proud to continue the amazing relationship between the EPA and the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and to ensure the continued success of their many impressive environmental programs,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “I was honored to stand with three Chiefs of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe as we sign this agreement that will strengthen our bonds of mutual respect and professional collaboration to help ensure a bright future for the Tribe’s future generations.”

“The SRMT Tribal Council acknowledges the many Tribal members who have led environmental initiatives at Akwesasne to get us to this moment,” said Tribal Council. “We greatly value and appreciate the continuing partnership with the EPA, which has been vitally important in helping to ensure a better tomorrow for our community.”

The PPA covers a wide range of programs, including air quality, Superfund oversight, water quality, hazardous materials spill response, solid waste management, environmental assessment, pesticide, and agriculture programs. The agreement includes a work plan that the Tribe will use to accomplish its environmental goals including improve environmental quality, enhance natural resources, and protect human health from chemical contamination exposures in air, water, soil, and cultural resources. In it are also performance measures to ensure goals are met, including regular interactions between the SRMT’s environmental experts and EPA experts. The Tribe and EPA will ensure that evaluations are performed formally during a scheduled meeting twice a year.

Background:

Performance Partnership Agreements Overview

EPA, states, and Tribes share responsibility for protecting human health and the environment. The unique relationship between EPA, states, and Tribes is the cornerstone of the nation's environmental protection system. Working together, EPA, states, and Tribes have made enormous progress protecting our air, water, and land resources. The National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS) was established in 1995 as a performance-based system of environmental protection designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of EPA partnerships with states, territories, and Tribes. By focusing resources on the most pressing environmental problems and taking advantage of the unique capacities of each partner, performance partnerships can help achieve the greatest environmental and human health protection.

Performance Partnership Agreements and Grants

One of the main ways EPA, states, and Tribes implement performance partnerships is by negotiating PPAs. These agreements set out jointly developed priorities and protection strategies and how EPA and the state or Tribe will work together to address priority needs. States and Tribes can also choose to combine funds from multiple federal environmental program grants into PPGs which allow them to direct resources where they are needed most or try innovative solutions to environmental problems.

Implication for Korean companies: Korean companies should anticipate greater opportunities as preferred partners in major regional projects.","The release of the 2025 National Security Strategy (“NSS”) provides the definitive strategic blueprint for the new administration’s foreign policy. While the NSS outlines a broad global framework, its core emphasis on geoeconomic competition and strategic reindustrialization carries profound and immediate implications for the Republic of Korea (“ROK”), its corporate sector, and the U.S.–ROK alliance. For Korean conglomerates (chaebols) that drive the nation’s economy, the NSS signals a pivot away from traditional security concerns toward a strategic architecture built on industrial alignment and supply chain integrity. Below are the key takeaways most relevant to Korean companies and the evolving U.S.–ROK alliance:

1. Geoeconomic Realignment and Strategic Supply Chain Mandates

The NSS formally embeds economic security as an indispensable component of national security. It positions the ROK, alongside the Quad partners like Japan, Australia, and India, as a critical node in a trusted network engineered to secure strategic supply chains, specifically mentioning critical minerals, emerging technologies, and energy infrastructure.

The NSS highlights U.S. dependence on concentrated mineral supply chains and calls for diversified sourcing with trusted allies. Furthermore, the NSS defines U.S.–China competition as systemic, mandating more stringent controls on the transfer of sensitive and dual-use technologies.

Importantly, the resulting compliance landscape does not present a binary choice between the United States and China; rather, Korean companies will need to structure supply chains and governance frameworks that protect U.S. market access while managing ongoing commercial exposure to China.

Implication for Korean companies: Korean companies active in EV batteries, advanced manufacturing, and strategic materials (lithium, nickel, rare earths) face a regulatory duality. They stand to benefit significantly from incentive alignment under U.S. federal programs and reshoring initiatives. However, participation is now conditioned upon rigorous compliance with increasingly strict U.S. regulatory frameworks, including Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) restrictions and proactive management of export controls and Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review risks, particularly where federal financial support is involved.

2. Increased Expectation for Defense Burden-Sharing and Dual-Use Capabilities

The NSS sets a clear and elevated standard for alliance burden-sharing. It explicitly calls for allies, including the ROK, to significantly increase defense spending and expand the industrial capacity necessary to meet collective security objectives.

It signals a focus on the rapid deployment and integration of cutting-edge dual-use technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, and quantum computing, recognizing them as immediate drivers of both national security and economic resilience. This signals a formal sectoral convergence where technological leadership is viewed synonymously with military and economic power.

Implication for Korean companies: Korean companies with capabilities in aerospace, defense, advanced robotics, and specialized materials should prepare for increased ROK defense procurement opportunities and a mandate for greater interoperability with U.S. defense modernization programs. As a leading global defense exporter, Korea’s defense industry stands to benefit from deeper integration with U.S. modernization initiatives, even while managing pricing and procurement pressures arising from U.S. tariffs and industrial policy constraints. Companies exposed to sensitive intellectual property or technology transfers, especially those with research and manufacturing footprints intersecting with China, must immediately reinforce their internal compliance and technology screening frameworks to mitigate export control and investment review risk.

3. Strategic Opportunities in Indo-Pacific Infrastructure

The NSS emphasizes private-sector–led economic engagement in physical and digital infrastructure across the Indo-Pacific region. The ROK’s globally recognized expertise in Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC), nuclear and renewable energy, smart grid infrastructure, shipbuilding, and critical manufacturing aligns strongly with these objectives.

Implication for Korean companies: Korean companies should anticipate greater opportunities as preferred partners in major regional projects. These opportunities extend beyond core construction to include advanced solutions for grid modernization, clean energy corridors, data center build-outs, and resilient port infrastructure. Although framed within an Indo-Pacific context, aligned opportunities will also emerge in the Middle East and Europe, regions where Korean companies already maintain a strong commercial presence, particularly as China plays a reduced role in U.S.-aligned infrastructure initiatives. Additionally, Korean entities should consider exploring funding structured through multilateral development banks (MDBs) and development finance institutions (DFIs), where they are well positioned to play a key role in structuring and deploying financing vehicles that accelerate infrastructure development in strategic emerging markets.

Conclusion: The Dual Mandate of Compliance and Opportunity

The 2025 NSS reconfirms the ROK’s status as an indispensable frontline ally and critical industrial partner in U.S. strategic, economic, and technological planning.

This standing translates into a clear, dual-track operational mandate for the Korean corporate sector. Korean companies will need to (1) seize the substantial opportunities created by U.S. industrial policy and (2) manage the growing regulatory complexities around supply chains, technology controls, and U.S.–China exposure. Success in the next phase of the U.S.–ROK strategic partnership will depend on corporate governance that effectively integrates proactive strategic alignment, guided carefully by legal and compliance advisors, with the practical realities outlined in the 2025 NSS.",https://www.hunton.com/assets/images-t1765557254/204247.png,N,,2025-12-12 12:01:03.441937

The parties intend to jointly evaluate the future development of New Rise Louisiana, a SAF facility comparable in size to XCF's New Rise Reno facility of ~40 million gallons

HOUSTON, TX / ACCESS Newswire / December 12, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX); Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (""Southern""); and DevvStream Corp. (""DevvStream"") (Nasdaq:DEVS) (together ""the parties"") today announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential Unified Commercial Platform and Strategic Integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, said:

""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform - linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

""Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered - not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.""

Potential Environmental-Attribute Monetization and Digital Infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream, said:

""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths - XCF's production expertise, Southern's developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream's environmental-asset monetization capabilities - to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.""

Potential Multi-Pathway SAF Collaboration and Offtake Framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern's planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern's in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF's HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern, added:

""We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.""

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF Facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern's biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana's growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern's existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added:

""We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern's developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.""

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals. Accordingly, the MOU does not commit any party to proceed with any particular transaction or project.

RWE Clean Energy just wrapped up construction on Lafitte Solar, a 550-acre installation in the Ouachita Parish area, approximately 4 miles south of Monroe. The 100-megawatt project will deliver electricity to around 17,000 households once it starts feeding into the area's power lines this year.

Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has agreed to purchase clean energy as part of its company-wide sustainability efforts.

The sheep are an eco-friendly alternative to gas-powered mowing equipment for keeping grass trimmed. Some people living nearby initially raised concerns about the project, but developers worked with the community to block views of the panels from nearby homes.

The project created around 150 jobs during the building phase and should bring in $32 million in local tax dollars during its operational years. For the environment, the facility will provide clean electricity without the pollution that comes from burning fossil fuels.

If you want to bring solar power to your own roof, adding panels is one of the smartest home energy moves you can make, potentially dropping your electricity costs to nearly nothing.

The planned data center would be located in unincorporated land in the heart of the city.

On Tuesday, the data center debate took over the Board of Supervisors’ meeting — even though it wasn’t on the agenda.

Now, the small city of Imperial is suing to bring the project to a temporary halt.

In a lawsuit filed late last week in Imperial County Superior Court, city officials are seeking an injunction that would overturn the county government’s approvals for the data center and block the developer from moving forward with construction.

The suit accuses county officials of violating California’s environmental laws, along with some of their own regulations, by prematurely greenlighting elements of the project. The city is asking the court to overturn any permits or approvals the county has granted so far.

Imperial is the county’s fourth-largest city, with a little over 22,000 residents. The planned data center would be located in unincorporated land in the heart of the city.

Imperial City Manager Dennis Morita said they ultimately decided to file a lawsuit because of the scale of the project — and because county officials appeared to be rapidly moving forward with little public input.

“The City Council also felt very strongly that its residents should have a voice in how this development happens,” Morita told KPBS Thursday.

On Thursday, representatives of the Huntington Beach-based developer behind the project, Imperial Valley Computer Manufacturing, said they had not yet had a chance to view the suit. But they argued the project is planned for land already set aside for industrial purposes.

“We will continue to engage in good faith, correct misinformation, and work with neighbors on specific, workable measures,” wrote Sebastian Rucci, a Huntington Beach-based attorney and managing member of the company, in a text Thursday afternoon.

Critics of the planned data center celebrated the city of Imperial’s decision.

Imperial resident Francisco Leal has lived next to the planned data center site for 18 years. In recent weeks, he has rallied his neighbors to oppose the project and helped organize a petition that has garnered more than 1,000 signatures.

Leal said he was inspired to push back against the project’s construction by reading about pollution the facilities can produce and the resources they consume. He said he doesn’t want his two children to grow up in the backyard of a massive technology complex.

“That gives us hope,” Leal said Thursday after learning of the city’s lawsuit. “That makes us feel like they got our back.”

Data centers are essentially massive, air-conditioned warehouses full of computer chips and other hardware and have been part of the infrastructure of the internet for a long time.

But they have become an increasing flashpoint in communities across the country as major tech companies like Google and Meta have sought to dramatically expand their footprint amid their frenzied race to develop generative AI technology.

That’s because data centers consume massive amounts of energy and water to power their computing equipment and keep it cool. Some facilities emit an audible hum. They also drive up emissions of greenhouse gasses.

In many cases, data centers are also built and run by private, third-party companies. As a result, the public has little information about how they are affecting the energy grid and environment.

On Monday, a coalition of more than 200 environmental groups demanded that Congress enact a nationwide emergency stop on data center development, calling it “one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation.”

The proposed data center in the Imperial Valley has a listed electric power rating of 330 megawatts, according to planning documents published by City of Imperial officials.

A megawatt is a measurement of how much energy the facility can receive at any given moment. Around 100 megawatts of electric power could support electricity for 80,000 households in the United States, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Rucci said the data center would require 750,000 gallons of water per day for facility operations. That’s equivalent to the daily water use of about 9,000 U.S. households, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Rumblings about the project have reached a crescendo over the past two weeks.

The increasingly heated discussion was triggered by an announcement the city of Imperial released the week of Thanksgiving. In it, they said the city had recently become aware of the data center project and was unsure how close county officials were to granting it final approval.

That uncertainty, Morita said, was key to their decision to raise the alarm.

“We did not want to be put in a position where we somehow waived anything relative to the entirety of the project,” he said.

Since then, hundreds of Valley residents have demanded more information about the project. Last week, California State Sen. Steve Padilla, D-18, sent a letter to the county Board of Supervisors calling for more public input and a full environmental impact report.

On Tuesday, the data center debate took over the Board of Supervisors’ meeting — even though it wasn’t on the agenda.

Residents, environmental activists and representatives from other advocacy groups packed the county administration building and demanded the county hold a public hearing on the project.

Rucci, the developer, has pushed back forcefully against the criticism, describing the project as “ministerial” — a technical planning term for a project that automatically meets county requirements.

“The property we selected is not some hidden pocket of farmland suddenly targeted for heavy development,” he wrote over text Thursday. “It is industrially zoned land near other industrially zoned and near major infrastructure--high-voltage transmission lines and railroad tracks.”

The City of Imperial disputes some of Rucci’s claims.

In court filings, city officials said the project site has several different zoning designations, including for urban farmland and various levels of industrial activity. Some of those zones, they said, do not allow data centers or the planned battery storage facility.

The battery storage and other elements of the project, the suit alleged, should have required a conditional use permit — a special permit that would require county planners to hold a public hearing and a formal vote.

The city also accused county officials in the suit of violating the California Environmental Quality Act by evaluating individual components instead of the project as a whole.

Rucci, the suit said, actually approached the City of Imperial about building a data center months before working with the county.

City officials weighed his request. Morita said they did see potential benefits in the project for the city and the county, and acknowledged that their suit could discourage other developers.

“I'm hopeful that we can get there in a way that this development can move forward,” he said, “but in a responsible way.”

Leal is less optimistic. Although Rucci has made promises that the data center would rely primarily on recycled water and renewable energy, Leal questions whether those commitments are true and whether they would be binding.

“We want to hear from the county because they're the authority,” he said. “They're the ones that got elected by us, so they need to tell us.”

Rucci is not the only developer with plans to bring data centers to the Imperial Valley.

On the north end of the valley, the Tustin-based start-up CalETHOS is also aiming to start building a 200,000 square-foot data center next year, along with a broader technology campus.

Key Changes The definition of ""energy infrastructure"" has been expanded to include critical minerals.
As under the previous EIR Program, eligible EDF Projects may ""include the remediation of environmental damage associated with Energy Infrastructure.""","On Oct. 28, the Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) released an interim final rule amending the regulations for the Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program. This interim final rule implements the Energy Dominance Financing (EDF) provisions enacted under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4. The rule takes effect immediately while inviting public comment through Dec. 29, representing a significant transformation of the program.

What is the Energy Dominance Financing Program?

The EDF Program is the rebranded and expanded successor to the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) Program originally created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While the EIR Program focused on projects that reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants, the EDF Program shifts the focus toward energy security, grid reliability, domestic resource development, and critical mineral supply chains.

The program authorizes the secretary of energy to guarantee loans up to a total principal amount of $250 billion through Sept. 30, 2028. The OBBBA provides $1 billion in new appropriations to cover credit subsidy and administrative. According to DOE, this rebranding reflects ""the material changes to the loan program established by OBBBA, as well as the type and volume of projects DOE anticipates."" The program is positioned as ""a core pillar to the Administration's strategy to win the global AI race"" and aims to enable projects supporting clean coal and oil and gas power generation, critical mineral supply chains, and nuclear industry revitalization.

The first deal has already been made. On Oct. 16, Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced the LPO's first deal under the EDF Program — a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for American Electric Power to overhaul approximately 5,000 miles of power lines across the Midwest. Notably, this project was initiated under the former President Biden administration's EIR Program but finalized under the new EDF framework.

Key Changes

The definition of ""energy infrastructure"" has been expanded to include critical minerals. Previously limited to facilities used for generation or transmission of electric energy, or production, processing, and delivery of fossil fuels, the new definition encompasses ""a facility, and associated equipment, used for enabling the identification, leasing, development, production, processing, transportation, transmission, refining, and generation needed for energy and critical minerals."" This expansion opens eligibility to projects across the entire energy and critical minerals value chain.

Eligibility criteria have shifted from a focus on emissions reduction to focusing on production capacity and reliability. The interim final rule eliminates the requirement that projects ""avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases."" Projects are now eligible if they: (1) retool, repower, repurpose, or replace energy infrastructure that has ceased operations; (2) enable operating energy infrastructure to increase capacity or output; or (3) support or enable the provision of known or forecastable electric supply at time intervals necessary to maintain or enhance grid reliability or other system adequacy needs.

The community engagement requirements for applications have been removed. DOE has eliminated the application requirement for ""an analysis of how the proposed project will engage with and affect associated communities."" This requirement, introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act and previously estimated to require 14 hours per response from 89 annual respondents, is no longer mandatory. The rule designates this change as an ""E.O. 14192 deregulatory action"" under Executive Order 14192, ""Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation.""

Electric utility pass-through requirements remain in place. Despite the removal of community engagement analysis, applications from electric utilities must still include ""an assurance that Applicant will pass on the financial benefit from the Guarantee to the customers of, or associated communities served by, the electric utility.""

Credit standards and repayment requirements are unchanged. DOE emphasizes that while the class of potentially eligible projects has expanded substantially, ""the criteria, rules, etc. used to determine whether a project has a 'reasonable prospect of repayment' (as determined by DOE in consultation with Treasury) has not changed."" The default rate projections remain consistent with prior program operations.

Environmental remediation eligibility continues. As under the previous EIR Program, eligible EDF Projects may ""include the remediation of environmental damage associated with Energy Infrastructure.""

Eligibility and Limitations

To qualify for EDF, projects must meet several core requirements:

Location: The project must be located in the United States or a U.S. territory.

Production and Transformation: The eligible component or infrastructure must be produced by the applicant through a process that substantially transforms materials, elements, or subcomponents into a complete and distinct product. Simple assembly or superficial modifications do not qualify.

Trade or Business Requirement: Production and sale operations must be part of the applicant's trade or business.

Meeting One of Three Criteria: Projects must either retool/repower/repurpose/replace ceased energy infrastructure, enable operating infrastructure to increase capacity or output, or support forecastable electric supply for grid reliability purposes.

The interim final rule makes clear that projects previously ineligible due to emissions-related requirements may now qualify under the expanded criteria. Examples of newly eligible projects include:

Upgrades or capacity expansions at operating natural gas or coal plants to enhance reliability or extend usable life.

Critical minerals extraction, refining, or midstream processing facilities that strengthen U.S. supply chains.

Grid-scale storage and generation projects that ensure forecastable power delivery during peak or reliability-critical intervals.

Upstream and midstream energy projects tied to domestic resource development.

Implementation Timeline and Next Steps

Effective Date: The interim final rule is effective immediately upon publication on Oct. 28.

Comment Period: DOE will accept comments, data, and information regarding this interim final rule until Dec. 29. Interested parties may submit comments through the Federal eRulemaking Portal (www.regulations.gov), email (LPO.IFR@hq.doe.gov), postal mail, or hand delivery to the DOE LPO.

Loan Authority Expiration: The $250 billion in loan guarantee authority under Section 1706 expires on Sept. 30, 2028. DOE has emphasized the need to move quickly to process applications and issue loan guarantees before this deadline.

Treatment of Existing Applications: DOE confirms that provisions of the loan guarantee regulations not amended by OBBBA remain in full force and effect. This allows DOE to continue processing existing applications already in the pipeline under prior Section 1706 guidance while expanding eligibility for new applicants under the updated framework.

Environmental Integrity Project (“EIP”) published a document titled:

State of Decline: Cuts to State Pollution Control Agencies Compound Damage from the Dismantling of EPA (“Report”).

The overall premise of the Report is that some state environmental agencies have seen significant budget cuts which will make it difficult for them to assume responsibility for activities that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) had traditionally undertaken.

The concern is driven by significant reductions in EPA staff and budget.

Congress provided the ability in the various federal environmental statutes for states to carry out (i.e., be delegated) the requirements of various programs for which it has charged the federal agencies with implementing. EPA can delegate to a state implementation of federal program if a number of required criteria are met. The assumption of such authority by a state from EPA is often called primacy. A state, territory, or Tribe with primacy, has primary enforcement responsibility, and can oversee the program in that state, territory, or Tribe.

Generally, the state regulates, and the federal government or/and EPA oversees the state regulatory program. In the event the state regulatory program is deemed inadequate, as determined by EPA it assumes the regulatory program or a portion of that program. Most states (including Arkansas) have obtained primacy for the various programs that can be delegated because they then become the primary authority for purposes of regulation and enforcement.

The Trump administration has argued that the states can and should have more responsibility to implement the various environmental programs. However, the EIP Report expresses concern about various states ability to undertake more responsibility for environmental oversight. The Report argues that more than half of the states have cut the budgets of their own environmental agencies over the last 15 years.

By way of summary, the Report argues that:

… These deep reductions mean that the Trump Administration’s proposed downsizing of the EPA would have an increased impact on pollution control efforts across the country. Not only will the federal pollution cop no longer be on the beat, state authorities may not show up either. Many states will not be able to shoulder more environmental oversight responsibilities because of years of their own cost-cutting, with a gradual erosion of their capacity for managing pollution often as bad or worse than the downsizing at the federal level.

The EIP Report undertook an analysis in the state of funding for the 50 state environmental agencies over the time period of 2010-2024. It also addressed the status of staffing levels over the same time period.

Examining the data for the state of Arkansas, the Report provides estimates for both funding and staffing during this time period. Arkansas’ environmental agency is stated to have recorded a 31% budget increase over the relevant time period, but a 17% drop is staffing.

What’s the approval mechanism, and then we allow that excess flaring first zero routine flaring upset condition.","(Kaieteur News) – ExxonMobil Guyana now has 14 days to address flaring issues before the company faces tax penalties, Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Khemraj Parsram has said.

Parsram was referring to the new environmental permit issued to Exxon’s 7th oil project – Hammerhead. The new permit has 14 provisions meant to address flaring offshore Guyana. There are also an additional eight provisions that speak to emergency events.

He said that the provisions are proof that the country has come a long way, in terms of improving on its permit conditions, while noting that air quality in Guyana is non-negotiable.

The EPA’s mandate is to ensure that the air citizens breathe is protected and according to Parsram, Guyana has always had a good history and record of excellent air quality. Therefore, as part of issuing permits to authorise and regulate the industry, he said the environment has to be considered and it must be protected.

“Now Guyana also has international obligations under the climate change convention for example, so our record there has been you know undoubtedly very rigid and strong. So, we have to maintain our air quality. Now any development, not just oil and gas, any emissions coming from these development activities must be regulated to ensure that they’re within standards,” Parsram explained.

The EPA head reminded that there was always prohibition on routine flaring, and from the start of the oil projects. Instead of burning the gas continuously as it came up as some countries do, Guyana told the operator and its partners that they are to re-inject the gas to assist with well pressurisation.

However recently, the option was given to bring the gas ashore therefore maximising the uses of the gas resources. Nevertheless, there are what he called “upset conditions” and one such instance was experienced with Liza One.

“They had a problem with the gas compressor and it took some time to get that fixed, and so the time taken for that we learn from it, and we ensure that in subsequent permits that there is a redundancy built in that,” he highlighted.

Parsram explained that there is often time just one gas compressor along with two or three other equipment that help with providing a quick fix situation. Notwithstanding, the key is still having preventative measures to ensure that if there is a need for flaring, it is efficiently done. In this regard, emissions will not have a number of dangerous pollutants that will be problematic as it can easily be dispersed.

“…and so those measures were put in place to make sure that flaring is prevented, and not just in terms of the efficiency, but when there’s a need for flaring there is also the aspect of how you deal with that, and there is it’s not just a carte blanch; You can’t do what you want, you have to seek approval from us and we set a stipulated timeline and date for that. So, 14 days maximum. So, if you know to address your situation, you have that time to play with it,” he further explained.

Parsram reminded that there is also a tax added on flaring, so this is now serving as a deterrent to indefinite flaring. With this cost attached developers are encouraged to fix issues right away, but still upset conditions will occur.

“There will be emergency situations. So, in those conditions we have to define clearly what those upset conditions mean. What are the circumstances around it? What’s the approval mechanism, and then we allow that excess flaring first zero routine flaring upset condition. Yes, we can allow you to fix the situation. If you exceed that time, then it’s taxed to get you to ‘hurry up’ in local language,” he added.",https://kaieteurnewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kemraj-Parsram-e1765415835521-150x150.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 13:01:43.701324

(NASDAQ:SAFX), Southern Energy Renewables Inc., and DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ:DEVS) have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to explore developing an integrated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) platform, according to a press release statement issued today. DevvStream, currently trading at $1.82, has experienced significant volatility with its stock price down over 14% in the past week and 73% over the past year, according to InvestingPro data.

The proposed collaboration aims to combine fuel supply, logistics, and environmental-attribute monetization into a unified commercial offering for aviation and industrial customers. As part of the potential partnership, the companies plan to evaluate developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana comparable to XCF’s existing 38-million-gallon New Rise Reno facility.

The parties intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways, including Southern’s biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology and XCF’s HEFA-based platform, while integrating DevvStream’s environmental-attribute capabilities.

""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform,"" said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global.

The companies also plan to assess municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following the Louisiana Community Development Authority’s authorization of up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern’s biomass-to-fuel project. This authorization remains subject to additional approvals and does not represent committed capital.

The agreement does not commit any party to proceed with specific transactions or projects, as any arrangements remain subject to due diligence, negotiation of definitive agreements, corporate approvals, and regulatory permissions.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, with global demand expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, according to figures cited in the announcement. For investors interested in DevvStream’s potential in this growing market, InvestingPro analysis suggests the company is currently undervalued, with additional ProTips and financial metrics available to help assess investment opportunities in the sustainable aviation fuel sector.

In other recent news, DevvStream Corp. reported a net loss of $11.8 million for its fiscal year ending July 31, 2025, compared to a $9.9 million loss in the previous year. The company completed its Nasdaq listing and secured an initial $10 million tranche under a $300 million convertible-note facility with Helena. DevvStream also disclosed that its crypto treasury program now holds approximately $5.4 million in digital assets, including 22.229 Bitcoin and 12,127.64 Solana tokens, valued at about $2.72 million each. Additionally, the company maintains approximately $1.28 million in cash within BitGo custody.

Also on the menu today: Ford and battery maker SK On break up their joint venture to make EV batteries in the U.S., and automakers warn against Chinese government-backed automakers and battery investments from entering the U.S., fearing American vulnerability if a confrontation breaks out.

30%: Why Tesla's Cheaper Models Are Getting A Cold Reception

2026 Tesla Model 3 Standard

Both the Model Y Standard and Model 3 Standard come in roughly $5,000 below the Premium trims. The Model 3 Standard starts at around $38,630 with destination and order fees, whereas the Model Y Standard is priced around $41,630. Tesla has aggressively decontented them, shaving off features in the name of affordability.

But more than two months after hitting U.S. showrooms, these budget Teslas haven’t delivered the sales boost the company hoped for. In fact, November turned out to be Tesla’s worst U.S. sales month in four years, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing Cox Automotive data.

Here’s more from that report:

“Demand for Standard versions was expected to support sales in November, but the company's total sales fell nearly 23% to 39,800 vehicles from 51,513 a year earlier and were the lowest since January 2022, according to the data from Cox, which tracks sales across the industry.”

""The drop certainly shows there is not enough demand for the Standard variants that were supposed to boost sales after the tax credit expiry,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights, said in an interview with Reuters. ""What’s also happening is Standard sales are cannibalizing into sales of Premium versions, especially the Model 3.""

To be fair, Tesla isn’t the only automaker fighting EV headwinds right now. The $7,500 tax credit has vanished. Fuel-economy rules have been weakened, nudging automakers back toward combustion models. With the EPA under a Trump administration moving to loosen emissions standards, the policies don’t appear to favor EVs anytime soon.

Unsurprisingly, overall EV sales fell 41% in November. Tesla’s market share, however, jumped to 56.7% from 43.1%. But even that comes with an asterisk: the third quarter effectively stole sales from the final months of the year as buyers rushed to snag the dying tax credit.

Industry leaders and auto execs say the real picture of post-credit EV demand won’t come into focus until the second quarter of next year. Against that backdrop, it’s no shock that Tesla’s half-assed Standard versions aren’t setting the market on fire.

The Model 3 Standard still feels like a decent proposition, starting late $30,000s. The nearly $42,000 Model Y Standard, though, is another story. It comes without lane centering (or Autosteer in Tesla speak), loses the horizontal light bars at both ends and skips FM/AM radio entirely.

It also swaps out the nicer frequency-selective dampers for basic passive ones. And the strangest change of all, Tesla has covered the glass roof with a fabric liner. According to Tesla engineers, adding an actual metal roof would’ve been more expensive.

Here’s more from that report:

""Tesla has a serious challenge on its hands next year when several other automakers are planning to roll out cheaper vehicles that are also full of fun features,"" Cox's Streaty said. ""So the answer is that Tesla needs a completely new vehicle in its fleet. Period.”

She’s not wrong. A new and fresh model, preferably on the affordable end of the market, could help Tesla bring in critical revenue. That or a radical leap forward with its Full-Self Driving (FSD) tech to deliver robotaxi revenue or meaningfully higher FSD subscriptions.

Until that happens, it’s unclear how the brand will continue to fuel its AI and robotaxi ambitions. Because don’t forget, Tesla’s bread and butter still comes from the old-fashioned business of selling cars.

60%: Why Automakers Fear Chinese Battery Investment In America

CATL Shenxing Plus LFP battery

The Alliance For Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing major U.S. automakers such as General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Stellantis, asked the Trump administration to further prevent Chinese-government-backed automakers and battery companies from setting shop stateside.

Here’s more from Reuters:

""China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,"" the group wrote in a statement for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles.

""No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent from happening inside the U.S.,"" the auto industry group said.

The group went on to cite national security concerns, claiming that the Chinese government could disable vehicles with Chinese-made software or components in case a major war were to break out between China and the West.

China has leapfrogged the U.S. in producing competitive EVs with cutting-edge software. Last year, the Biden administration proposed severe restrictions on Chinese automotive software and hardware in the U.S. to prevent misuse of the technology. And Chinese-made EVs are also effectively walled off from the U.S. with heavy tariffs.

90%: Ford And SK On Part Ways

In 2022, Ford and Korean battery giant SK ON, the subsidiary of SK Innovation, decided to invest over $11 billion in two U.S. battery plants for electric vehicles, one in Tennessee and the other in Kentucky.

The companies have now decided to end this joint venture amid slowing EV sales as battery makers now pivot towards stationary energy storage systems, which are still growing much faster than EVs.

As the two companies break up, SK ON will take full ownership of the battery plant in Tennessee, whereas Ford will assume full ownership of the Kentucky plant. SK will continue to grow its focus on ESS batteries, following in the footsteps of other battery makers such as LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, which have also been pivoting to ESS as EVs continue riding down a bumpy road.

Shareholders and users can also make their voice heard by expressing their disillusionment with Uber's broken promises, and their moves that hurt EV drivers.","Uber is under fire from both drivers and activists after rolling back monthly bonuses that incentivized the movement to electric vehicles.

What's happening?

The ride-hailing company recently rolled back the incentives that had been pivotal in encouraging drivers to switch to cleaner vehicles, per Bloomberg. Levi Spires, a driver from Syracuse, revealed the promotion had netted him around $3,500 in less than two years.

He and other drivers are disillusioned by the change that previously served as a way to cover the costs of paying a higher upfront price for an EV — though EVs at least carry significant annual savings over gas-powered cars through cheaper fueling and lower maintenance, such as no oil changes.

""My goal is for Uber to not be my main profession anymore,"" Spires said.

It is true that Uber still promotes EV usage through other means, such as discounts on new vehicles and charging costs. A newly announced $4,000 bonus to switch from gas cars covers only a subset of states and a maximum of 2,500 drivers.

The company, meanwhile, is trying to incentivize EV adoption through customer choice. What was once Uber Green and is now Uber Electric is a feature that allows customers with a preference for EVs to hail a ride from one.

""It creates demand,"" claimed Uber executive Rebecca Tinucci. ""That means extra rides that our EV drivers get.""

Whether that happens at a meaningful level in practice is unclear.

Why is Uber's pullback of EV incentives important?

Bloomberg pointed out that in the last three years, Uber's pollution has nearly doubled, according to internal documents. That has occurred as the company has made bold climate pledges like going 100% EVs by the end of the decade.

This move confirms that the company isn't going to come close to those goals, and while the intention may have been genuine at the time of the declaration, giving itself the ability to back out can be considered a form of greenwashing — in that the commitment was never fully sincere beyond any marketing value it may have had.

The more companies that don't live up to their climate pledges on pollution, the more daunting trends like record-setting temperatures and extreme weather will be.

Uber's support of the Big Beautiful Bill also drew fierce criticism. The bill took away many incentives for buying EVs, but for Uber it came with separate benefits.

One might've been altruistic in the partial no-tax-on-tips measure that could help drivers. Critics identified the bill's business-friendly tax cuts as the real driver behind their support, though.

""When they had a chance to get a big tax break and screw over the climate, they showed us who they really are,"" said Holly Burke, vice president of communications at climate advocacy nonprofit Evergreen Action.

It's worth noting, though, that Uber has partnered with one of America's leading EV-only automakers, Lucid, to develop its own autonomous ride-hailing platform to compete with Google parent Alphabet's Waymo and Tesla's Robotaxi services.

As that endeavor plays out with Lucid, Uber may be able to make a big leap in its percentage of electric rides, though it could still be paying its promised incentives to drivers in the meantime.

What's being done about Uber's about-face?

For drivers, there's not much they can do if the EV bonuses were making an important difference on their bottom line. Switching over to Lyft, likewise, isn't a perfect fix for users. Bloomberg recently revealed that Uber's top rival similarly withdrew its pledge to go all-electric by 2030.

Customers can still play a small part in a low-effort way by seeking out Uber Electric when hailing rides to support drivers of EVs. Better yet, exploring public transit options is a more planet-friendly way to get places.

The award represents a significant milestone for the project and for Imperial County, one of California’s most economically challenged regions.

The Jobs First Grant will support critical activities, including geotechnical engineering, foundation design, agricultural preparation, and procurement of key components for SVE’s integrated clean-energy system. These steps are essential to advancing construction readiness and securing full project financing for the $1.28 billion renewable infrastructure development, which will create 250 direct full-time living wage jobs and 15,000 jobs from planning through construction and plant start-up. The project will work in tandem with Imperial Valley College and the Imperial County Workforce Development Office to maximize local training and hiring opportunities.

“The Jobs First Grant accelerates the final steps needed to bring one of California’s most important clean-energy and agricultural revitalization projects across the finish line,” said Dave Rubenstein, president & CEO of California Ethanol + Power. “Sugar Valley Energy will deliver long-term climate benefits, stable employment, and a transformative new industry for Imperial County.”

The Catalyst Last Mile Proposal was submitted by IVEDC in partnership with CE+P, which has already invested $27 million to advance SVE from concept to shovel ready. The grant will immediately support jobs for key local project partners, including Landmark Consultants, Duggins Construction, Benson Farms, and Dubose Design Group and enable the project to begin construction on foundational elements of the ethanol plant.

“This award represents a major step forward, not only for the Sugar Valley Energy project, but for thousands of Imperial Valley families who deserve access to high-quality jobs and long-term economic opportunity,” said Timothy Kelley, president & CEO, Imperial Valley Economic Development Corporation. “The Jobs First Collaborative is helping remove barriers that have historically held this region back.”

Developed by CE+P, Sugar Valley Energy will be the first-of-its-kind project in North America. Once operational, the integrated biorefinery campus in Brawley, California will produce more than 73 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol, 771 million standard cubic feet of renewable natural gas (RNG), and 41 megawatts of renewable electricity each year from sustainably grown sugarcane.

Sugarcane cultivated on more than 48,000 acres of Imperial County farmland will serve as feedstock for the project, creating new revenue streams for more than 50 farming entities and supporting 2,000+ local agricultural jobs. The crop replaces less profitable forage crops and will help fill the void left by the 2025 closure of the Spreckels Sugar Company plant, which eliminates hundreds of jobs and dismantled California’s last sugar-beet processing industry.

Imperial County continues to face persistent underinvestment and the highest unemployment rate in the nation, notably 20.2% as of July 2025. The Jobs First Grant helps remove barriers to economic mobility by:

Strengthening workforce development and local hiring pathways

Expanding clean-energy and wastewater infrastructure

Supporting agricultural diversification and resilience

Creating jobs in a future-facing, low-carbon industry

Catalyzing regional investment tied to more than $200 million in federal investment tax credits.

A recent impact analysis found that construction and startup operations for SVE will generate more than $928 million in direct economic activity, creating 15,000+ construction and startup jobs and 250 long-term, family-sustaining operations jobs.

As California implements AB 30 and prepares for statewide E15 adoption, Sugar Valley Energy is positioned to become a major producer of ultra-low-carbon renewable fuel that supports the state’s climate goals and Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

Luxury FBO Million Air Austin (KAUS) and leading fuel supplier Avfuel Corp. came together to boost sustainable aviation operations at Austin Bergstrom International Airport with the addition of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The SAF—which went into service on Nov. 20, 2025—provides a meaningful solution for operators seeking to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from flight operations. This marks the first SAF location in Texas for both companies, offering a consistent supply of SAF specifically for the airport’s business and general aviation traffic.

“Austin is a thriving, business-centric city that also deeply values environmental responsibility,” said Roger Woolsey, CEO of Million Air Interlink. “Bringing SAF to Million Air Austin is about giving our customers meaningful options that align with both their travel needs and their sustainability goals. At Million Air, we believe sophistication and responsibility go hand-in-hand, and this step in our Beyond Green initiative reflects our commitment to making choices that support both our customers and our planet.”

“The Million Air team has been an exceptional partner to work with in expanding sustainable fuel solutions,” said Mark Haynes, Avfuel’s vice president of sales. “We’re proud to collaborate with them to establish our first consistent SAF-supplied location in Texas and help further their corporate initiatives on sustainability.”

The SAF, originating in Texas, has a targeted blend percentage of 30% neat SAF to 70% traditional jet fuel. For every 8,000-gallon truckload of fuel, the SAF provides a 19 metric ton reduction in carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 19.1 acres of U.S. forests per year. In its neat (pre-blended) form, SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

This initiative is part of Million Air’s Beyond Green sustainability program—a company-wide commitment to responsible aviation practices. The Beyond Green platform focuses on integrating more sustainable solutions across Million Air’s network, from renewable energy investments and facility efficiencies to greener fuel options, like SAF. Million Air Austin joins Million Air Albany (KALB), which partnered with Avfuel to bring SAF online this summer.

SAF is made from renewable and sustainably sourced waste materials, like used cooking oil. Once blended with conventional jet fuel, SAF is a drop-in solution that meets ASTM D1655 specifications and performs to the same standards as traditional jet fuel—requiring no changes to aircraft, fuel infrastructure or handling procedures.

“Our current budget situation requires us to reconsider bills that create expensive and labor intensive studies,” Moore wrote in a veto letter about the climate study.
“Maryland suffered devastating losses this summer due to climate change.
From extreme flooding to heat deaths, the impacts of climate change are costing Marylanders now,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network Action Fund.
Prior studies have endeavored to tabulate bits and pieces of Maryland’s costs from climate change.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) will announce Friday that he is allocating nearly $500,000 to study the costs of climate change in the state — just months after he cited cost concerns as he vetoed a bill to spend almost the same amount of money for the same study.

Friday’s expected announcement comes just days before a special legislative session Tuesday, when lawmakers are expected to consider overriding Moore’s veto of the RENEW Act — for Responding to Emergency Needs From Extreme Weather — which included the climate study.

“While the federal government has spent the past year rolling back climate protections and driving up energy costs, Maryland is taking a responsible step toward understanding the true price tag of climate damage,” Moore wrote in a news release Friday.

The bill was part of a larger effort by climate activists in Maryland and across the country to eventually require large fossil fuel companies to compensate states for the effects of climate change, including flooding and extreme heat.

The study Moore is funding, which will be administered by the comptroller’s office, will also evaluate any potential impact to taxpayers if fossil fuel companies are compelled to make compensatory payments to the state. A final report is due by Dec. 1, 2026 — the same deadline as in the vetoed legislation.

It is not clear whether legislators will still pursue an override of the RENEW Act veto, bill sponsor David Fraser-Hidalgo (D-Montgomery) said.

Report: Climate change imperils toxic sites across Chesapeake Bay region

“At the end of the day, I’m just excited to get going on the study,” Fraser-Hidalgo said. “I’ve been working on a version of this bill for five, going on six, years so I’m just excited to move the ball forward.”

Maryland isn’t alone in considering so-called “Make Polluters Pay,” or “climate Superfund” legislation. New York and Vermont have already passed legislation that will ultimately charge fossil fuel firms for a portion of climate damages. In New York, the tab is $75 billion over the next 25 years. Earlier this year, the Trump administration sued both states, challenging the laws, and those cases are ongoing.

In May, Moore shocked lawmakers when he vetoed a variety of studies, including one evaluating slavery reparations for African American Marylanders and another looking into the potential impacts of large-scale data centers in the state.

“Our current budget situation requires us to reconsider bills that create expensive and labor intensive studies,” Moore wrote in a veto letter about the climate study. “While such bills can be a first step to addressing complex issues and allow the signaling of support for an issue, the practice has become so commonplace that it is now a significant financial and staff burden on the state government.”

Since May, when the bill was vetoed, the administration has been able to secure a $30,000 grant from the Rockefeller Family Fund for the climate study. The remaining $470,000 will come from the state’s Strategic Energy Investment Fund over the next two fiscal years, according to the governor’s office. The vetoed bill would have pulled all $500,000 from the SEIF in fiscal 2026.

“Governor Moore has maintained that Maryland doesn’t have to choose between a green economy and a growing economy,” said Moore spokesperson Rhyan Lake. “By leveraging both philanthropic funding and existing state funding sources over two fiscal years to fully fund this study at no expense to Maryland taxpayers, Governor Moore is continuing to take action on climate and build a more sustainable Maryland.”

When Moore vetoed the RENEW bill, climate advocates were shocked, noting that the administration had not previously voiced opposition to the bill. Mike Tidwell, founder of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, called the move “unforgivable.”

But it’s possible that Moore’s about-face will help him to make amends, as Annapolis gears up for its next full legislative session on Jan. 14.

“Maryland suffered devastating losses this summer due to climate change. From extreme flooding to heat deaths, the impacts of climate change are costing Marylanders now,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network Action Fund. “We appreciate Governor Moore’s commitment to moving the climate costs study forward.”

Rockefeller Family Fund Director Lee Wasserman said the charity — which focuses on climate change, democracy and economic justice for women — supported the RENEW bill and others like it around the country, and was stunned by Moore’s veto.

“These costs are going to be landing on states including Maryland whether they figure out what they look like ahead of time or not, so it’s hard for me to imagine how achieving a greater understanding of the parameters of those costs could possibly be seen as negative,” Wasserman said. “To the contrary, it seems like good governance 101.”

“I’m less surprised that the governor has decided to backtrack, appropriately so, and give the state the opportunity to really practice good governance,” Wasserman said.

Prior studies have endeavored to tabulate bits and pieces of Maryland’s costs from climate change.

In 2024, the Maryland Department of the Environment estimated that it would take $1 billion per year to meet the state’s emissions reduction goals and transition to 100% clean energy. Amid historic budget shortfalls, the state has not allocated that amount to the effort, even though some programs are underway. Under state law, Maryland must reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels, by 2031.

An April report from the comptroller’s office indicated that Maryland experienced 85 natural disasters between 1980 and 2024, at a cost to the state of $10 billion to $20 billion.

Moore calls lawmakers back for long-anticipated special session next week

“Although extreme weather events have always occurred, scientists can now quantify how much more intense and frequent they have become due to climate change,” read the report. “Maryland can use this emerging science to assess the additional expenditures the state is spending due to anthropogenic climate change.”

That report also cited research from the Center for Climate Integrity, which supports climate Superfund bills, that said trying to build a seawall to protect Maryland’s coastlines from rising seas would cost the state $27.4 billion by 2040.

The RENEW study will be done under a memorandum of understanding between the Maryland Energy Administration and the comptroller’s office, the governor’s news release said. Comptroller Brooke Lierman said the report “will build a roadmap for financial resilience in Maryland amid the challenges of climate change.”

Lawmakers raided the SEIF fund for other uses during this year’s legislative session. The fund — which is supposed to be used on energy projects such as solar panels, EV chargers and energy efficiency upgrades for low-income households — was used to fund a roughly $80 energy bill refund for all of the state’s residential customers, and to help correct a massive state budget deficit.

The SEIF is funded in part by “alternative compliance payments” from electricity suppliers who do not meet the state’s renewable energy mandates. It had ballooned in recent years because it was cheaper for suppliers to make the alternative compliance payments than to buy the required renewable energy credits from clean energy generators.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/dsc_4543-1024x6811765554980.jpeg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=tKAwVEx8,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:55.923021

The community engages industry leaders who drive frontier segments of the energy system to shape the advanced energy solutions industry vision and narrative.","Global energy investment in 2025 is likely to have passed $3.3 trillion, with $2.2 trillion flowing into clean energy technologies.

That's a sign that the energy transition is still happening, but the language being used is different.

Today, the energy transition is about security, resilience and technologies. Here's how that plays out in 2026.

If 2025 felt confusing on energy, that’s because it was. Governments talked less about “saving the planet” and more about keeping the lights on, taming bills and managing the AI data-centre boom. Yet in the middle of geopolitical tension and economic jitters, clean energy spending quietly hit new records.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy investment in 2025 was likely to pass $3.3 trillion, with $2.2 trillion flowing into clean energy technologies – everything from renewables and EVs to grids, storage, efficiency and clean fuels. In other words, two-thirds of every dollar spent on energy is already going to cleaner options, even as climate rhetoric often takes a back seat to security and affordability.

Welcome to 2026: a year that is shaping up less as a grand climate “pledge moment” and more as a high-stakes execution test shaped around three themes: growth, resilience and competition.

Strategic competition in energy

The first motive for 2026 is growth through industrial competition. Industrial and economic policy are now the main levers for energy transition policies. Instead of classic “energy policy”, governments focus on industrial policy – local-content rules, tax credits, subsidies and trade measures – to achieve economic and strategic goals. In other words, it is a race to build factories, not just solar and wind farms.

This race has so far been dominated by China, which spends nearly as much on clean energy as the US and EU combined and leads manufacturing across most clean and advanced energy supply chains, cementing its status as the world’s clean energy powerhouse.

India also demonstrates great ambitions and progress in this race. The government introduced a number of policies, including incentives for domestic manufacturing and mandates for clean energy deployment. It not only drives massive deployment of solar and storage capacity, but also drives investment in manufacturing. The Dhirubhai Energy Complex, for example, is scheduled to start operations in 2026 and aims to host gigafactories of solar panels, batteries and electrolyzers under one roof.

Europe is rethinking its industrial model to regain competitiveness. The Net-Zero Industry Act aims to ensure that by 2030 at least 40% of the EU’s annual deployment needs for key net zero technologies are manufactured at home. The EU is also moving to recycle more critical materials and restrict permanent magnet and metal scrap exports in order to cut dependence on external supply chains.

Securing the energy backbone

Geopolitical tensions put energy security back at the top of the agenda, making resilience the second big theme for 2026. China continues its efforts to bolster the resilience of its energy infrastructure and grow its dominance in new technologies. Europe is pivoting away from Russian fuels, aiming to eventually phase out Russian gas, oil and nuclear entirely. The US is diversifying and onshoring sources of lithium, cobalt, nickel and rare earths.

At the same time, resilience now means economic and social stability too, from safeguarding against traditional risks to oil and gas supplies to affordable access and system resilience in the face of new threats – cyber, climate, supply-chain shocks.

Public focus has shifted to here and now impacts. This looks like foregrounding transparent benefits – jobs, community funds, lower local tariffs – in exchange for accepting wind farms, transmission lines, manufacturing sites or data centres.

AI and energy in 2026

The artificial intelligence energy surge is turning power into the new data-centre bottleneck. That surge is already changing corporate priorities. Bloom Energy’s 2025 Data Center Power Report found that access to power is the leading factor in data centre site selection, ahead of traditional concerns like connectivity.

In practice, that means competition for grid connections and flexible, low-carbon power options will intensify in 2026. Locations able to offer cheap, reliable and clean electricity at scale will have a structural advantage in attracting AI-driven investment.

Outlook: a more competitive, realistic energy transition

All of this sets up 2026 as a year less about new promises and more about competing for advantage in a messy, politicized energy landscape. In 2026, the projects that move fastest will be those that combine resilience with a compelling local story: cleaner air, stable bills, visible economic benefits.

All of this points to a different kind of energy transition in 2026, one that prioritizes:

Execution over ambition. Less focus on headline-grabbing net-zero declarations; more on whether grids, factories and ports actually get built on time.

Competitive advantage over moral positioning. Governments are less interested in being “climate champions” and more in securing the industries and jobs of the future – batteries, hydrogen, data centres, clean-tech manufacturing.

Near-term impact over distant targets. Air quality, bill stability and local economic benefits are now as important to the political calculus as temperature goals.

The energy transition is no longer a niche climate project. By 2026, it will be one of the main arenas in which countries compete, companies differentiate and societies negotiate what “prosperity” looks like in a hotter, more volatile world.

The Advanced Energy Solutions community

The World Economic Forum supports an integrated approach to energy solutions, including energy storage, advanced nuclear, clean fuels, hydrogen and carbon removal. No single technology will solve the energy transition alone; a mix of solutions will be needed.

Different regions, industries and companies will have their strategies, but they must work together.

Platforms, such as the Forum’s Advanced Energy Solutions community, can help speed up this cooperation and accelerate the deployment of new technologies, such as energy storage, clean fuels, hydrogen, advanced nuclear and carbon removal, from decades to years.

The community engages industry leaders who drive frontier segments of the energy system to shape the advanced energy solutions industry vision and narrative. It supports partnerships among innovators, large energy companies, energy users and investors and informs policy-making.",https://assets.weforum.org/editor/VO9aFcIDu7N8cDTdAZq9k9wTEumo7wOHGHzyWuo3n_o.png,N,,2025-12-12 11:02:52.541222

The gas company filed an application last year to be sold for nearly $1.3 billion to private equity firm Bernhard Capital Partners.
If approved, Bernhard subsidiary Saturn Utilities Holdco would take over New Mexico Gas Company, which serves more than 500,000 customers in 27 of New Mexico’s 33 counties.
“The proposed acquisition raises real risks of higher rates, reduced transparency, and long-term financial instability for customers across the state,” Torrez said in a statement.
“Right now, central evidence about Bernhard Capital Partners’ regulatory compliance history including violations, fines, audits and settlements involving their affiliates and formerly owned companies has been withheld from the record,” Pope told commissioners in November.","New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on Thursday filed a brief with the state Public Regulation Commission to oppose the proposed sale of New Mexico Gas Company to a subsidiary of a Louisiana-based private equity firm.

If approved, Bernhard subsidiary Saturn Utilities Holdco would take over New Mexico Gas Company, which serves more than 500,000 customers in 27 of New Mexico’s 33 counties.

In his PRC filing, Torrez argues that Bernhard’s reliance on short-term investments and private debt could lead to rate hikes; that its “layered corporate structure” poses a threat to transparency; and that its “complex web” of holding companies could thwart regulators’ oversight.

“The proposed acquisition raises real risks of higher rates, reduced transparency, and long-term financial instability for customers across the state,” Torrez said in a statement. “We are urging regulators to deny this application unless there are significant changes made to safeguard ratepayers from unnecessary costs and hidden liabilities.”

If the deal proceeds, Torrez contends that PRC members must enact restrictions on selling utility assets without PRC approval; offer rate credits for low-income customers; require competitive cost analyses before implementing new IT systems; and require funding for a “severe weather reliability fund” to protect ratepayers during hazardous weather.

A spokesperson for Bernhard Capital Partners in an email to Source NM said the firm has been “committed to active participation throughout the regulatory process.”

“Our application includes nearly $87 million in direct benefits to local communities, employees, and organizations. These commitments have been informed by feedback from these same stakeholders throughout the regulatory process,” the spokesperson wrote. “This includes $22 million in rate credits for customers, $7 million to assist families who need help paying their utility bills, and more than $2 million in charitable giving to local nonprofits. We’ve also committed $15 million to advancing community priorities, like economic development, workforce training, and renewable energy projects.”

Torrez is the latest public official to oppose the proposed sale. In November, state Sen. Harold Pope Jr. (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo) spoke before the commission and took exception to the exclusion of information relating to other companies previously owned by Bernhard Capital Partners’ founder.

New Mexico lawmakers Pope, McQueen raise questions about New Mexico Gas Company sale

Specifically, a 2008 U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General report said FEMA wasted millions by awarding no-bid contracts to the Shaw Group — a firm previously run by Bernhard’s founder — and others. A 2011 report commissioned by state leaders in Louisiana alleged that Shaw appeared to overbill the state by nearly $500,000 for building sand berms along the coastline to prevent oil from the infamous BP spill from washing onto the land.

“Right now, central evidence about Bernhard Capital Partners’ regulatory compliance history including violations, fines, audits and settlements involving their affiliates and formerly owned companies has been withheld from the record,” Pope told commissioners in November. “You cannot reliably weigh benefits against risk when the most relevant facts are kept from the public.”

The companies initially had a deadline to finalize a sale agreement in November, but recently extended it to Feb. 5.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:04:00.795899

While the North American EV market has cooled off a bit from its initial growth spurt, the Chinese and European markets continue to generate strong tailwinds for the broader industry.

According to Grand View Research, the global EV market could grow at a CAGR of 32.5% from 2025 to 2030 as cheaper and more power-efficient vehicles hit the market. To capitalize on that secular trend, investors should add a few promising EV plays to their portfolios. Here are two EV stocks that deserve a chance: Nio (NIO 0.39%) and QuantumScape (QS 5.16%).

Nio

Nio is a major producer of EVs in China. It differentiates itself from its competitors with swappable batteries, which can be quickly swapped out at its Power Swap stations as a faster alternative to traditional chargers. Its namesake banner sells a wide range of sedans and SUVs. Its newer Onvo and Firefly sub-brands sell cheaper SUVs and compact cars, respectively.

From 2020 to 2024, its annual deliveries increased more than fivefold, rising from 43,728 vehicles to 221,970 vehicles, while its annual revenue more than quadrupled. It achieved that explosive growth even as the pandemic, macro headwinds, and a pricing war rattled China's EV market.

Nio's vehicle margin declined to the single digits in 2023 as it navigated those challenges. Still, it rebounded to double-digit levels over the past two years as it sold a higher mix of Nio's premium sedans, reduced its production costs, and streamlined its other expenses.

From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Nio's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 31% as it significantly narrows its net losses. That growth should be driven by its rising sales of Onvo and Firefly vehicles, its gains in domestic market share, and its ongoing expansion into Europe. It could also spin off its capital-intensive battery manufacturing division to streamline its spending.

That's a bright outlook for a company that trades at less than one times this year's sales. Its valuation is still being squeezed by the tariffs and trade conflicts between the U.S. and China, but it could attract a stampede of bulls once those headwinds dissipate.

QuantumScape

QuantumScape is a leading developer of solid-state lithium-metal batteries, which generate electricity from solid electrolytes instead of the flammable liquid electrolytes used in traditional lithium-ion batteries. That difference grants solid-state batteries better thermal resistance, faster charging times, and higher charging capacities than their lithium-ion counterparts.

However, solid-state batteries are also more challenging and expensive to manufacture. That's why they've only been mass-produced for smaller devices like pacemakers instead of EVs.

QuantumScape aims to break that bottleneck with its QSE-5 batteries for EVs, which boast an energy density of 844 Wh/L (watt-hours per liter) and can be quickly charged from 10% to 80% in 12 minutes. Most lithium-ion batteries for EVs have an average energy density of 300-700 Wh/L with an average fast charging time of 20 minutes to an hour.

QuantumScape's batteries could make EVs significantly more energy-efficient, but the company has not yet commercialized any of its designs.

This week, a study by Cornell University and NPJ Clean Air revealed that in the first six months of implementation of New York’s Congestion Pricing program, toxic air pollution dropped a significant 22% in the Congestion Relief . The benefits of the policy extend far beyond its boundaries, with the study showing that air pollution declined across the five boroughs and surrounding suburbs as well.

The magnitude of this reduction exceeds what has been achieved in other cities that have implemented the policy, like London and Stockholm.

In January 2025, NYC implemented the first-in-the-nation Congestion Pricing Program, designed to reduce traffic and improve air quality while raising funds for public transportation improvements. Early data showed major reductions in traffic and rush hour delays, fewer crashes and noise complaints, and increased economic activity.

As Gov. Hochul stated in July, the program is on track to raise the targeted $500 million this year, allowing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to advance critical capital improvements to mass transit on its subway, bus, Long Island Rail Road, and Metro-North Railroad systems. These capital improvements include investments in zero emission transit buses, further improving air quality.

This year, the NYS Senate passed an equally important air quality improvement policy, the Clean Deliveries Act (S1180B), which would reduce toxic air pollution associated with the increase in mega-warehouses and e-commerce deliveries by requiring warehouse operators to gradually reduce emissions from their operations. The policy offers flexibility to invest in zero emission vehicles or take other steps to reduce air pollution from warehouse operations. According to a report by the Environmental Defense Fund, nearly five times more warehouse-generated diesel truck trips are estimated to have occurred over the last decade, compared to the prior decade, due to the warehouse boom. Impacts of air pollution from these facilities disproportionately impact state-defined disadvantaged communities, which cover 8% of New York but contain 50% of the mega-warehouses.

The following statement is attributable to Kevin Garcia, Senior Transportation Planner w, on behalf of the Electrify NY coalition:

“As the federal government denies science and rolls back basic public health protections, New Yorkers can breathe easier thanks to the success of our groundbreaking Congestion Pricing Program. But the work is not over and more must be done to finally deliver clean air to New Yorkers. The Clean Deliveries Act, passed by NYS Senate, would reign in toxic air pollution from increased diesel truck traffic due to the boom of e-commerce mega-warehouse operations, provide relief for disadvantaged communities, and help us meet our climate mandates. We urge lawmakers to build on the success of congestion pricing by prioritizing the passage of this critical bill in the upcoming 2026 session.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dsc_8337-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:02:55.955122

The report marked the culmination of a multi-year investigation that involved hearings and subpoenas and revealed numerous internal company documents.
Another category of oil company ads the report identifies as deceptive is one in which responsibility for reducing emissions is shifted onto individual consumers.
BP, through its advertising and PR, for example, popularized the concept of the individual’s carbon footprint, the report says.
The report comes as the industry faces dozens of climate accountability lawsuits aiming to hold companies accountable for deceptive conduct, including ongoing greenwashing and false or misleading advertising.","Four of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies have spent the last 25 years deceptively portraying themselves as leaders in addressing climate change while simultaneously expanding fossil fuel production and failing to meaningfully rein in their planet-heating emissions, according to a report released Thursday that examined over 300 of the companies’ climate-related advertisements from 2000 to 2025.

These ads collectively serve to mask the harmful impacts of the companies’ operations and to perpetuate a false narrative that the oil industry is an essential partner in the fight against climate change, the Center for Climate Integrity found.

CCI, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy organization supporting efforts to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for climate harms, said its analysis is the first of its kind scrutinizing hundreds of climate-relevant ads from BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell across the first quarter of the 21st century.

It was around the turn of the century, when outright denial of the reality of climate change had become untenable, that the fossil fuel industry pivoted in its messaging and advertising strategy toward promoting false promises and solutions for tackling the problem, CCI says in “Big Oil’s Deceptive Climate Ads.”

The report identifies and discusses seven categories of deceptive advertising during this time period, including overstating actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; exaggerating investments in renewable energy; deflecting responsibility by shifting it onto consumers; and falsely promoting natural gas, carbon capture, hydrogen and algae biofuels as viable climate solutions.

“Big Oil’s climate deception has evolved from lying about the problem to lying about solutions,” Richard Wiles, CCI’s president, said in a statement. “For two and half decades now, these companies have sold the public a false and misleading image of their industry as working to solve the climate crisis, all while doubling down on fossil fuels and making the problem worse.”

The analysis draws upon publicly accessible sources such as digital advertising libraries and archives, congressional investigations and reports, and corporate and public relations documents. It adds to a growing body of evidence of a decades-long and ongoing campaign of deception by the industry to deny or downplay its climate impacts, to delay the transition to clean energy and to obstruct climate action.

A joint staff report from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee and the Senate Budget Committee released last year documents how major oil companies use what the Democrats described as deceptive messaging and tactics to promote false promises of new technologies and to mislead about their commitments to reducing emissions and about the climate safety of natural gas. The report marked the culmination of a multi-year investigation that involved hearings and subpoenas and revealed numerous internal company documents.

“As this joint report makes clear, the industry’s outright denial of climate change has evolved into a green-seeming cover for its ongoing covert operation—a campaign of deception, disinformation, and doublespeak waged using dark money, phony front groups, false economics, and relentless exertion of political influence—to block climate progress,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), then-chair of the Senate Budget Committee, said in a press release accompanying that report.

Greenwashed or deceptive advertising has also been a key part of this campaign, the CCI report says.

“In advertisements targeting the public, these four Big Oil companies repeatedly misrepresented the sustainability of their business practices, deflected responsibility for fueling climate harms, and lied about the viability of their proposed climate solutions, from carbon capture and storage to algae biofuels,” the report concludes.

Inside Climate News reached out to BP, Chevron, Shell and ExxonMobil for comment. None immediately responded. Companies such as Exxon have pushed back in court against allegations of deceptive advertising by claiming the allegations are attacks on their protected free speech rights.

Overstating Green Commitments, Promoting False Solutions

Ads touting the companies’ emission-reduction initiatives, the report found, tend to overinflate the impact of these actions and create a misleading impression that the companies have dramatically lowered their overall emissions. But in reality, the actions typically are limited to oil companies’ operational emissions, such as reducing flaring, and do not account for emissions generated by their products, which make up the vast majority of their carbon pollution.

Furthermore, ads highlighting future plans or promises to reduce emissions and transition to low-carbon business models are misleading, the report says, especially considering that the companies are now rolling back their green commitments.

“In 2024, less than four years after advertising plans to change their business plans to support a shift towards net zero emissions, BP and Shell both abandoned goals to significantly reduce emissions and lower the carbon intensity of their businesses,” the report says.

Some other ads from these companies published since 2000 depict them embracing renewable energy like wind and solar, but as the report says, this obscures the reality that oil companies’ actual investments in renewables are miniscule: “One analysis found that between 2010 and 2018, BP spent only 2.3 percent of its total capital expenditure on renewables, Shell spent 1.3 percent, Chevron spent 0.23 percent, and ExxonMobil spent 0.22 percent.”

In some cases, oil companies are also abandoning renewable energy projects and cutting back on their low carbon portfolio spending. BP and Shell, for example, are scrapping wind energy development, and earlier this year Shell announced plans to slash investments in low-carbon energy from 20 percent to 10 percent of its total capital expenditure by 2030. This week, ExxonMobil revealed its updated corporate plan that includes reducing its spending on low-carbon investments by one-third.

Another category of oil company ads the report identifies as deceptive is one in which responsibility for reducing emissions is shifted onto individual consumers. BP, through its advertising and PR, for example, popularized the concept of the individual’s carbon footprint, the report says. These types of ads deflect from the role that the oil and gas industry has played in locking society into dependency on its products, the report contends.

Big oil company advertisements touting natural gas as clean or climate-friendly or as an essential partner to renewable energy ignore the reality that gas still contributes substantially to climate change, especially considering methane venting and leakage, the report says. Natural gas is composed almost entirely of methane, which is a greenhouse gas that is 84 times more powerful than CO2 over a 20-year timeframe.

In addition to promoting what the report calls the false solution of natural gas, oil companies have used advertising to highlight and push false promises about carbon capture and storage and about hydrogen, claiming these technologies are key to a low-carbon future.

Carbon capture technologies have existed for decades and have failed to sequester more than a miniscule amount of global emissions. Most carbon capture and storage operations also end up using the captured CO2 to extract more oil—a process known as enhanced oil recovery—which critics say cancels out much of the supposed climate benefit and serves to further prolong the fossil fuel era.

Hydrogen, meanwhile, is conventionally produced using fossil fuels, and so-called green hydrogen made from water does not yet exist on any large scale. Despite company advertisements touting hydrogen’s promise, it remains decades away from wide-scale deployment, and almost all hydrogen production today is based on fossil fuels, contrary to its depictions in company ads as a clean fuel, the report says.

The report also discusses advertisements by ExxonMobil around algae biofuels, arguing the company deceptively portrayed these fuels as a climate solution when in reality it was never seriously committed to investing and scaling the technology. “While Exxon poured millions of dollars into algae advertisements, the company never built a commercial-scale algae biofuels facility—which would have cost around $5 billion—and ended its funding for algae research entirely in late-2022,” the report said.

Resource for Climate Accountability Initiatives

Hundreds of ads across these categories from BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell over the last 25 years collectively “feed a larger false narrative that oil and gas companies are part of the solution to climate change,” the report concludes, which allows them to sustain their social license to operate while they continue expanding production and fueling the climate crisis.

The report comes as the industry faces dozens of climate accountability lawsuits aiming to hold companies accountable for deceptive conduct, including ongoing greenwashing and false or misleading advertising. Some of the cases are already in pre-trial discovery and are closer than ever to getting to the stage of a public trial.

CCI says its analysis is intended to support these efforts.

“Any business that floods consumers with such brazenly deceptive advertising must be held accountable,” Wiles said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1238013523-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:46.861238

The company is now said to be considering offering range-extended powertrains in sedans and crossovers for Europe and the United States. The discussions are reportedly part of a larger conversation as the automaker is preparing a new five-year investment plan.

Bloomberg reports the details of these investments will be announced in March of next year. That’s a ways off, but a spokesperson told the publication they’re “monitoring market developments and has reserved the range extender concept for its future EV platform.”

They added that consumer demand will ultimately determine when and where range-extended vehicles are offered.

Historically, Israel was the only country in the Middle East allowed to buy the U.S.-made jets.

“You’re saying to me now that the $600 billion will be $1 trillion?” Trump said to the prince. “Good. I like that very much.”

With a room full of people in the Oval Office, Trump then called on a GE Vernova executive.

“Could you say a few words about what you’re seeing on the job front … and also how we’ve been helped by the Saudis in terms of the kind of investment they’ve made? Please,” Trump said to David Broomell, the company’s manufacturing technology manager.

“Most certainly,” Broomell said, then laid out the company’s own investments amid increased demand for energy.

Of the more than $750 million the company is investing in its United States factories, almost $300 million is specifically for gas-plant parts, he said.

He summed up the total investment as “resulting in over 500 pieces of new equipment being installed in the Greenville, South Carolina facility” and roughly 1,800 jobs companywide.

The Greenville plant is just one beneficiary. The company has 18 locations in the United States and more than 45 overseas, including Saudi Arabia.

“We’re partnering with local communities to build the skill set that’s required to meet these capacity needs. So that talent pipeline is incredibly important. So it’s real jobs in the manufacturing space,” Broomell said in conclusion, before Trump told him to “say hello to everybody” in South Carolina.

The company declined to speak in further detail with the SC Daily Gazette about the numbers.

But according to a company announcement in January, Greenville is in line for at least $160 million of the total GE investment. Plans call for the Upstate plant to triple its output of natural gas turbines to 80 units annually for use in power plants, data centers and at a growing number of terminals that liquefy natural gas for export to other countries.

As part of that announcement, GE Vernova also pledged to hire 650 new workers at the Greenville plant.

The company pledged to spend an additional $100 million collectively on plants in New York, New Jersey and Maine.

Six decades in SC

The expansion is just the company’s latest investment in the Palmetto State.

GE has been a household name in South Carolina for some time. It announced its first plant — the Greenville facility — in 1967. The original building was 300,000 square feet and employed 500 people.

Today, the factory spans 1.55 million square feet and GE Vernova is the county’s second largest manufacturing employer, behind Michelin.

The company has more than 2,500 workers in the state.

It hires a lot of students from Greenville’s technical college, according to Max Stewart, CEO of the county’s economic development organization. Employees can make upwards of $30 per hour — $5 to $6 more than the county average wage.

“It’s definitely a great opportunity for people if they’re looking to do welding and they want to work in manufacturing,” Stewart said. “It’s a great company to work for.”

In nearby Piedmont, GE Aviation makes high-pressure turbine blades for commercial aircraft engines sold to Boeing.

And GE’s health care business in Florence employs about 400 workers assembling components for medical imaging equipment.

The company once had a factory near Ladson that made steam turbine generators for the nuclear power industry. The facility once employed as many as 1,200 people. But by the early 1980s, the nuclear boom went bust in the United States, and the plant closed.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ge_vernova_greenville-1-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 15:01:14.241866

Drawing on data from Power Technology’s parent company, GlobalData, this year-end review traces a year defined by contrasts. Renewables overtook coal in power generation while gas gained renewed interest; the sector registered record transaction values through fewer deals; and jobs ricocheted under the weight of geopolitics.

The picture that emerges is of an industry reshaping itself across capacity, investment and labour.

Capacity and generation: a change in hierarchy

Winners: renewables

If 2024 was the year of cautious optimism for clean energy, 2025 was the year the numbers caught up with the narrative.

Renewables accounted for nearly half of the cumulative capacity mix this year. Annual capacity additions appeared even more skewed, with 64.1% coming from solar photovoltaic (PV) alone and wind contributing another 16.4% – together, making up a staggering 80%.

This year’s growth in solar additions, which GlobalData estimates as 5% higher than 2024’s, was “fuelled by robust demand in China, the US, India, Brazil and rapidly expanding markets across the Middle East and Africa (MEA)”, says Harminder Singh, GlobalData’s director of power research and analysis. He points to supportive policy frameworks, climate-aligned national strategies and distributed energy systems as the key drivers but, most of all, the falling costs.

The solar supply chain has experienced oversupply, with production capabilities reaching nearly twice the demand for polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules. China has been instrumental as a manufacturing powerhouse, investing more than $50bn (352.74bn yuan) in solar PV supply production between 2011 and 2022 – and now accounts for 80% of global manufacturing capacity. India has also emerged as a new manufacturing hub, boosted by initiatives like the Production Linked Incentive Scheme.

Consequently, solar module prices further decreased, accelerating utility-scale solar deployment. GlobalData reveals that average solar PV project costs have dropped by 81% since 2010 and are expected to fall another 21% over the next five years.

“This, alongside improved grid access for solar PV as many countries invest in their transmission and distribution (T&D) networks, has made solar bankable for investors,” Singh explains.

Solar’s star power is showing no signs of dimming any time soon. GlobalData anticipates global solar capacity will reach nearly 3TW by the end of 2025 and surpass 8TW within the next decade.

Meanwhile, wind power is expected to register around 1.3TW in 2025, 93% from onshore wind and the remaining from offshore.

This year was particularly challenging for offshore wind. Weighed down by unfavourable US policies and tariff pressures, the sector saw funding pulled and projects paused, postponed or sold off.

However, Singh stresses that this is only “a short-term wobble”; the project pipeline remains strong, with a select number of countries leading the market.

Currently, the top eight countries account for 97% of global offshore wind capacity. This oligopoly is expected to continue in the coming years, but new players – the US, Poland, South Korea and Japan – will take the place of Denmark, Belgium, France and the Netherlands in the top rankings.

Renewables’ most symbolic achievement this year is overtaking coal in power generation for the first time. In 2025, solar, wind and hydropower combined accounted for 34% of generation, edging out coal at 31%.

“Despite tariffs, supply chain tensions and geopolitical headwinds in 2025, renewables kept expanding because their underlying economics and policy support are now deeply entrenched,” says GlobalData senior power analyst Pavan Vyakaranam. “Wind and solar remain among the cheapest new power sources, and long-term policy frameworks like the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and EU Green Deal created durable project pipelines.”

Losers: thermal power

Despite the milestone, Singh caveats that “reliance on coal is still going strong”, the demand for thermal power overall is “easing much more slowly than what the global headlines may suggest”.

Contrary to what the numbers imply, coal decommissioning does not always equate to thermal-to-renewable substitution. Instead, it is gas that has stepped in to take its fossil fuel counterpart’s place in several markets.

GlobalData forecasts that 2033 stands as the decisive tipping point when renewable generation overtakes all thermal generation (coal, gas and oil) combined, with solar PV and onshore wind at the forefront.

But even then, Singh says coal will remain the single largest source of electricity, “showcasing how deep-rooted coal is in many power systems across the world”. In South Africa, for instance, coal is projected to contribute 85% of the power mix in 2025 and remain at 59% even by 2035, underscoring the uneven pace of the transition despite promising milestones at the global level.

Meanwhile, gas-based powerremains pertinent in the power landscape. Long seen as a cost-effective and reliable source, gas attracted renewed attention this year for a different appeal: its ability to meet data centres’ soaring power needs.

Because gas power plants can be built in one to two years – broadly aligning with data centre construction timelines – they have become an attractive solution for developers facing immediate capacity constraints. That demand has translated into a wave of new gas projects commissioned in 2025, even pushing turbine suppliers into sizeable order backlogs.

In the US, where data centre power demand is most concerning, natural gas is expected to supply 40% of power generation in 2025, compared to 28% from all renewables combined, according to GlobalData. Although gas’ share is projected to drop to 32% in the next decade, the country still has more than 45 gigawatts (GW) of gas-fired capacity slated to come online between 2025-2031.

The US serves as a reminder that gas continues to act as a key stabiliser, filling the flexibility gap left by coal until energy storage, grid modernisation and interconnection capacity catches up.

Gas and coal accounted for modest shares (8% and 5.5%, respectively) of new capacity additions in 2025. The reality is: thermal power is losing ground. Equally true, however, is that it is still far from gone. For now, gas power in particular will retain a foothold as a lower-emission fossil option that can balance power systems as they race to modernise.

Winners: nuclear

The story of nuclear is one of a slow burn. Its share in the global capacity mix this year was small – only 3.8% with around 399GW – but the pipeline and prospects tell a different tale.

GlobalData projects nuclear investments to reach $41.8bn by 2030, reflecting its growing role in the energy transition. There are 63 reactors currently under construction, set to add another 66.2GW, but the real excitement surrounds small modular reactors (SMRs).

Alongside gas power, SMRs are emerging as a key source for data centre energy needs. In addition to “the synergies of nuclear power generation and the load profile of data centres”, Singh says, their smaller size allows for on-site deployment, minimising risks of transmission loss.

With 110 SMRs totalling 15GW in development, the next decade anticipates a slew of modular deployments.

Beyond SMRs, emerging reactor designs and next-generation technologies, including molten salt reactors and nuclear fusion, are reviving global interest in the energy source.

Losers: hydrogen

2025 spelled trouble for low-carbon hydrogen due to project delays, downsizing and policy uncertainty. According to GlobalData’s project tracker, cumulative 2030 capacity projections fell 10% from last year’s forecast.

The drop is even starker when the analysis is extended to 2035, with expected capacity to come online falling 28% and 26% year on year (YoY) for high and low-case scenarios respectively. Reflecting the revisions in project scale and timelines announced this year, forecasted average capacity from projects with start years between 2031-2035 declined from 1,350 thousand tonnes per annum (ktpa) to 300ktpa.

These setbacks, combined with ongoing controversies around greenwashing and feasibility, are raising questions as to whether it will come to the fore as an emission reduction technology before 2040 – if at all.

Deals: North America takes the reign

According to GlobalData, the global power industry recorded 16% fewer deals in 2025 compared to 2024 but experienced a 15% surge in total deal value.

Deal values jumped across most deal types, with mergers and acquisitions (M&A) leading the way. With acquisitions growing 23.96% YoY (2024 compared to 2025 year-to-date, 9 December 2025), compared to the same period the year before and mergers a whopping 123.43%, the sector registered a total M&A value of $391.47bn.

Every region saw fewer transactions this year but not less value. North America dominated with 1,659 deals worth $780.5bn, surging 31.61% YoY in value. Compare this to the more modest gains seen in Asia-Pacific (9%) and MEA (1%), it is clear that the region is sustaining its momentum following the 55.9% YoY growth it registered last year.

The US alone registered $689.43bn in total power sector deals, followed by India ($93.88bn), China (85.52bn), the UK ($82.46bn), Japan ($81.94bn) and Canada ($81.53bn).

Asia Pacific had a few hundred more deals than North America that totalled only half the value at $394.7bn.

“This data reflects North America’s multiple mega-deals in 2025, such as Essential Utilities’ $30bn merger with American Water Works, which significantly lifted its aggregate deal value,” explains Vyakaranam, pointing to Constellation Energy’s $16.4bn acquisition of Calpine, NRG Energy’s £12bn purchase of LS Power’s Premier Power Portfolio, and Blackstone Infrastructure’s £11.5bn acquisition of TXNM Energy as primary examples.

Europe recorded $342.7bn, moderately behind Asia-Pacific, via a number of deals similar to that of North America. South and Central America and MEA both had under 200 deals worth less than $50bn.

In terms of sector, solar PV deals came out on top with 1,412 transactions totalling roughly $480.2bn. However, the largest share of capital ($557.3bn) flowed into T&D, which saw a fewer deals (1,223), reflecting the large-scale and capital-intensive natureof T&D projects as well as the vitalised global focus on upgrading grid infrastructure.

Deal activity in wind, fossil fuels, hydropower and energy storage remained steady, ranking above other sectors like nuclear and biopower in both numbers and value.

Looking ahead, Vyakaranam says “deal activity in 2026 will be shaped by rapid expansion of renewable energy and storage, the growing role of digital infrastructure such as AI and data centres, and focused initiatives to strengthen supply chain resilience and grid reliability”.

Jobs: peaks, troughs and expertise shifts

No part of the power sector illustrated 2025’s volatility more than employment. A rollercoaster of a year, hiring across the global power sector spiked dramatically in the first quarter (Q1), reaching record highs, only to collapse in Q2 and decline gradually throughout Q3 and Q4.

According to Vyakaranam: “Power sector employment in 2025 swung sharply due to overlapping policy, seasonal and weather-related pressures.”

He explains: “Jobs surged in Q1, benefitting from strong late‑2024 economic momentum, as companies accelerated hiring ahead of tighter clean energy tax credit rules under the IRA, front-loaded recruitment for spring and summer construction seasons, and in anticipation of rising demand from data centres and industry.

“But in Q2, hiring fell abruptly as new ‘Foreign Entity of Concern’ requirements disrupted supply chains and delayed projects, while unusually early and prolonged monsoon conditions in key markets like India slowed construction activity and dampened electricity demand.”

In the latter half of the year, he says employment stagnated as companies “focused on adapting to the new regulatory environment, reassessing demand, and prioritising efficiency and digitalisation over large-scale expansion”, resulting in more targeted, specialised recruitment over broad workforce growth.

One expertise area was singled out: tariffs. According to GlobalData, tariff-related job postings in the power sector grew 657% from last year, illustrating the impact of US trade policies on the global energy market.

Going into 2026, Vyakaranam expects the recruitment landscape to remain highly specialised, with companies prioritising expertise in “grid planning and reliability, energy storage, regulatory and tax strategy, supply‑chain risk management, and digital and analytics functions to support smart grids and asset optimisation”.",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/12/shutterstock_2712992151-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:32.360590

Hot rocks might be the next big thing in energy.

Global investment in geothermal energy is growing quickly — and it’s expected to keep climbing in the years to come, per new data from research firm Rystad Energy.

At the start of the 2020s, less than $2 billion flowed each year toward projects that harness the Earth’s natural underground heat to either produce electricity or directly warm buildings. By 2030, that figure could hit nearly $9 billion, Rystad predicts.

Geothermal systems have been around for decades in places where the Earth’s warmth sits close to the planet’s surface — think regions with lots of hot springs, for example. But decarbonization goals and rising power demand are fueling renewed enthusiasm for the always-available clean energy source, and emerging technologies mean companies can tap into it in areas with more challenging terrain.

Geothermal heating is most popular in Europe, where there’s growing interest in using the energy source for thermal networks that can warm up multiple buildings. Iceland, which has long leveraged its volcanic geology to keep homes toasty, is the famous example here.

When it comes to electricity, geothermal makes up less than 1% of the world’s supply. The U.S. is the global leader in terms of geothermal power capacity, with much of it located in California’s steamy Geysers region. It’s no surprise, then, that America is among the countries investing the most in the energy source, topping the chart this year and last.

Rystad doesn’t expect the U.S. to be No. 1 for much longer, predicting that volcano-laden Indonesia will steal the top spot for investment starting in 2027. Even so, geothermal could have a bright future in the U.S. It’s something of a unicorn: a clean energy source that has broad support among both Democrats and Republicans.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/cotw-geothermal-3.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=30aa86e577ececd42803e2273f0d8138,N,,2025-12-12 12:01:12.020740

In 2026, homeowners who install a heat pump will no longer be able to apply for federal tax credits amounting to 30 percent off installation costs or new equipment.

At the same time, a pilot program from Central Maine Power that charged a lower rate in the winter to certain customers with heat pumps is also set to expire.

This means that homeowners may see costs associated with installing and running a heat pump go up next year, particularly as electricity rates continue to climb. Maine’s average electricity prices increased at the third highest rate in the country over the last decade, a previous analysis by The Maine Monitor found.

The federal energy efficiency tax credits, established under Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, are set to expire earlier than planned because of changes made this summer in President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Federal home energy rebates for low- and moderate-income families, however, will remain in place.

Efficiency Maine Trust, the quasi-state agency responsible for energy programs, plans to continue offering several types of heat pump rebates, including up to $9,000 for low-income customers and up to $3,000 for any income level.

Efficiency Maine has no plans to modify its heat pump incentives when the federal tax credits expire, according to executive director Michael Stoddard. Funding for the heat pump rebates comes from a variety of sources, including electric utilities, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act and a grant from the federal Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Other efforts to increase heat pump adoption and make them more affordable are underway.

Maine is part of a five-state coalition called the New England Heat Pump Accelerator, a $450 million effort that launched last month to get more heat pumps installed by offering financial incentives to distributors and contractors; supporting new pilot programs and workforce development efforts; and improving educational outreach. The accelerator was funded with money from the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program created by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Maine surpassed Gov. Janet Mills’s goal to install 100,000 heat pumps by 2025 back in 2023. Now the state is working toward installing 275,000 units by 2027.

Maine Won’t Wait, the state’s climate action plan, tallied 143,000 heat pumps installed at the end of 2024. Rebates, combined with energy bill savings, have made heat pumps a popular alternative to heating systems that use oil, gas or propane.

Whereas traditional heating systems can only turn on and off, a heat pump can ramp up and down, said Shawn LaPlante, co-owner of LaPlante Home Services in Scarborough.

“It can use a little bit of electricity. It can use a lot of electricity when it needs it, and then it can go back down to a little bit of electricity. So it has the ability to vary,” LaPlante said.

In addition to reducing carbon emissions, as The Maine Monitor has previously reported, cost savings associated with heat pumps have become a key part of the sales pitch. The clean energy think tank RMI calculated that, in Maine, a household can expect an average of $700 in energy bill savings annually after switching from delivered fuel to a heat pump.

Ryan Shea is the manager of RMI’s buildings team, which focuses on research and policies related to reducing carbon emissions and boosting efficiency. Shea said the annual cost savings calculations were made using RMI’s Green Upgrade Calculator, which factors in details about a given home, such as its size and when it was built, as well as energy rates, heat pump type and climate.

“There really is a lot that goes into quantifying energy bills, especially when you're switching fuels,” said Shea. “What this tool tries to do is factor in all of those inputs and generate an output that's quite accurate.”

When stacked against the cost of installation, LaPlante said most customers can expect to make back their initial investment in five to eight years, depending on their circumstances. LaPlante said there’s been a “slight uptick” in the number of customers looking to install heat pumps since the change was announced to the federal tax credits

“This just gave them a little push to say, well, why not, because I can get the federal tax credit,” LaPlante said. “It's an extra $2,000 potentially, so I think that allowed them to push up their timeline, but they had to have already been thinking about it.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_maine_monitor_337/c8c78e0fa2584379af47b05269398226,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:26.648496

Significant Changes May Be Coming to Fuel Economy Rules

The Trump administration is preparing a rollback of increased federal automobile fuel efficiency standards enacted under President Biden. They are aiming to lower the cost of gasoline-powered vehicles and reverse federal efforts to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles (EVs).

Fuel economy standards have been in place since 1975 to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil and to push manufacturers toward more efficient vehicle technologies. Under a rule finalized in 2024, the Biden administration required automakers to reach an average of roughly 50 miles per gallon by 2031. Federal officials estimated that these standards would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save consumers billions in fuel costs.

President Trump has long opposed federal support for EVs, and earlier this year, the Transportation Department initiated a review of the Biden-era standards, arguing they improperly relied on electric vehicle performance to set more stringent requirements. Weakening the rules would increase pollution and leave the United States less competitive in the rapidly growing global EV market.

Following the proposal’s release, the Transportation Department will hold a public comment period before finalizing the rule next year. The Environmental Protection Agency is also expected to introduce its own revisions to greenhouse gas standards for cars and trucks in the months ahead.

News and Updates

Administration Proposes Opening Florida & California Waters to Oil Drilling

Trump’s administration has proposed an expansive five-year offshore oil and gas leasing plan that would reopen federal waters off the California coast to drilling for the first time in forty years, while reviving longstanding political battles in the other states. The draft schedule, extending from 2026 to 2031, considers up to 34 lease sales through auctions in California, Alaska, and the eastern Gulf. Many of them would begin after President Trump’s term ends.

However, state legislators have sharply pushed back on the proposal. California lawmakers emphasized that federal leasing would face steep regulatory and legal barriers, including the state’s authority over coastal infrastructure needed to support drilling.

The plan also reignites conflict among Florida Republicans, who have historically opposed offshore drilling out of concern for the state’s tourism economy and military training areas. Despite a long-standing moratorium on drilling off Florida’s coast, which had been extended by Trump during his first term until 2032, the proposal includes lease sales in a newly-named “South-Central Gulf of America” region adjacent to the Florida panhandle.

Beyond California and Florida, the schedule also proposes extensive leasing in Alaska. The draft plan will undergo a multi-stage public comment process, with a revised schedule expected next year before the Interior Department finalizes the program.

COP30 Struggled to Achieve Robust Climate Deal

Nearly 200 countries meeting in Belém, Brazil for COP30 acknowledged that global efforts to curb dangerous warming remain insufficient, but deep geopolitical divisions prevented a stronger agreement. The final deal urges nations to enhance climate action and provide more predictable funding for vulnerable countries, yet it omits a proposal backed by the EU to accelerate the global transition away from fossil fuels.

The talks were marked by the unprecedented absence of the United States, which withdrew after President Trump abandoned the Paris Agreement. Without U.S. engagement, emerging economies and oil states succeeded in removing explicit references to phasing out fossil fuels from the final text. EU members, initially hesitant, accepted the watered-down agreement after securing limited revisions.

Brazil notably secured a modestly stronger outcome than its earlier drafts, including aspirations for reducing fossil fuel use and deforestation. The final text, however, remains nonbinding. Still, many countries framed the agreement as an important reaffirmation of multilateral cooperation at a moment of heightened political tension.

Three years ago, I wrote a piece on Winter Storm Elliott on Substack. It was less than two years after Winter Storm Uri and the memories were still raw. People were hurting, worried, and hungry for truth. My goal, very simply, was to fill that informational void.

That piece struck a chord, and the Texas Energy & Power Newsletter was born. For three years, we’ve provided a signal through the noise surrounding energy in Texas. Many of you even pledged crucial financial support, which enabled the launch of the Energy Capital Podcast, which has become an important platform for so many brilliant energy experts and helped a broader audience navigate energy complexities in ERCOT and beyond.

Doing this work and growing these platforms have been among the highest privileges of my career. But things are about to change. I’m starting a new job (more on that in coming days), which obviously will trigger some changes at both the Texas Energy & Power Newsletter and the Energy Capital Podcast.

But again, this isn’t just a transition. It’s an expansion.

At the newsletter, a stellar group of writers will deliver the energy information that Texans continue to crave. Stay tuned for more on that soon. And at the podcast, a talented group of new hosts, along with Nathan Peavey, the talented producer responsible for the podcast’s high quality over the last year, will keep this thing rolling and growing. (Look for one later today!)

As with the electric grid itself, a network of diverse resources is more resilient than a singular, centralized one. We’re building the former. This is an opportunity for more voices to use this platform and grow it.

This publication was never about me. It was always about the critical need for independent energy coverage in the biggest energy state in the country. This new crew will continue to deliver it. In fact, I’m excited to become a paid subscriber myself. Because I need this reporting as much as you do: there’s still not enough focused energy coverage in Texas, and this platform is more critical than ever.

Sustainable food access for the next generation Brown also opens his operation to aspiring farmers, demonstrating how to create local food systems and agritourism opportunities.","Most days, Patrick Brown kneels in the red clay of Warren County, North Carolina, running the soil through his fingers.

His roughly 300 acre farm has been in his family since 1865 and has survived crisis after crisis. Now it has another important job to do — affordably feeding families in one of the state’s most persistent food deserts. It is not an easy task in a place where climate threats like storms are expected to cause the area to lose more crops and farmlands this century than pretty much anywhere else.

Brown is a regenerative farmer. Regenerative agriculture is a way of farming where you treat the soil like a living sponge by keeping it covered with plants, minimizing plowing, and adding compost so that each year the land grows richer, holds more water, and supports more life instead of being worn out.

By caring for the land, he said, it makes it easier to care for his neighbors. His farm delivers boxes of fresh produce to local families who otherwise wouldn’t have access, through a Community Supported Agriculture program, and he teaches others how to farm sustainably.

In a majority Black, low-income community with almost no other fresh-food outlets, his CSA is one of the few direct sources of fruits and vegetables. His town, Henderson, North Carolina, has only one grocery store for its 14,000 residents, a scarcity that Brown says creates “a convenience market for processed food” to flood the area and promotes chronic illness.

Brown’s program model operates on direct subscriptions of $25 per week, eliminating middlemen and connecting consumers directly to their food source at a price well below what most North Carolina grocers are offering. This year, he has over 100 members. Virtually all of his members are Black, he said, and they receive weekly boxes of vegetables accompanied by recipes that teach which foods benefit specific health conditions.

While the exact size of the boxes vary by the season, CSA boxes are typically a better value for customers because CSA farmers tend to include higher-value and specialty and native crops that are not found in grocery stores.

“It gives the opportunity to learn and educate themselves on obesity and what non-processed foods can offer compared to processed foods they’ll get at a Dollar General or Dollar Tree,” Brown explained.

Not only do the families in his community benefit from his eco-friendly CSA, the soil does, too. Brown plants ‘cover crops’ like rye and buckwheat to blanket the soil in winter, helping it hold onto moisture for spring planting and making his fields less vulnerable to the droughts that have accompanied climate change as it heats the atmosphere and pulls more moisture out of land and plants. His focus on sustainability offers a model for other farms nationwide. Less than 5% of U.S. farms use regenerative soil practices.

“We have to bridge the gaps and create ways and opportunities for producers like myself, nonprofits, and for-profits to see what ways can help diversify opportunities to create gaps and bridge for climate resilience,” he said.

How innovation is fighting North Carolina’s food deserts

Programs like Brown’s are part of a broader push to sustainably close food gaps across North Carolina.

Research shows CSAs can improve food access in rural food deserts. These programs can boost the amount of produce families eat, offer it at prices that are as low as or lower than other local options, and cut down on long trips to distant grocery stores by providing more convenient pickup sites.

But traditional models often struggle to reach low-income households. Brown and other CSAs in North Carolina address this by focusing on affordability and education, reducing barriers through subsidized shares, offering payment plans, and accepting food assistance like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Electronic Benefits Transfer (SNAP/EBT).

At North Carolina A&T University, a multidisciplinary team recently launched the Fresh & Local Nutrition Incentive Program, which reduces barriers by offering half-priced CSA boxes to people using SNAP benefits at a weekly campus market in East Greensboro.

The project uses a ‘double-up’ model that matches SNAP dollars at a campus market, turning a $10 swipe into a box of in-season fruits and vegetables worth twice as much.

The impact extends beyond nutrition.

Brown said he’s watched community members learn where their food comes from and how to sustain themselves on the land they inhabit.

One longtime customer told him she’d never cooked some of the vegetables in the box before the recipes started arriving each week, but now her kids “ask when the farm box is coming” and help wash and prep the produce.

The plight of Black farmers

During the Biden administration, urban and small-scale farming initiatives received backing. The administration created more ways to deliver loans, and funded partnerships with community groups so food could reach those most in need.

But there have been cuts during the Trump administration. The administration rolled back federal support for minority-owned farms and cut the Regional Food Business Centers program, which provided up to $100,000 in grant funding to small and midsized farms.

Federal data shows that a majority of Black-operated farms report very low annual sales compared with all farms and are more likely to need grants.

Yet, Black farms are less likely to receive support. USDA loan programs granted loans to 72% of white applicants in 2022, but only 36% of Black applicants. The disparity extends beyond financing. North Carolina’s Black farmers owned just 3% of farms in 2017.

Climate change compounds the pressures on the remaining Black farmers. While regenerative practices build soil and land resilience, farmers “really don’t have any control” over extreme weather events, Brown said. Hurricanes and rainstorms flood fields and strip away topsoil, while the increasing number of winter storms freeze and kill crops and damage tools and equipment.

To keep his operation viable, Brown has made a strategic shift away from commodity agriculture, which is when big, single-crop farms grow things like corn and soy mainly for food corporations.

Rather than gambling on commodity prices, Brown focuses on specialty crops: organic wheat for direct retail sale and industrial hemp fiber for textile and building manufacturing. He often sells hemp to clothing companies like The North Face and Patagonia, and also directly to consumers on his website.

But Brown is candid about limitations as the Trump administration’s support for Black farmers dwindles.

Brown said he would not advise someone to start the farming journey without outside income, due to the compounding situation of declining federal support and climate threats. “I would advise them, especially during times now where there are no programs available for them to get started, to do as little as they can to get to where they want to be, but to apprentice at a farm where they can learn more over a period of time.”

Pathways to learn from farmers still exist. Organizations like WWOOF-USA connect aspiring growers with over 1,400 host farms nationwide for hands-on training.

Sustainable food access for the next generation

Brown also opens his operation to aspiring farmers, demonstrating how to create local food systems and agritourism opportunities.

Many weekends out of the year, teens gather at Brown’s farm as he pulls carrots from the soil, handing them over for tasting while explaining how the cover crops beneath their feet hold moisture through droughts. Aspiring farmers from nearby lots shadow him, watching as he packs CSA boxes with recipes and diabetes-fighting greens.

Brown is building a model for how Black farmers can reclaim both land and legacy on a farm that his family has fought hard to retain control of.

He is tilling the same soil that his ancestors worked — first as enslaved people and then as sharecroppers during the reign of Jim Crow.

And it’s the same ground his father stood on four decades ago as trucks rolled past carrying toxic waste to a nearby landfill in 1982.

Brown’s father, Arthur Brown, a preacher and farmer, joined more than 500 protesters who were arrested during six weeks of demonstrations against the dumping in 1982.

The protests failed to stop the landfill — 7,097 truckloads of contaminated soil were buried within 7 feet of groundwater. The contamination gave birth to clusters of cancer cases in the county and took decades to clean up. But they succeeded in birthing a movement. The Rev. Benjamin Chavis, who organized the demonstrations, coined the term “environmental racism” from his jail cell after being arrested with Brown’s father.

More than 40 years later, Brown’s experiment is bolstering a central belief that striving Black communities have enough power and resources to support one another. In 2021, he purchased the Oakley Grove Plantation house where his family was enslaved.

In the past decade, Brown has helped over 75 Black farmers adapt regenerative practices on their land, which in return has helped mitigate climate change impacts, made farming more profitable, and slowed land loss among Black farmers.

“We have to make sure that Warren County residents excel in growth, whether it be environmental, whether it be jobs, whether it be access to food,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/capitalbnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/491977330_1234371988691915_4324299112892745489_n.jpg?fit=2048%2C1142&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:50.078983

Representatives from Entergy, Adopt a Charger and the City of Keo, Arkansas, gathered Oct. 17 to celebrate the installation of a new electric vehicle charger in Keo. The charger, equipped with two charging ports, was unveiled as part of National Drive Electric Month, which promotes the benefits of electric vehicles.

Entergy’s Environmental Initiatives Fund provided funding for the Keo charger. It’s the latest success in a partnership between Entergy Arkansas and the nonprofit Adopt a Charger to install EV charging stations at public locations. The project was also supported by Metroplan, the federally designated Metropolitan Planning Organization that works to determine needs and regional funding priorities for federal transportation.

“At Entergy Arkansas, we’re proud to help communities like Keo prepare for the future of transportation,” said Ventrell Thompson, Entergy Arkansas customer service vice president. “By supporting public charging infrastructure, we’re not only making it easier for Arkansans to choose electric vehicles, we’re also strengthening the network that connects towns, supports local businesses and keeps our state moving forward sustainably.”

Charge Up! Arkansas educates the public about the benefits of EVs and zero-emission tourism in the Natural State.

Since 2021, EIF funding has enabled Adopt a Charger to install EV chargers at numerous Arkansas sites such as the Art & Science Center in Pine Bluff, Beatles Park in Walnut Ridge, Mt. Nebo State Park, Hot Springs Visitor Center, Little Rock Zoo and many others. You can see the full list of chargers here for Arkansas and other states.

The new charger in Keo is compatible with all plug-in vehicles on the market. They can add up to 25 miles of range per hour. That’s a meaningful boost for residents and visitors who spend time dining and shopping in the town, which is near Little Rock.

From home wiring and electric vehicles to renewable energy grids and telecommunications, the metal is necessary for cleaner technologies and more resilient infrastructure.

The U.S. already uses a lot of copper and will need a lot more to keep up with rising clean energy demands. Yet despite its strategic importance, U.S. copper policy is marked by fragmentation and short-term thinking rather than clear direction. This is especially notable as most analysts believe that, both globally and in the U.S., copper demand is likely to outstrip supply within a decade.

Global demand is projected to rise by 22% from around 27 million metric tons (Mt) today to roughly 33 Mt by 2035 and by 37% to 37 Mt by 2050. Meanwhile, the International Energy Association (IEA) projects that as high-grade ore becomes harder to find and aging mines close, global mined copper supply could peak around the late 2020s at a little over 24 Mt, after which output declines noticeably to less than 19 Mt by 2035.

In the U.S., recent federal efforts have sought to accelerate domestic mining, fast-tracking the permitting of projects in the name of “critical mineral independence.” Yet the combination of tariffs, agency budget cuts and uneven inter-agency coordination have undercut U.S. copper producers and processors. The result is a mixed record: an industry being encouraged to produce more to meet demand and achieve supply chain independence, and a country still lacking a long-term copper strategy to manage that demand and the forecast supply gap.

Furthermore, the vast size and diversity of the global copper market also makes it difficult for the U.S. government to significantly influence it. Unlike other metal markets — like the rare earth element market, where the U.S. provided a $400 million investment in the sole U.S. rare earth mining and processing facility, guaranteed purchase agreements and a price floor for its key product — there are no easy policy wins applicable to copper. Influencing the copper market will require a longer term and more strategic approach.

U.S. Copper Production and Demand

The U.S. produces 850,000 tons of refined copper from its own mines, plus an additional 870,000 tons in copper scrap from recycling (both post-consumer scrap and new scrap recovered from fabricating operations), but to meet the country’s needs of about 2.5 million tons, it imports an additional 810,000 tons of refined copper. That leaves a 30% gap. While these figures represent U.S. copper consumption, copper demand is likely even higher because the U.S. also imports manufactured goods containing copper that aren’t counted in consumption figures.

This domestic supply gap leaves the U.S. vulnerable to external shocks and export controls. Without significant U.S. government intervention, the 30% supply gap will likely grow as U.S. copper ore grades decline and demand from clean energy increases.

One potential bright spot is the proposed Resolution Copper Mine in Arizona, a joint venture between mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP, which could, if permitted, supply nearly a quarter of the U.S.’s current mined production. However, without associated refining capacity, the U.S. will continue to remain dependent on refined copper imports.

Forecasting U.S. Demand

The demand for copper is expected to increase rapidly from grid modernization, more electric vehicles, increased renewable energy sources needed to power everyday lives, and from the increase in artificial intelligence which is spurring the rise of high energy consuming data centers.

To support grid modernization and renewables integration, the U.S. will likely need to build an estimated 5,000 miles of new transmission line annually in the coming decades. That figure, based on an analysis from the Department of Energy’s 2024 National Transmission Planning Study, would require hundreds of thousands of additional tons of copper per year, further pressuring the supply base.

Over the last decade, electric vehicle growth in the U.S. has gone from almost negligible to a material source of copper demand. In 2024, 1.6 million electric cars were sold in the U.S., with the sales share growing to more than 10%. The increased copper in the car itself (EVs require up to four times as much copper as a gasoline-powered car), plus the associated charging infrastructure has likely added several hundred thousand tons per year to U.S. copper demand.

According to the IEA, the total amount of new power generation capacity from renewable sources, like solar and wind, in the U.S. rose 40% from 2023 to 2024, mainly reflecting rapid increases in solar PV. Solar power systems contain approximately 5.5 tons of copper per megawatt, with copper in the heat exchangers of solar units as well as in the wiring and cabling that transmits the electricity in photovoltaic cells. The IEA expects stable growth in U.S. renewable capacity in 2025, with slightly lower solar PV expansion and wind capacity from projects that qualified for tax credits before the current administration’s policy changes.

Copper demand tied to AI and data infrastructure is rising fast, too. Data centers and the power and cooling infrastructure that they use all contain substantial copper content in cables, transformers and power delivery systems. In the past two years, construction of data centers has doubled in the U.S as major U.S. tech companies try and stay ahead of the AI-driven demand.

Government Tactics Lack Strategy

The U.S. government is acting with a sense of urgency to reduce the domestic copper supply gap. It recognizes its dependence on imported refined copper coupled with falling U.S. copper ore grades could prove disastrous for a copper-hungry U.S. economy.

Government officials would no doubt argue that they are doing more to advance the interests of copper than any previous U.S. administration and they may be right. For example, copper was recently added to the U.S. Critical Minerals list, making it potentially eligible for federal grants, research funding and streamlined permitting. While it’s not unhelpful to have copper on the list, it’s among 59 other minerals including, aluminum, lead and metallurgical coal, competing for government attention and resources. Other actions have negative or mixed impacts on the U.S. copper supply:

Trade and Tariffs

The signature economic tool used by the Trump administration to date has been tariffs. In August, the administration imposed tariffs of up to 50% on several categories of semi-finished copper imports including copper pipes, wires, rods, sheets and tubes. While these tariffs are likely to increase costs for many downstream industries, the government’s broader tariff regime will also raise costs for mining equipment, spare parts and refining machinery, resulting in higher operating costs for U.S. producers that rely on imported specialized machinery.

Major U.S. copper markets — including China and the EU — have responded to U.S. tariffs with counter-tariffs. This will likely dampen U.S. exports and create uncertainty for global contracts.

Tariff threats and countermeasures have also fueled swings in copper prices, complicating planning and financing for long-term projects. On July 8, President Donald Trump announced, “I believe the tariff on copper, we’re going to make it 50%.” That caused copper futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to surge 13% as the markets widely assumed that imported refined copper would be targeted. On July 30, when the White House clarified that the tariffs would be on semi-finished copper products, and not refined copper as expected, copper futures contracts fell 19% in the biggest intraday fall on record.

Lastly, instead of shielding U.S. copper, tariffs may make it less competitive. Producers have faced squeezed margins, while downstream industries have been forced to pay more for wiring and other copper products.

Institutional Capacity and Permitting Challenges

Long‑term copper supply depends not just on mines but on the institutions that enable them. Budget cuts at agencies like the U.S. Forest Service (34%), Bureau of Land Management (36%) and Environmental Protection Agency (54%) will slow permitting and environmental review. Delays, uncertainty and regulatory risk discourage investment.

In addition, fast-tracking mine permitting, a signature mining policy from the Trump administration, has a high potential to backfire. Rushed environmental reviews are more likely to be challenged in court, which can result in years of litigation. Unstable rules also discourage the long-term investment that mining requires; a mine approved under one administration may face reversal under the next, scaring off capital.

Lastly, without reforming downstream processing, further instability in the U.S. copper market is likely. New mining alone doesn’t produce finished copper products; refining and smelting capability must keep pace. In October, Richard Holtum, CEO of the commodity trader Trafigura, caused a minor stir when he said: “Mining is not critical, refining and smelting is critical … If you don’t have it in your country, then you are at the mercy of someone that does and their ability to turn on or off that smelting capacity.”

Internal Coordination

Perhaps the most fundamental problem is the absence of a coherent U.S. copper strategy. Unlike China, which coordinates mining, refining, recycling and trade under a unified framework, the U.S. remains fragmented.

There is no lead agency, with responsibility for copper split across the departments of the Interior, Energy and Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency, and in certain circumstances, the State Department, with little coordination. The current administration has set up the National Energy Dominance Council, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, that could potentially act as a government coordinating body across all aspects of domestic energy, including critical minerals, but in practice, the council seems to be a presidential advisory body rather than a coordinating one that develops coherent and cohesive strategy.

Current U.S. policies give the impression of being reactive rather than proactive, typically driven by short-term trade disputes rather than a long-term vision for copper’s role in the energy transition. This means that with no clear roadmap, companies are hesitating to invest in new smelters, recycling facilities, or long-term exploration.

Moving Toward a Coherent U.S. Copper Strategy

To ensure that copper is available, affordable and resilient to shock, the U.S. should adopt a forward-looking, balanced approach that includes:

1) Strengthening Recycling and Circular Systems

Recycling is a central piece of any sustainable copper strategy — if properly leveraged. In the U.S., around 870,000 tons of copper scrap was collected in 2024, a figure that technically constitutes approximately one-third of the domestic copper supply. However, that figure does not show that over half of all copper scrap produced in the U.S. is exported for processing, much of it to China. This not only increases the U.S. reliance on China for arguably one of its most critical minerals, but it also forfeits an opportunity to close the copper circular economy loop.

While recycled copper is not without its sustainability challenges, compared to primary copper (mined ore), secondary copper requires up requires up to 85% less energy to produce. As a result, many consumers who are conscious of their carbon footprint are pushing to acquire the same relatively limited supply of recycled copper. The mining company BHP estimates that, as demand for primary copper begins to outstrip supply, collection and process of scrap will increase to around 40% by 2035 and reach around a half of total copper consumption by 2050.

Regions like the EU and Japan have more advanced circular copper approaches, better scrap collection systems and stronger secondary refining capacity giving them an edge in supply security. If the U.S. builds out modern recycling infrastructure, incentivizes scrap collection and processing through grants, regulatory support and procurement incentives, and retains more copper scrap onshore, it can reduce both reliance on imports and carbon footprint, while creating jobs in manufacturing and clean industry.

2) Building Domestic Refining and Smelting Capacity

The U.S. has just two operating primary smelters; and a third that hasn’t been permanently closed, but it’s not currently in operation. Both operating smelters are running at near-full capacity so, if new copper mines are developed in the U.S., new smelters will need to be built to receive their copper concentrate. Modern copper smelters not only cost billions to build but their running costs, in large part due to their energy intensity and the stringent environment regulations they must abide by, are also significant. Rather than providing incentives and public–private partnerships (e.g., subsidies, tax credits) to support the establishment of state-of-the-art, low-emission smelters and electro refineries, the Trump administration has reversed a Biden-era air pollution rule, in the name of reducing regulatory burdens, that had imposed stricter limits on emissions from the U.S.’s two copper smelters.

3) Investing in Scientific and Institutional Capacity

The funding cuts at the agencies that provide environmental baseline studies and regulatory capacity should, at the very least, be reversed, if not increased. Those agencies were already generally considered to be understaffed, a situation that contributed to permitting delays. If the current administration wants to increase domestic mining, the agencies that oversee domestic mining need to be commensurately increased.

4) Streamlining but Stabilizing Permitting

According to the National Mining Association (NMA), “a typical mining project loses more than one-third of its value, as a result of bureaucratic delays in receiving the numerous permits needed to begin production.” The NMA also states that in peer mining countries like Canada and Australia that have quicker permitting processes, the timeline for the government to respond is more clearly outlined, the permitting agency leading the process is clearly identified from the outset, and the responsibility for preparing a well-structured environmental review is given to the mining company, not the government. Reforming these areas of the permitting process would help to reduce uncertainty and delay, however, it is critical that high environmental and social safeguards remain in place, reducing the risk that new mines become litigation bottlenecks.

5) Coordinating a National Critical Minerals Framework

The National Energy Dominance Council could, if empowered to do so, align trade, research and development, industrial policy and supply chain strategy in a coherent policy approach that would boost U.S. copper production. However, the council’s focus is spread thinly between oil, gas, nuclear, the electrical grid, coal and hard rock mining. Reinstating the U.S. Bureau of Mines (closed since 1996) or developing a new, hard rock mine-focused coordinating body would bring in-house many of the functions currently carried out by a myriad of overlapping oversight agencies, would help bring certainty to investors and would incentivize further mineral exploration in the U.S.

Bridging the Copper Supply and Demand Gap

Copper sits at the heart of America’s clean energy, defense and digital economies. The challenge is not merely to extract more but to orchestrate a supply system — mining, processing, recycling and regulation — that is resilient, efficient and forward-looking. With strategic planning and investment, the U.S. can bridge the looming copper gap and ensure that this essential metal powers its economic future.",https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/1222x722/s3/2025-12/copper-wiring_0.jpg?VersionId=RAlikbPT__0861O0Dq6P12duJAOfm1X3&h=b0dce8b1&itok=Edu-MD1Q,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:04.660533

In 2025, those forces aligned in a way that felt both grounded and forward-looking. It was a year when Detroit clarified where it has been and where it is determined to go.

If the past decade was about revival, 2025 was about direction — shaped by neighborhoods, artists, educators, innovators, designers, and everyday Detroiters working toward a shared future.

Here, Detroitisit takes a look back at some of the people, projects, and ideas that shaped our stories this year, and the momentum they’ve created for what comes next.

How neighborhoods, institutions, and creators defined Detroit’s direction this year.

Many of this year’s most impactful stories came from Detroit’s neighborhoods, where local leadership continues to guide change from the inside out.

In Brightmoor, community organizers addressed long-standing challenges with practical, creative solutions — from youth programs to neighborhood beautification. Eliza Howell Park, a long-cherished but often overlooked green space, experienced renewed energy through ecological restoration and community-driven programming. Both examples reinforced a central idea: Detroit’s transformation works best when it is shaped by the people who live in these spaces every day.

Even Detroit’s alleys — once ignored or underused — gained new purpose. Through art, design, and community involvement, they evolved into gathering spaces and creative corridors. These small-scale interventions made a big impact, proving that meaningful change does not always require large projects. Sometimes it starts at the edges.

On a larger scale, 2025 brought major progress to civic and infrastructure projects that will influence Detroit for generations.

The riverfront’s continued evolution, including the development of the Ralph C. Wilson Jr. Centennial Park, reflected Detroit’s commitment to ecological design and public accessibility. With native plants, water features, and open green space, the riverfront is becoming one of the city’s most significant examples of sustainable public development.

Mobility innovation also gained momentum. Discussions about autonomous vehicle corridors, transportation technology, and multimodal systems signaled Detroit’s intention to link its historic role in transportation with a more modern, inclusive vision. As Tony Geara, Deputy Chief of Mobility Innovation for Detroit emphasized, mobility is not only about infrastructure — it’s about improving quality of life.

Culturally, 2025 was a dynamic and energizing year.

The revival of Detroit’s Chinatown stands out as a meaningful effort in cultural visibility and placemaking. Its resurgence is about more than restoring a physical district — it’s about reclaiming heritage and community identity.

Inside museums and creative institutions, new leadership and initiatives brought fresh energy. Cranbrook Academy of Art welcomed an interim director who introduced new ideas into the region’s artistic landscape.

Detroit also strengthened its role in the national art economy. UOVO’s acquisition of ArtPack signaled the city’s emerging position as a key center for art handling, logistics, and creative business. And the Ford Piquette Plant continued its stewardship of Detroit’s manufacturing history, reminding residents that the city’s past still informs its future.

Development stories in 2025 emphasized a shift toward intentionality.

“Building With Heart in Detroit” showcased Jonathan Hartzell’s work, who prioritizes community partnerships, local talent, and sustainable practices.

Gardner White’s return to Detroit highlighted how established companies can reinvest in the city in ways that support artists, makers, and local ecosystems.

Education and youth development were also central themes. Articles such as “Creating Opportunities for the Next Generation” and “A Foundation Championing Detroit’s Next Generation” showed how mentorship, access, and education continue to shape Detroit’s long-term future.

Throughout these stories, one idea stayed constant: successful investment happens when people are the focus.

Detroit’s commitment to sustainability grew stronger in 2025.

Climate-resilient parks, naturalized landscapes, stormwater-smart design, and efforts to rethink vacant land all contributed to a deeper conversation about the city’s environmental future. “Redefining Sustainability in Detroit” emphasized that sustainability is not simply a trend — it’s a long-term approach to building smarter, healthier, and more equitable communities.

Everything from fertilizer use to carbon emissions to green space access is becoming part of Detroit’s planning vocabulary, marking a shift toward strategies that benefit residents today and protect generations ahead.

Meawhile Detroit’s food scene continued to evolve, reflecting broader cultural shifts. “2025 Detroit Dining Trends” showed how chefs are embracing hyper-local sourcing, storytelling through cuisine, and more communal forms of dining. These trends align with Detroit’s broader pattern of creativity, connection, and sense of place.

Detroitisit also held its 4th Annual Sustainable Urban Design Summit, gathering architects, planners, policymakers, and designers at Newlab inside the Michigan Central Innovation District to explore how cities can grow more equitably and sustainably. The full-day event reflected both urgency and optimism, underscoring Detroit’s role not just as a participant in the future of urban design, but as a leader shaping it.

Across all of these stories — from neighborhood revitalization to cultural programming, from mobility innovation to environmental design — one message defined Detroit in 2025: resilience here is active. It is shared. It is intentional.

As Detroit enters 2026, it does so with the momentum of thousands of people working toward a future grounded in possibility, equity, and imagination. Reinvention remains part of Detroit’s identity — and it will be fun to see where that takes us.",https://detroitisit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-11-at-8.47.01-AM.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 10:02:10.843614

The City of Fairfax is one of 19 Virginia localities participating in the statewide Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy financing program. C-PACE financing helps property owners overcome financial barriers that discourage investment in energy and water conservation projects.

C-PACE enables owners of commercial, industrial, nonprofit and multifamily properties (with five or more units) to access long-term, fixed-rate financing for energy efficiency, renewable energy, water conservation, and resiliency improvements. Building improvements financed with C-PACE can be completed with no upfront, out-of-pocket cost and can generate positive cash flow upon completion.

C-PACE projects are financed by private lenders, including specialized C-PACE capital providers and community and regional banking institutions. The financing is repaid through a special assessment on the property tax bill, typically over a term that matches the useful life of the improvements — up to 30 years — and can be transferred to the new owner if the property is sold.

Administered by the Virginia PACE Authority in partnership with Virginia Energy, the program streamlines financing and reduces administrative burden for localities.

Benefits for Property Owners:

No money out of pocket: 100% financing includes hard and soft costs

Reduces capital expenditure budget; upgrades paid through operating savings

Eligible measures cover broad capital and facility improvement needs

Extends building lifespan while improving comfort.

Long-term, fixed interest rate financing (up to 35 years) results in lower annual payments.

Typically cash flow positive within the first year

Property owners may pass through C-PACE assessment to tenants, if allowed by lease.

Moreover, as a majority of biofuels are imported, the EU wouldn't gain in autonomy, another objective of the shift to electric vehicles.
European carmakers -- BMW, Mercedes, Renault, Stellantis and VW -- are not always on the same page even if they all want the rules to be relaxed.","While Europe's embattled auto industry and its backers have lobbied hard for Brussels to relax the ban, they are divided on exactly what measures to take.

Why the 2035 target date?

In 2023, despite the reluctance of Germany, the commission announced a ban on sales of new vehicles powered by internal combustion engines from 2035. Hybrids that use a combination of combustion engines and battery power are also included.

The ban is a key measure to help attain the EU's target of carbon neutrality by 2050.

The date is important as vehicles spend an average of 15 years on the road in the EU and thus would be expected to have largely stopped spewing planet-warming emissions by around 2050.

The 2023 announcement included a provision for a review in 2026 but, under pressure from carmakers and governments, the commission pushed forward announcing proposed adjustments to the end of 2025.

The proposals will go to the European Parliament for review.

What adjustments are possible?

For those against the ban, it's no longer just a question of shifting the 2035 date, but of relaxing certain provisions.

Carmakers would like to see continued sales authorised for hybrids with rechargeable batteries or those equipped with range extenders (small combustion engines which recharge the battery instead of powering the wheels).

Germany supports this option as do eastern European nations where German carmakers have set up factories.

The ACEA association of European carmakers doesn't criticise the goal of electrification, but it said ""the 2035 CO2 targets for cars and vans are no longer realistic"".

Another possible means to add some flexibility would be boosting the use of alternative fuels such as those derived from agricultural crops and waste products.

Italy supports this option.

But environmental groups are opposed to any massive turn to crop-based biofuels as it would likely boost the use of pesticides and aggravate soil depletion, and they are also sceptical about what emissions reductions can actually be achieved.

Moreover, as a majority of biofuels are imported, the EU wouldn't gain in autonomy, another objective of the shift to electric vehicles.

Carmakers out of alignment?

European carmakers -- BMW, Mercedes, Renault, Stellantis and VW -- are not always on the same page even if they all want the rules to be relaxed.

This is principally due to their varying progress in shifting to electric models.

The industry that has grown up around the electric car sector -- such as battery manufacturers, recharge stations and electricity companies -- wants to keep the 2035 target with no adjustments.

""Rolling back these objectives would undermine the EU’s energy sovereignty, industrial leadership, and climate credibility,"" said the UFE, a trade group for French electricity industry firms.

France, along with Spain and the Nordic countries, has long called for keeping to the trajectory to shift to electric vehicles in order to not harm firms that have made investments in the transition.

Paris has indicated it is open to some flexibility on the condition of local content being favoured, which pleases suppliers which have also come under intense pressure from cheaper Chinese competition.

Is there a risk in backsliding?

Yes, according to experts.

""What is considered a short-term advantage may not be one in the long term,"" said Jean-Philippe Hermine at the IDDRI think tank that focuses on the transition in the transport sector.

Bernard Jullien, an economist at the University of Bordeaux, said keeping several different technologies imposes extra costs for companies.

It can also create uncertainty for them if consumers adopt a wait-and-see attitude, he added.

""Between China and its electric vehicles and the oil that Saudi Arabia and the United States wants to sell us, is the right choice to stick with our old technology?"" asked Diane Strauss, head of the French office of T&E, an advocacy group for clean transport and energy.

Reddit users in the r/electricvehicles community shared why leveling up to an EV was their best decision yet.","Residents at several apartment complexes near metro Detroit will soon have access to electric vehicle charging stations.

As Michigan Live reported, it's all thanks to a $1.84 million grant announced by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.

The grant will cover 201 charging stations installed at 31 complexes in the Detroit suburbs of Taylor, Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Dearborn Heights, and Southfield. Several apartments in Kalamazoo, Flint, and Lansing will also receive chargers.

The state's Clean Fuel and Charging Infrastructure Program funded the grants, which ""range from roughly $20,000 to $98,000 per site for installing two to 10 Level 2 chargers,"" per Michigan Live.

Since these chargers require around four to eight hours to fully charge an EV battery, they are reserved for overnight use.

Another $5 million in grants will become available for charging projects at apartments, with funds distributed at $300,000 per site.

Governor Gretchen Whitmer's MI Healthy Climate Plan is behind the push to install EV chargers at multifamily properties, and by 2030, the goal is to deploy 100,000 chargers and get 2 million electric vehicles on the road.

While the EV market continues to grow, sales have slowed in recent years, likely due to a combination of inflation, tariffs, and expiring federal tax credits, per Electrek.

However, many states, cities, and utilities continue to offer rebates for purchasing an EV, which you can view on the Department of Energy's website. In addition, federal tax credits for EV chargers are still available, provided you install equipment before June 30.

By switching to an electric vehicle, you'll save around 50% on maintenance and up to $1,100 on gas per year, according to Coltura.

EVs are also much better for the environment than gas-powered vehicles since they don't produce tailpipe pollution, which has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases by the World Heart Federation.

Meanwhile, fumes from conventional cars trap heat in the atmosphere, driving up global temperatures and fueling extreme weather.

Both your wallet and the planet win by ditching gas-powered cars for electric ones, and if you have a home charger, you'll save time and money on ""fueling up."" Qmerit can help you find the right charger for your needs.

Installing a home solar panel system can cut your charging costs even further, and TCD's Solar Explorer can connect you with qualified installers and save you up to $10,000 on associated costs.

Reddit users in the r/electricvehicles community shared why leveling up to an EV was their best decision yet.

""I spent more on my EV than on any other car I ever bought but save so much on fuel and maintenance that the difference pays my loan,"" one user said.

Great British Energy (GBE) has launched the £1 billion Energy Engineered in the UK (EEUK) programme, designed to mobilise public and private investment, unlock critical manufacturing capacity and create thousands of skilled jobs.

As part of the programme, GBE is opening its £300 million Supply Chain Fund: Offshore Wind & Networks, aimed at tackling urgent bottlenecks in essential components for the energy transition. These include blades, turbines, transmission cables and converter stations, all crucial for offshore wind deployment and grid development.

According to GBE, the fund will help expand domestic manufacturing capacity and ensure the UK remains a leading force in offshore wind and electricity network innovation. The initiative forms a central pillar of the UK Government’s modern Industrial Strategy, which outlines a ten-year plan to stimulate investment, create high-quality employment and strengthen Britain’s competitiveness as a hub for clean energy technologies.

GBE will collaborate with key partners — the National Wealth Fund, the Scottish National Infrastructure Bank and The Crown Estate — to unlock financing for large-scale manufacturing projects across the country.

In parallel, the organisation is establishing a Deepwater Wind Commercialisation Programme in partnership with FLOWEX, bringing together industry leaders to advance the next generation of deepwater offshore wind and capture its industrial opportunities.

GBE says the Energy Engineered in the UK initiative will deliver:

Increased high-value manufacturing capacity

Skilled, well-paid jobs across the country

A more resilient supply chain for future low-carbon technologies

GBE CEO Dan McGrail said the programme represents a significant investment in British industry. “Great British Energy is investing in British industry, we are helping to create jobs, driving innovation, and ensuring clean energy infrastructure is built here in the UK. This programme is about more than funding; it will help overcome the current challenges and ensure the benefits of a world-class supply chain are felt in communities across the country.”

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said the initiative supports the government’s ambition to build the UK’s clean energy future domestically. “We want our clean energy future to be built here in Britain as part of our modern Industrial Strategy”, he said.",https://www.review-energy.com/fileuploads/news/review-energy-noticias-copia-217654507521.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:14.773453

Texas Pacific sees cooling the facilities’ equipment as a possible opportunity to generate sales for the treated water.","Texas is about to deploy a potential solution to the oil industry’s toxic wastewater problem — but it’s a move that carries environmental risks of its own.

State regulators are working to issue permits that would let four companies, including major landowner Texas Pacific Land Corp. and pipeline operator NGL Energy Partners LP, release treated wastewater from the Permian Basin into the Pecos River near New Mexico, regulatory filings show. At least one could be granted as soon as the first quarter of 2026, according to Texas Pacific.

Oil and gas wells in the Permian, the largest US shale basin, generate 21 million barrels per day of water laden with salt, chemicals and heavy metals. Drillers have been disposing of most of that fluid by pumping it back underground, a practice that has triggered earthquakes and leaks.

The proposed projects would be the first in a new generation of Permian treatment plants that would clean the industry’s wastewater, allowing it to be jettisoned above – rather than below – the ground. If successful, they could reduce underground disposal and provide water to irrigate crops and cool data-center equipment.

Yet cleaning up the water would raise costs for producers grappling with low crude prices, dealing a blow to a basin that’s crucial to President Donald Trump’s goal of energy dominance. And the prospect of the oil and gas industry discharging wastewater into Texas rivers, even after treatment, is alarming environmentalists. Regulators have yet to prove such releases are safe amid growing concern about their effects on human health and ecosystems.

“It’s really dangerous,” said Virginia Palacios, executive director at the Texas government watchdog Commission Shift. She doubts whether oil companies and state regulators can be trusted to fix an environmental liability they created in the first place.

“The main problem has been that the industry is always looking for shortcuts,” she said.

A Bloomberg News investigation in September found that Texas allowed oil and gas companies to increase the volume of wastewater pumped into shallow underground reservoirs, even though state regulators were warned by their own staff that the fluid could leak to the surface from old wells. Regulators placed pressure limits on wastewater disposal and are reviewing a handful of pilot projects that aim to find new outlets for treated fluid, including some run by Texas Pacific.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said in an emailed response to questions that it won’t allow treatment plants to discharge wastewater that is dangerous to aquatic life, violates state water quality standards, endangers drinking supplies or threatens human health. The agency said it’s monitoring water quality at four locations on the Upper Pecos River and two sites on the river’s Red Bluff Reservoir.

At least two of the applications for river discharge under review by the commission, known as TCEQ, are on track to move forward to a stage when the draft permits are available for public viewing and anyone with concerns can call for a hearing, filings show.

Shale producers blast water, sand and chemicals into wells to break apart rock and allow oil to flow — a process known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. With wastewater disposal volumes expected to grow almost 40% over the next decade, the Permian’s biggest operators want to find alternatives to pumping it underground.

One option is to reuse the wastewater for fracking. But since salt-laden water occurs naturally in shale formations, more fluid comes out of a well than goes in. That means that more water is produced than can be used again in new frack jobs, limiting the industry’s ability to use recycling as a long term solution.

Water is becoming such a serious challenge for the Permian, which produces more oil than any OPEC member aside from Saudi Arabia, that operators will spend $101.3 billion managing it through 2030, according to Bluefield Research, a data and analytics provider. Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law in June providing $20 billion for water infrastructure in the state, funds that could be used partly for treatment projects proposed by the oil and gas industry.

The biggest hurdle to scaling up water treatment is cost. Estimates for cleaning wastewater vary widely because projects are still early stage, but some are in the range of $2 or $3 per barrel of water, mainly due to the large amount of energy needed. That’s multiples higher than the 65 cents to $1.50 a barrel expense of injecting underground, according to Bluefield.

Texas Pacific, founded during the Wild West Era of the late 19th century, sees a business opportunity. It could receive a permit to release cleaned-up wastewater into rivers and streams as soon as the first quarter of next year, Robert Crain, executive vice president of the company’s water division, said in an interview.

The 10,000 barrel-a-day pilot project may only treat 0.05% of the basin’s water, but executives believe it could solve a huge environmental problem and become a new revenue source once the technology is deployed at greater scale.

Wastewater, known as produced water, is as much as five times saltier than the ocean. As such, Texas Pacific envisions a handful of intensive early steps such as freezing it and using membranes to reduce salinity. Then the fluid will be put through reverse osmosis and ultimately sanitized with a chemical agent or an ultraviolet light.

On three occasions, Texas Pacific passed a five-day test to show organisms can reproduce in its cleaned-up water and a seven-day test to demonstrate that aquatic life can grow, Crain said.

“Everybody wants to be scared of what’s in produced water. It is safe to drink,” Crain said of the treated water, adding that he has done so himself. In any case, “we’re a long way away from this water going directly back into drinking-water systems.”

Texas Pacific said that while it welcomes scrutiny of its water treatment and reuse projects, its goal is to maintain standards far above existing protocols.

“This is the complete oppositive of a shortcut — we are investing significant time and resources into research, testing and fabrication where we could have otherwise chosen to do nothing,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email.

Other companies are also pursuing wastewater treatment ventures. Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips and Coterra Energy Inc. are working with Aris Water Solutions Inc. on a project to test several new technologies to lower the salt content of wastewater, including using membranes and thermal distillation, or separating impurities from water using heat. Exxon plans to have a fully operational treatment facility by the end of next year as part of its goal to “deliver sustainable water solutions” for the Permian, according to a spokesman.

Chevron wants to turn a “waste product into a resource,” said Brittany Cheben, the company’s Permian water strategy manager. “Our aim is to preserve fresh water for human use by repurposing this water for industrial applications, non-food agriculture, or municipal uses like golf courses.”

As part of a project backed by shale giant EOG Resources Inc., Tetra Technologies Inc. is testing the limits of membranes used to remove salts from Permian wastewater at its lab near Houston. The goal is to make them more durable so they can be used for a longer time before needing to be replaced, reducing costs.

“Produced water is going to be a problem for many, many years,” Tetra Chief Executive Officer Brady Murphy said in an interview. “These types of solutions have to be brought to the market. And they will.”

Regardless of what method companies use to filter the water, they’ll still have to dispose of what’s left over. That likely means shooting it back underground using a yet-to-be-determined volume of water. Some of the waste could also be mined for valuable minerals like lithium.

Along with proposals to pump treated wastewater into rivers and streams, companies are testing out discharge onto land.

Data center developers, who are eyeing West Texas amid the artificial-intelligence boom, are potential customers for oil wastewater. Texas Pacific sees cooling the facilities’ equipment as a possible opportunity to generate sales for the treated water.

Farmers may also be buyers. A handful of pilot projects are underway to spread small amounts of cleaned-up wastewater on test plots in West Texas, where crops such as alfalfa and cotton are grown.

Jeremy Louder, a fourth-generation farmer near Midland, Texas, believes this could help revive agriculture in the water-starved region. Conditions are so dry that he grows wheat to prevent runoff and erosion, preserving what little water he has for his sorghum crop.

Holding a head of wheat as he looked out across his 13,000 acre (5,261-hectare) ranch, Louder pointed to a cluster of water tanks and wastewater disposal equipment near Exxon’s operations about a mile away. The way he sees it, cleaned-up water could allow for year-round growing.

“If there was a plant over here, we would grow one summer crop, one winter crop, and then we would have a permanent grass,” Louder said. “That water would be utilized all the time. We could push it further by double-cropping if we had to. We’ve got the land available.”

Still, farmers are unlikely to have the cash to pay for large volumes of cleaned-up water. Groundwater, though dwindling, is essentially free.

Another challenge for companies pursuing wastewater treatment is convincing the public that the fluid has been filtered and sanitized enough to be safe. Despite the industry’s insistence that technology can turn toxic waste into clean — even drinkable — water, Ira Yates has doubts.

Yates, a descendant of a prominent oil dynasty and president of the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Pecos River, supports pilot projects to test treated wastewater on land. But he thinks it’s way too early to discharge it into the state’s rivers. The Pecos River is a delicate and complex ecosystem that has been a crucial source of water in arid West Texas for hundreds of years, Yates said.

“There’s still a reasonable doubt,” he said, “that maybe there’s something in the water that we’re not seeing.”

Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said Wisconsin experienced a 29 percent cut to state funding over the period.
The report found state funding for environmental agencies declined by the largest share in Mississippi, South Dakota and Connecticut.
As state funding has dropped, so too has funding for the EPA.","A new report finds Wisconsin saw one of the nation’s largest share of funding cuts to environmental agencies in the last 15 years.

The findings come as President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts could further hinder work to address air, land and water pollution.

The report released Wednesday by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found nearly two-thirds of states have cut staffing and more than half have reduced funding for environmental agencies since 2010. Wisconsin was among the top 10 states in the nation for these cuts.

The environmental watchdog group argued states were already struggling to protect against pollution before Trump proposed a nearly 55 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2026 budget, which would reduce federal funding for states.

Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said Wisconsin experienced a 29 percent cut to state funding over the period. Funding for pollution control programs at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources dropped from $121 million in 2010 to $85 million last year when adjusted for inflation, according to the report.

“That means there are fewer people and fewer resources to do the really important job of making sure that companies follow the law, that permits are protective and that communities are safe from industrial pollution,” Duggan said.

Wisconsin had the 10th largest percentage decline in state funding. The report found state funding for environmental agencies declined by the largest share in Mississippi, South Dakota and Connecticut.

The report’s findings are based on data provided by the DNR that include money spent on environmental remediation, water quality improvement and air management. The data excluded funding under the state’s clean water and safe drinking water loan programs.

As state funding has dropped, so too has funding for the EPA. Funding for the federal agency has declined 40 percent in the past 15 years when adjusted for inflation, the report said. The agency’s funding supports states as they enforce environmental laws that include the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.

Under Trump’s proposed cuts to EPA, states stand to lose around $2.5 billion for revolving loan funds for water upgrades. Trump’s budget would also cut more than $1 billion in federal grants that help states manage local air quality, prevent water pollution and clean up contaminated sites.

A DNR spokesperson said the agency would not be able to assume all the work that’s currently funded by the federal government if its funding is significantly reduced as proposed under Trump’s budget.

Republicans in the U.S.House have proposed $7 billion in funding for EPA or a 23 percent cut in the agency’s budget. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed $8.6 billion in funding for EPA — a 5 percent reduction. When Congress ended the government shutdown in November, lawmakers postponed a vote on 2026 funding levels for the agency and the rest of the government until the end of January.

In a Nov. 13 meeting, DNR Secretary Karen Hyun said the agency is monitoring federal funding impacts.

“We continue to work really hard to mitigate the impacts at the DNR,” Hyun said. “We’re about 30 percent federally funded, so we do have strong partnerships in terms of funding and technical assistance and science with different federal agencies.”

Amid funding cuts, the report notes EPA’s workforce also shrank by 18 percent or more than 3,100 full-time positions in the last 15 years. Those figures don’t include thousands of staff who were fired or left the agency this year. An EPA spokesperson said the agency is confident it has the resources to protect human health and the environment.

“Likewise, at the Trump EPA we understand that states know states best, and we are working alongside state, tribal, and local authorities to ensure clean land, air, and water for all residents,” an EPA spokesperson said.

As for states, the report said they eliminated 3,725 positions in pollution control or related environmental programs in the last 15 years.

Under the current state budget, the DNR is down 500 positions since the beginning of the 2003-05 biennium when it had nearly 2,975 positions, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The DNR lost 256 positions in budgets approved by Democratic former Gov. Jim Doyle and around 230 positions in budgets approved by Republican former Gov. Scott Walker.

Duggan called on state lawmakers to reverse the trend of cutting state pollution control programs. Top GOP leaders and Republican chairs of the Legislature’s budget-writing committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

The report from the Environmental Integrity Project evaluated staffing and changes in operating budgets at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality and comparable agencies in other states. From 2010 through 2024, the numbers show the agency’s personnel count decreased 24% with 222 positions eliminated from the agency. The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department.

“These cuts increase the risk that residents will face higher levels of pollution, especially if the EPA lacks the funding and capacity to do its job,” Environmental Integrity Project executive director Jen Duggan said Wednesday during a news conference for the report’s release.

“In Louisiana, we feel them deeply,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade who also took part in the news conference.

The report focused on the Department of Environmental Quality’s operating budget, or the money it spends to handle day-to-day tasks such as paying employees, maintaining facilities, lab analysis and grants to local governments. Large loans and federal grants, which are considered as capital costs, were excluded from the analysis where possible to avoid outliers because they vary widely from year to year and “do not measure a state’s capacity” to limit pollution, according to the report’s methodology.

The staffing cuts at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality are “among the most of any state,” according to the report. Other standouts included Mississippi, which reduced its environmental agency funding 71% from 2010 to 2024.

On the other end of the spectrum is California, which increased its environmental operating budget by 364% over the same 14 years.

At the federal level, the Trump administration has said it intends to bring the EPA’s employee count down to levels last seen during the Reagan era, when the agency had between 11,000 and 14,000 people of staff, NPR reported. It began Trump’s second term with about 15,000 employees.

The majority of environmental agency staffing cuts in Louisiana happened during Bobby Jindal’s terms as governor from 2008-16. The Department of Environmental Quality has not seen significant hiring or funding boosts dating back to Edwin Edwards’ fourth term as governor from 1992-96.

The agency’s boldest policy moves came after Gov. Buddy Roemer took office in 1988. He placed environmental scientist Paul Templet in charge of Environmental Quality, and the administration tied industrial incentives to benchmarks for reducing pollution. Since Roemer lost his reelection bid in 1991, governors who have succeeded him have, to varying degrees, urged cooperation with industry.

The Environmental Integrity Project report points out cuts in Department of Environmental Quality staff and funding come as Louisiana sees a boom in industrial investment. The number of facilities seeking air pollution control permits from the state rose 29% from 2016-24, with 1,906 applications last year according to the report’s analysis of public records.

A spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality responded to the report in a statement, saying the department meets all federal grant requirements and performance expectations while prioritizing “efficiency” and remaining “fully committed” to environmental protection.

The department has implemented an expedited permitting program to make up for its staffing shortages, allowing applicants to pay for agency staff members’ overtime as they work on the approval process.

Rolfes cites issues with this process in the report, saying it creates a conflict of interest.

“When you cut the resources of the agencies, you further depend on the companies themselves as the source of payment for permit writers — and that is an inherent conflict,” Rolfes wrote in the report. “When you have the company paying your overtime, you are just not going to ask the questions and scrutinize it the way you would if your salaries were being paid by the public.”

The analysis also identified Louisiana as having the highest amount of toxic air emissions per square mile of any state in the country. Staffing shortages also play a role in delayed response time to pollution issues, according to the report.

In 2019, the Environmental Integrity Project report counted only 10 LDEQ employees who handled all air enforcement actions at more than 500 major industrial facilities and hundreds more smaller locations.

Data centers are not going away; they are the backbone of the growing digital economy.
The reality is, data centers are foundational to how we live in the world today, and more so in the future.","Colorado is in the middle of a data center boom. You may or may not notice it as you travel along the Front Range, but the world’s digital infrastructure is rapidly taking root here.

Warehouses full of hyper-efficient computers powering everything from email to artificial intelligence. Denver alone projects nearly a 200% increase in data center growth, while utilities like Xcel Energy warn they will need $22 billion in new infrastructure to meet the rising demand for electricity.

Some are calling the Interstate 25 corridor “Data Center Row.” Others see potential for jobs and an increased tax base. And many Coloradans are asking a reasonable question: What does all this development actually mean for our communities, our water, our climate, and our energy bills?

As a researcher who studies the political and environmental dimensions of emerging technologies, the reality is this: Data centers are reshaping Colorado’s environmental and economic landscape in real time, and we need smart, transparent policy to guide that growth.

The scale is new, and enormous

A single AI-oriented data center can use as much electricity as 175,000 homes. Colorado has more than 60 data centers already, most clustered along the Front Range. Dozens more facilities, some exceeding 160 megawatts of power capacity, are planned or under construction.

This growth isn’t happening in isolation. Two federal executive orders issued this year removed environmental guardrails and fast-tracked data center construction nationwide. Colorado, eager not to lose investment to competitors like Texas, Iowa and Wyoming, has responded with tax incentives and the proposed “Data Center Development and Grid Modernization Act,” which sought to trade subsidies for basic energy and water stewardship requirements.

But even with efficiency improvements, the sheer scale of AI adoption means electricity demand is rising steeply, and the 1970s-era infrastructure we have isn’t built for the capacity of demand. Xcel projects that by 2040, data centers alone could require 8.5 gigawatts of power, roughly the equivalent of adding another Denver metro area to the grid.

The environmental impact is complex

Data centers are frequently criticized for their significant water needs and potential to strain local utilities. And it’s true that some proposed facilities in Colorado could consume hundreds of thousands of gallons per day if they rely on conventional evaporative cooling, putting a significant strain on an already scarce regional water supply.

But some newer facilities are adopting lower-water or water-free cooling technologies, such as liquid cooling, adiabatic systems and air-side economization. Still, these technologies are not yet industry-wide, and the cumulative effects of rapid data center growth could place real pressure on Colorado’s limited water supplies.

Energy use is also a key concern. Data centers currently account for 4.4% of U.S. electricity demand, and with rapid AI growth, that number could triple within a few years. Utilities may pass infrastructure costs on to ratepayers. And Colorado’s grid is still far from fully decarbonized. More load without more clean energy risks prolonging fossil fuel reliance.

Social impacts

Communities across the country have pushed back on data center proposals because of noise, diesel backup generators, light pollution, and secrecy around energy and water use. Colorado is starting to see the same concerns, particularly concerning the 600,000 square-foot center under construction in Denver’s densely populated Elyria-Swansea neighborhood.

Transparency remains a major problem. Some companies claim that disclosing energy or water use gives competitors an edge, leaving neighbors and local governments in the dark. And local officials, eager for economic development, may grant tax breaks without fully understanding long-term costs: increased grid infrastructure needs, potential rate hikes and land-use tradeoffs.

Meanwhile, the jobs picture is mixed. Construction jobs are plentiful, but once built, even massive data centers often employ fewer than 100 workers.

What can Colorado do?

Data centers are not going away; they are the backbone of the growing digital economy. But without effective policy, we risk letting the industry set the terms. Colorado can lead nationally by pursuing three principles:

Require full transparency on water, energy and emissions. Every data center should publicly report annual water use, cooling methods, electricity consumption and backup generator operations. Communities deserve to know what is being built in their backyard.

Tie incentives to real climate commitments. • 100% clean electricity procurement • Water-efficient or water-free cooling technologies • Investments in grid modernization that don’t fall solely on ratepayersColorado’s recent attempt — SB-280 — moved in this direction before collapsing under pressure. It should be revived and strengthened.

Plan for regional impacts, not project-by-project approvals.A single data center is manageable. Dozens clustered together can reshape electricity demand, land use and noise levels for an entire region. Colorado needs coordinated regional planning to avoid the chaotic landscapes seen elsewhere.

The reality is, data centers are foundational to how we live in the world today, and more so in the future. We know how to build them better, with community input and more sustainable resource use. We should demand that the infrastructure powering AI and the broader digital economy operates within Colorado’s environmental limits and contributes to a livable, resilient future.

If we get this right, Colorado can be a national leader in responsible AI infrastructure. If we get it wrong, we’ll spend decades trying to retrofit the consequences.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 06:59:01.756910

The secrecy around data center recruitment is a feature, not a bug.
Legislation has been introduced to prevent utilities from passing along data center infrastructure costs to consumers.","FOMO has broken out across Arkansas, as elected officials, unelected economic developers, utility companies and their regulators fall all over themselves not to miss out on the AI-fueled data center boom, a competition characterized by hyperbole, secrecy and healthy doses of wishful thinking.

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and state legislators are fueling the campaign to turn Arkansas into a mecca for data centers, expanding a sales tax exemption for new projects and allowing Entergy Arkansas and other utilities to bill consumers for the expanded generating capacity needed to satiate data centers’ voracious appetite for electricity.

Yet, amid splashy announcements of projects, sort-of projects and maybe someday projects, and the handing out of tax breaks like a freewheeling Santa on Christmas Eve, some pesky questions are being ignored.

Do the relatively modest number of jobs generated by data centers justify the infrastructure improvements and tax breaks being offered to lure them to Arkansas? Is it fair for power customers who live far afield from data centers to foot the bill for expanding capacity?

Is it appropriate or wise for state and local governments to provide corporate welfare subsidies to some of the most profitable companies on the planet — and to negotiate those deals in secret to avoid appropriate public scrutiny? Is opening up the candy store really necessary to compete for these projects, or are state and local leaders — driven by their fear of missing out — getting played?

As we try to move away from our reliance on fossil fuels to combat climate change, should we really be encouraging environmentally unfriendly projects that undermine our renewable energy goals by driving up electricity demand beyond what renewable sources can possibly supply?

And, more basically, is indulging FOMO a responsible way to make decisions that could alter the state’s landscape, raise our electric bills and shackle state and local governments to tax incentives for decades to come?

The AI boom has led to exponential growth in the number of data centers sprouting up across the country, as high-tech behemoths such as Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft look to ramp up their server capacity. The number of U.S. data centers now tops 4,200, just nine of which are in Arkansas.

But the past year has seen a proliferation of projects across the state — a $4 billion Google data center in West Memphis and vague proposals for $1 billion data centers in Little Rock, Conway and Clarksville. Although Google is rumored to be behind all three of these projects, middlemen are being used to negotiate tax breaks, so the names remain a secret.

Of course, state and local governments offering tax breaks and infrastructure improvements to lure new businesses is nothing new — the entire economic development industry is built around the practice. The traditional justification is that the new facility will generate a large number of jobs that will provide stable long-term employment for local residents.

While that argument might hold water when it comes to a new factory or assembly plant, it falls flat with data centers — facilities with gigantic footprints that consume copious amounts of electricity and water but provide relatively few jobs.

For example, the prospective data centers in Little Rock and Conway would occupy 300,000 square feet — more than five football fields — but employ just 50 people, about as many as would be in a modest-sized high school marching band. Google’s center in West Memphis will have just 300 permanent employees, on a campus of 1,100 acres, although it’s projected to provide 5,000 temporary jobs during construction.

And companies operating data centers have also been loath to guarantee that even these modest numbers of jobs will go to locals; indeed, some of the more high-paying technical jobs are likely to go to outsiders with specialized skills.

Republicans in the legislature called their bill allowing utility infrastructure costs to be passed along to consumers the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act. But how many jobs? For whom? At what cost?

While the impact on employment may be modest, data centers’ effect on the power supply is not. Electricity demand for data centers is forecast to triple by 2028, from 4% of total U.S. demand to 12%. And an analysis from the Harvard Electricity Law Initiative found that this alliance between utilities and Big Tech will shift billions in costs onto the shoulders of consumers, a trend we’re seeing already in Arkansas.

Entergy Arkansas customers, from Texarkana to Pocahontas and points in between, are going to pay on average $2 more per month to finance increased generating capacity to serve Google’s data center in West Memphis, under an agreement approved earlier this month by the Public Service Commission. Thus, customers who won’t receive economic benefit from this project will be paying to subsidize it.

A study from the University of Michigan also found that data center owners often negotiate sweetheart deals with utility companies for discounted rates, further shifting costs to consumers — and details of those deals are often kept secret.

We’ve also seen that in Arkansas: When Entergy presented details of its contract with Google to the PSC, the public was ordered to leave the hearing room so that “confidential” information could be discussed in secret.

The secrecy around data center recruitment is a feature, not a bug. And the primary beneficiaries are the tech companies who get public subsidies and discounted utility rates without subjecting themselves to the transparency or accountability we should expect in what’s left of our democracy.

If we want to see where all of this might lead, we might look to Virginia, which has been inundated with more than 660 data centers and where FOMO is giving way to regret.

Officials there are getting an earful from voters mad about noise and environmental impacts, higher utility rates and a paucity of new jobs. Legislation has been introduced to prevent utilities from passing along data center infrastructure costs to consumers. And a Democrat recently flipped a legislative seat that had been in Republican hands for decades by stressing the effect data centers were having on electricity prices.

As a Republican state senator put it, “People are now looking at this, going, ‘What the hell is going on?’”

That’s mostly due to an expected rise in electricity demand, a surge largely driven by the rise of high-powered data centers needed to train and run artificial intelligence (AI) models. But some of the plants have been ordered to stay open by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), despite significant environmental and financial costs. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former fracking executive, has frequently cited “winning the AI race” as a rationale for re-investing in coal.

The fossil fuel facilities are located in regions across the country, from Maryland to Michigan and Georgia to Wyoming. Together, their two dozen coal-fired generators emitted more than 68 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2024. That’s more than the total emissions of Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. combined.

Nearly 75 percent of the coal plants were on track to shutter in the next two years.

The delays buck the overall trend in the U.S., where coal’s importance as an energy source has diminished rapidly over the past two decades. Coal’s critics say this broad-based phaseout is an urgent matter of public and environmental health. Often called the “dirtiest fossil fuel,” coal creates more climate emissions per gigawatt-hour of electricity than any other power source. And the human impacts of its pollution have been profound: A 2023 study in Science attributed 460,000 extra U.S. deaths between 1999 and 2020 to sulfur dioxide particulate pollution belched out by coal plants.

Cara Fogler, managing senior analyst for the Sierra Club, called the recent spate of delayed closures “unacceptable.”

“We know these coal plants are dirty, they’re uneconomic, they’re costing customers so much money, and they’re polluting the air,” said Fogler, who co-authored a report showing many utilities have backtracked on climate commitments, including coal phaseouts, often citing data centers as a cause. “They need to be planned for retirement, and it’s really concerning to see utilities becoming so much more hesitant to take those steps.”

DeSmog identified the 15 plants by examining changes to the planned retirement dates listed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a DOE agency that compiles data on energy providers, as well as public statements from utilities and the Trump administration. Some of the voluntary delays appear to directly contradict previous net-zero pledges made by several companies.

Neither the Department of Energy nor American Power, a trade association representing the U.S. coal fleet, responded to requests for comment.

What Led to Coal’s Decline?

Not long ago, coal really did keep the lights on. In 2005, it provided roughly half of America’s electricity, making it by far the dominant power source nationwide. But in the past two decades, coal’s market share has rapidly waned. No new coal plants have come online since 2013. These days, its footprint has dwindled, with just 16 percent of the overall energy mix.

In March 2017, President Trump appeared to blame environmental regulations for coal’s poor fortunes — a trend he promised to reverse.

“The miners told me about the attacks on their jobs and their livelihoods,” Trump said at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters. “I made them this promise … My administration is putting an end to the war on coal.”

But environmental regulations didn’t kill coal. Instead, its demise became inevitable mostly thanks to the rise of a competing fossil fuel: natural gas.

Gas has both economic and technological advantages over coal, said David Lindequist, an economist at Miami University who co-authored a recent paper on the environmental impacts of the shale gas boom.

As new fracking technologies helped to flood the U.S. market with cheap gas in the mid-2000s, utilities began a broad coal-to-gas pivot that’s still underway today. Abundant, often less expensive gas flowed into power plants that operate more efficiently and nimbly than coal plants. This combination of price, efficiency, and flexibility made ditching coal an easy calculation for many utilities.

“The fact that we were able to so successfully phase out coal in the U.S. would never have happened without the fracking boom,” Lindequist said.

Today, coal is at an even greater disadvantage, as renewable energies continue to make economic and technological inroads. The International Renewable Energy Agency found that, in 2024, solar and wind routinely delivered electricity more cheaply than fossil sources of energy. That dynamic has helped solar in particular become the fastest-growing source of power in the U.S.

Meanwhile, America’s newest coal plant — the Sandy Creek plant near Waco, Texas, built way back in 2013 — is currently sitting idle after another catastrophic failure. It isn’t set to resume operations until 2027. The average U.S. coal plant is more than 40 years old, a factor that’s contributed to their decreasing reliability.

“These [coal] plants are so old that at this point there’s very little that could really revive the fleet,” said Michelle Solomon, manager in the electricity program at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation. “I’ve been using the analogy of an old car: Nothing is going to bring my car that has 200,000 miles on it back to being a brand new, efficient car.”

During the Biden years, as technological advancements and historic subsidies made renewables even more attractive, observers broadly believed that coal’s days were numbered. The “writing was on the wall” for coal, Lindequist said.

“Coal may retain a grip in U.S. politics, but its actual role in the generation system is shrinking annually,” researchers for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote in a 2024 report. “It is a trend we believe is irreversible.”

Yet even before Biden left office, a new dynamic began emerging: As tech companies started proposing billions in data center build-outs to feed the AI frenzy, utilities started to take a fresh look at their coal plants.

Data Centers Changed Coal’s Trajectory

In 2020, Dominion Energy, a utility that provides electricity to millions of customers across Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, announced non-binding plans to retire the Clover Power Station by 2025. Running the plant — an 877 megawatt (MW) coal-fired facility near Randolph, Virginia — would be uneconomical under any future scenario, the company found. It just didn’t make financial sense to keep it going.

It reversed course just three years later. Under its 2023 plan, Dominion projected that its energy demand from data centers would nearly quadruple by 2038. That’s an astonishing rise, considering that Virginia already leads the U.S. in data center development by a wide margin. Known as Data Center Alley, the state is home to more than one-third of the world’s largest-scale data centers. Today, Dominion says it doesn’t anticipate retiring any of its existing coal plants — including Clover — until at least 2045, the year that Virginia law stipulates its economy must be carbon-free.

Dominion wasn’t the only utility to cite data center growth as it backtracked on coal. In an August 2024 earnings call, executives of the Wisconsin-based utility Alliant Energy said that the company was “proactively working to attract” data center projects. A few months later, Alliant announced it would delay retiring the Columbia Energy Center, a coal-fired plant near Madison, from 2026 to 2029. The plant’s retirement had already been pushed back once.

The trend became notable enough to attract the attention of analysts at Frontier Group, an environmental think tank. In January 2025, Frontier analyst Quentin Good published a white paper showing that utilities had already cited data center growth as a rationale for delaying the phaseout of seven fossil fuel power plants across the U.S.

“We were concerned about the potential for all of this new electricity demand from data centers to slow down the transition to clean energy,” he told DeSmog. “In that report, we discovered it was basically happening already.”

But two other dynamics also began playing out in January: AI hype started to reach new levels of intensity, and power changed hands in Washington.

AI Hype Highs, New Coal Lows

Data centers aren’t the only reason for the recent upswing in electricity demand. Building electrification, industrial growth, and increased electric vehicle ownership all play roles, too. But nothing has quite caught utilities’ attention like data center projects, which are cropping up with highly localized impacts across the U.S. at a historic rate. Filled with stacks of high-powered computing equipment, the facilities are projected to account for about half of new electricity growth between 2025 and 2030.

On January 21, 2025 — one day after President Trump’s second inauguration — he revealed a new AI infrastructure joint venture involving ChatGPT parent company OpenAI called the Stargate Project, which would spend up to $500 billion on data center build-outs in the next four years. Tech executives announced the initiative’s details alongside Trump during the unveiling at a White House event.

Days later, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he planned to spend $65 billion on data center build-outs in 2025 alone, including one project “so large it would cover a significant portion of Manhattan.” These announcements followed a similar one from Microsoft in January: a pledge to spend $80 billion on data centers this calendar year.

As the world’s largest tech companies raced to outdo each other, a wave of delayed coal plant retirements followed.

On January 31, Southern Company, a utility serving over 9 million customers across 15 states, announced plans to delay the retirement of generators at two of the largest coal plants in the U.S., both in Georgia. The massive, coal-fired units — two at the Bowen Steam Plant outside Euharlee, and one at the Robert W. Scherer Power Plant in Juliette — had been scheduled to go offline between 2028 and 2035. Under its revised plan, the company pushed retirement back to as late as January 1, 2039(though both plants would be 40 percent co-fired with natural gas by 2030 in that scenario).

In legal documents and public statements, company spokespeople point to data centers as a key rationale for the delays. Last month, at an industry conference in Las Vegas, Southern Company CEO Chris Womack cited data center growth as a key factor keeping fossil energy online, according to the trade publication Data Center Dynamics.

“We’re going to extend coal plants as long as we can because we need those resources on the grid,” he reportedly said.

Next door in Mississippi, Southern Company also delayed the closure of a 500 MW generator at the Victor J. Daniel coal plant in Jackson County. It pushed the retirement back from 2028 until “the mid 2030s.” In documents filed with Mississippi’s Public Service Commission, the state’s utility regulator, Southern appeared to cite a 500 MW Compass Datacenters project as a reason for the change. Southern has pledged to be net-zero by 2050.

As the months passed, the same dynamic unfolded in other states. Alarmed, Good, the Frontier Group analyst, started to track the delays. By October, he published an update to Frontier’s report that found data centers had pushed back at least 12 coal plant closures in the past few years.

“The data center boom has shown no signs of abating,” he wrote. “Even more fossil fuel plants that had been scheduled to retire have been given a new lease on life.”

In its own analysis, DeSmog found that at least 15 coal plant retirements have been delayed since January 2025 alone. Together, those plants emitted nearly 1.5 percent of America’s total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions from 2024.

This comes at a time when the world’s nations need to cut their climate emissions roughly in half to avoid the worst impacts of global heating, according to a recent United Nations report.

But not all the delays can be attributed directly to data center growth. Some have stayed open for a different reason: top-down orders from the Trump administration.

The Department of Energy Steps in

The J.H. Campbell Generating Plant, a 1.5 gigawatt coal plant in Ottawa County, Michigan, was scheduled to close May 31. The plant even held public tours to give a rare, behind-the-scenes look at aging fossil infrastructure, before it shut its doors for good.

“Now we know cleaner, renewable ways to generate electricity,” a Campbell employee told members of the public on a September 2024 tour.

But just eight days before scheduled to shutter, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright ordered Campbell to stay open another 90 days, citing an “emergency” shortage of energy in the Midwest.

Keeping the plant open cost its owner, Consumers Energy, almost $30 million in just five weeks, the company said. Though the plant’s closure was projected to save ratepayers more than $650 million by 2050, Campbell was costing more than $615,000 a day as of September. Yet Wright has since extended his order twice. Campbell now is scheduled to stay open until at least February 2026.

“The costs to operate the Campbell plant will be shared by customers across the Midwest electric grid region,” including customers serviced by other utilities, Matt Johnson, a Consumers Energy spokesperson told DeSmog by email.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is challenging DOE’s order to keep Campbell open, calling the orders “arbitrary.”

“DOE is using outdated information to fabricate an emergency, despite the fact that the truth is publicly available for everyone to see,” Nessel said in a November 20 press release. “DOE must end its unlawful tactics to keep this coal plant running when it has already cost millions upon millions of dollars.”

Meanwhile, DOE is telling a very different story.

“Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race,” Wright said in September, as the Department of Energy announced $350 million in funding for coal plant upgrades, along with other incentives.

Energy Innovation’s Solomon called the funding “a waste of taxpayer dollars.”

“We’ve been calling it a ‘cash for clunkers’ program where you don’t trade in the clunker,” she said. “Trying to build a modern electricity system using the most expensive and least reliable source of power is really not the answer.”

However, the Trump administration said in September that it plans to feed the AI boom — with an estimated 100 gigawatts of capacity in the next five years — by keeping more old coal plants open. “I would say the majority of that coal capacity will stay online,” Wright said.

Executives from Colorado’s Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association confirmed to DeSmog that they also expect an order to keep a 421 MW coal-fired generator at Craig Station open past its December 2025 decommissioning date.

In late October, Colorado Congressman Jeff Hurd sent a letter to the Trump administration, urging it to extend the life of a 400 MW coal generator at the Comanche Power Station near Pueblo as the owner, Xcel Energy, works to repair the plant’s chronically troubled main reactor. The smaller unit was slated to go offline in December — but, in its case, the administration never needed to act. Last month, Xcel, with the help of Colorado Governor Jared Polis, began to lobby to keep it open at least another 12 months. The state utility regulator appears to have granted that request, according to an agreement with Xcel and other stakeholders.

This delay wasn’t just due to data centers, though their numbers are growing in Colorado. Xcel spokesperson Michelle Aguayo said the delay was “due to a convergence of issues,” including rising electricity demand, “supply chain challenges,” and the continued outage at the main generator. “We continue to make significant progress towards our emission reduction goals approved by the state which would require us to retire our coal units by 2030,” she said.

Delaying the Inevitable

Whether the data center boom will play out as projected is still a matter of speculation.

Last month, power consulting firm Grid Strategies reported that utilities may be overestimating electricity demand from data centers by as much as 40 percent. That’s due in part to the many hypothetical projects, and a widespread practice of double- and triple-counting. Tech companies tend to pitch utilities in multiple regions as they shop around for incentives, creating the appearance of demand from many more data hubs than actually will be built.

Experts have a name for this growing phenomenon: “phantom data centers.”

At the same time, a growing chorus of critics are warning of an AI bubble, arguing that runaway costs can’t justify the kinds of investment being floated. Even the head of Google’s parent company has acknowledged the “irrationality” of the boom.

Critics also says contradictory actions taken by the Trump administration — citing an “energy emergency” while canceling billions in funding for renewable projects — are making the problem worse.

Yet even with all the unknowns, one thing’s certain: Coal’s role in America’s power push can be extended, but it can’t last forever.

Seth Feaster, an IEEFA analyst, says even AI hasn’t changed the big picture: Eventually, coal will die, and it will be killed by other, cheaper forms of energy.

He called the current phenomenon a “period of pause and delay.” In his view, the technological and economic rationales for quitting coal remain undeniable.

“The policy changes here may have a delaying effect on the decline of coal, but they are certainly not changing the direction of coal’s future,” he told DeSmog.

The questions for now are, how long the delays will continue — and at what cost.",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/coal-plant-delays-ai-trump-graphic-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 05:59:11.481367

The Intertubes practically erupted in flames on December 11 when word broke that the Ford Motor Company and the leading South Korean firm SK On abruptly dropped their EV battery manufacturing joint ventures in Kentucky and Tennessee. Although the breakup was reportedly mutual, Ford indicated that SK may have jumped the gun on a formal announcement. “We are aware of SK’s disclosure and we have nothing further to share at this time” was all the iconic US automaker had to say at the close of the business day on December 11.

EV Batteries From SK & Ford: How It Started …

For those of you new to the topic of EV batteries, the Kentucky connection may seem a mystery wrapped in an enigma. Kentucky is widely known as a showcase for the traditional industries that made America great: horse racing, booze, and tobacco. Nevertheless, Kentucky has also been building up its auto manufacturing profile. Ford, for example, has two longstanding operations in the state, the Louisville Assembly Plant and the Kentucky Truck Plant.

Under the EV-friendly umbrella of the Joe Biden administration, Ford added onto its footprint in both states, with the Kentucky venture being a particularly high-profile development. In 2021, Ford announced a partnership with SK to manufacture EV batteries at a new facility located in Glendale, Kentucky, under the name “BlueOval SK Battery Park,” in support of Ford’s ambitious new EV manufacturing campus in the adjacent state of Tennessee.

“With production expected to begin in 2025, the all-new $5.8 billion, 1,500-acre dedicated battery manufacturing complex – BlueOval SK Battery Park – will create approximately 5,000 new jobs and help strengthen the local community,” Ford enthused in a press statement dated September 29, 2021.

The company’s North America COO, Lisa Drake, also chipped in her two cents. “Ford is excited to make this historic investment in the commonwealth of Kentucky, a state that has been part of the Ford story since we rolled a Model T down an assembly line in Louisville in 1913,” Drake said in a press statement.

… How It’s Going …

In the same press announcement, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear complimented Ford and SK for laying down the single biggest investment in state history. “It will transform our economy, creating a better Kentucky, with more opportunities, for our families for generations,” Beshear said.

“Never again will we be thought of as a fly over state. Our time is now. Our future is now,” he emphasized.

Gov. Beshear was equally enthusiastic in August of this year, when operations at the new battery campus commenced.

“Today, Kentucky marks a historic milestone four years in the making as production officially begins at two of the largest battery plants in the world, set to deliver EV batteries that will transform the automotive industry and the future of our commonwealth,” he cheered, again thanking SK On alongside Ford for the workforce opportunity.

Yeah, about that…. Another SK–Ford battery plant in Tennessee was also impacted by the breakup. Memphis Commercial Appeal reporter Corey Davis was among those getting the lowdown from SK. “Under the agreement, a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will have full ownership and operate the battery plant in Tennessee, according to a statement SK On issued Dec. 11,” Davis observed.

“Ford said it was aware of SK On’s disclosure and had nothing further to share,” Davis added.

While Ford had nothing further to share, Kentucky Public Radio reporter Joe Tonka was among those taking note of Gov. Beshear’s take on the matter. “In his Thursday press conference, Gov. Andy Beshear said Ford is expected to give more details about the future of the Kentucky plant early next week. He also expressed optimism about Ford retaining ownership, noting its long history in Kentucky,” Tonka wrote.

… And, Who’s Gonna Pay The Piper?

As reported by KPR, Gov. Beshear also took the opportunity to point out that elections have consequences. In July, the Republican-controlled Congress passed a new tax bill endorsed by US President Donald Trump, which put an end to the $7,500 federal EV tax credit as of September 30. The end of the tax credit is widely recognized as the single most significant factor causing a steep drop in EV sales after September 30, leading Ford and other EV makers to scale back their near-term manufacturing plans.

“Beshear addressed that bill Thursday, calling out President Donald Trump and Republican US Representative Brett Guthrie, whose district includes Glendale,” Tonka reported:

“I’m still amazed that the President would push through such a job-killing bill that cut subsidies and grants that companies and people had relied upon,” Beshear said. “And it’s really disappointing that Brett Guthrie, who has three EV plants in his district, would be the one that champions it, pushes it through and doesn’t make any changes at all to protect those plants.”

“So if we have people that lose their jobs, or jobs that are not created, your own congressman did it to you, and that’s really, really wrong. Your governor is going to do his best. I’m going to do my best to make sure we have as many jobs at those facilities as possible.”

To the surprise of nobody at all, Tonka further reported that Rep. Guthrie’s office failed to issue a timely response to an email request for a comment from KPR.

One state-level Republican elected representative did respond to the news, though he refrained from throwing stones at Rep. Guthrie. “Republican state Sen. Matt Deneen, whose district includes Glendale, said in a press release that he hopes Ford assumes full operational control and ‘remains committed to the long-term success of the Glendale plant,” Tonka reported.

As the saying goes, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride. If Senator Deneen really wants the Glendale plant to cling to life, he may want to actually do something other than blathering his hopes and dreams to whoever happens to be listening. At the very least, he could pick up the phone and bend the ear of Guthrie and the other Republican members of the Kentucky Congressional delegation, all of whom who voted in favor of the new tax bill — namely, Senators Paul Rand and Mitch McConnell, and House members James Comer, Andy Barr, Thomas Massie, Harold Rogers — and plead with them to fix what they have broken.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ford-ev-battery-factory-kentucky.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 04:58:35.537401

Over the coming months, Tomago Aluminium will work with the Federal and NSW Governments on a long-term renewable energy solution to support the smelter’s viability when its current energy contract expires in 2028.

The partnership aims to deliver a long-term, fixed-price power purchasing agreement for the smelter, along with concessional finance arrangements to accelerate renewable energy generation and storage developments in NSW.

As part of a successful agreement Tomago Aluminium will contribute at least $1 billion in capital and major maintenance investment over the next decade, which includes identifying further decarbonisation opportunities for the smelter.

This represents a significant milestone towards securing the smelter’s ongoing operations.

The Commonwealth Government, NSW Government and Tomago Aluminium are working together to secure more reliable, renewable energy supply for heavy industry in the Hunter region.

The Coalition’s “wasted decade” of energy policies saw 24 of the nation’s 28 coal‑fired power stations announce closures without a plan to replace this energy generation – scaring off investment in regional industries.

“We want to ensure that Tomago continues to forge Australia’s prosperity, and it continues to create and sustain good, skilled jobs.

“I want to thank the workers and the Hunter community who have faced uncertainty in recent weeks.

“My government is working together with the NSW State Government and Tomago Aluminium on a new energy agreement that will secure the future of the facility.

“Tomago has a proud place in Australia’s history – and we will ensure it has a central place in Australia’s future”

“Tomago Aluminium is a vital facility for the Hunter region, Australia’s aluminium value chain and Australia’s national interest.

“We want the Tomago workers to have as much certainty as possible – and I want to reassure the community that every lever in government is being looked at to secure industry in the Hunter.”

Quotes attributable to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen

“Tomago Aluminium has made it clear: to remain competitive and secure its future the smelter needs a reliable and affordable supply of renewable energy, with ageing coal-fired power options being prohibitively expensive.

It's fitting that Toyota's North Carolina plant is located in Liberty. EVs are one of the best ways for motorists to gain independence from dirty-fuel-burning rides. Owners typically save up to $1,500 a year on gas and service costs with no more oil or some other fluid changes. And certain states still offer perks for buying and charging them.

Charging at home is the cheapest way to power your ride, maximizing savings worth potentially thousands of dollars a year when compared to gas and public fast-charging stations, according to Qmerit. The service can help you get the best deal for a Level 2 charger installation at home. Level 2 chargers typically fill a battery in four to 10 hours, which is not as fast as public stations such as Tesla Superchargers, per the Department of Transportation.

An EV also prevents thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution each year when it replaces a gas vehicle, even in states where dirty fuels create the electricity to charge them, the Department of Energy reports. Tailpipe exhaust is a known lung troubler, and the American Lung Association says that limiting the fumes can improve breathing by clearing neighborhood air.

EV owners can add to the benefits with home solar. A rooftop system can provide free sun energy to charge the cleaner rides, removing reliance on the grid and public stations. The Cool Down's Solar Explorer can help you compare quotes, find an installer, and secure tax breaks that expire Dec. 31, saving you up to $10,000 in upfront costs. EnergySage is one of the trusted partners that can discover the best setup for your home.

On the charging front, Qmerit can gather quotes and other information to help you land the right tech, ensuring you are using the electricity as efficiently as possible when powering up your EV.

New York can more aggressively target its carbon emission reduction goals by reducing the number and scope of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative carbon allowances it issues to the power sector, according to proposed regulations announced Wednesday by state authorities.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, or DEC, and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or NYSERDA, said in a release that the proposed alterations to the state’s Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative regulations would “achieve affordable and effective reductions in pollutants” while prioritizing energy affordability.

The proposed amendments would reduce the annual budget of CO2 allowances through 2037. That includes a reduction in the number of allowances set aside for long-term contracts, and in the number of voluntary renewable energy purchases, “while still maintaining enough allowances to accommodate anticipated demand.” It would also remove the option for offset projects.

“DEC’s proposed RGGI updates would reduce the regional emissions cap to approximately 69.8 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2027, then decline 89% relative to the 2024 cap through 2037,” NYSERDA said in a release. “This would result in carbon dioxide emissions decreasing by approximately 10% annually through 2033, followed by 3% annually until 2037.”

The proposed changes remove all references to CO2 offset projects. Previously, New York allowed offset projects in the form of landfill methane capture and avoided agricultural methane.

The states currently participating in RGGI are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. New York’s proposal to strengthen its RGGI regulations comes one month after Pennsylvania left the program as part of a budget deal struck between Gov. Josh Shapiro, D-PA, and state legislators.

DEC and NYSERDA characterized the RGGI ramp-up in opposition to the Trump administration’s policies seeking to limit the deployment of renewable energy projects.

“In a time when New York and other states are facing federal headwinds, these proposed updates demonstrate a collective solidarity among states,” said NYSERDA’s CEO Doreen Harris in a release.

Google DeepMind’s partnership with Commonwealth Fusion Systems shows how advanced artificial intelligence can help overcome some of fusion’s most challenging physics challenges.

Global developments show that fusion is becoming a strategic technology arena with massive economic potential, with trillions of dollars in future clean-energy value.

The global pursuit of fusion energy – a potentially safe, abundant, zero-carbon power source – has entered a decisive phase, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

A new fusion roadmap published by the US Department of Energy in October outlines how the technology could enter that country’s energy mix by the early 2030s.

“Fusion is real, near and ready for coordinated action,” said Jean Paul Allain, associate director of the department’s Office of Fusion Energy Sciences .

Artificial intelligence (AI) could help turn that goal into a reality.

On the same day that the US Department of Energy announced its national strategy to accelerate the development and commercialization of fusion energy, AI research company Google DeepMind and fusion energy startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) announced a research partnership to help accelerate the timeline to deliver fusion energy to the grid.

“The combination of our AI expertise with CFS’s cutting-edge hardware makes this the ideal partnership to advance foundational discoveries in fusion energy for the benefit of the worldwide research community and ultimately, the whole world,” wrote Google DeepMind’s fusion team in a blog post.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright has underscored AI’s emerging role by noting its potential to enable breakthroughs in materials science, digital modelling of stellar fusion processes and molecular dynamics. “It’s hard to overstate the catalytic effect of artificial intelligence,” he said.

The global race to deliver fusion power

Fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, promises nearly limitless energy without carbon emissions or long-lived waste, which has excited scientists since the 1950s. While achieving net-energy gain has long been a scientific challenge, progress is accelerating across multiple fronts, putting the technology on the radar of the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Energy Technology Frontiers.

Since the 1980s, 33 nations and thousands of engineers and scientists have collaborated to build and operate a “tokamak” – a magnetic fusion device – as part of the ITER project, the world’s largest fusion experiment.

In parallel, governments, utilities and private industry are expanding the fusion ecosystem. At least 45 companies worldwide are pursuing commercial fusion and the IAEA reports that more than 160 fusion facilities are now operational, under construction or planned. Early power-purchase agreements from end users such as Google, global energy company Eni and Microsoft signal rising industry confidence.

One of the most evident signs that fusion is moving from a scientific experiment to a commercial reality is a milestone noted in the IAEA World Fusion Outlook 2025: the first-ever global modelling of fusion energy deployment.

Conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the study projects that fusion generation will rise from 2 TWh in 2035 to 375 TWh in 2050, reaching nearly 25,000 TWh by 2100. The analysis highlights fusion’s potential to add trillions of dollars to global gross domestic product as demand for clean electricity surges.

The modelling also highlights fusion’s economic value: as demand for clean electricity generation rises, fusion could add trillions of dollars to global gross domestic product, according to the IAEA.

Governments increasingly view fusion as strategic. A recent report from Swiss company EconSight, which tracks technology trends and patents, shows China leading the field, filing 67% of world-class fusion patents between 2016 and 2023, compared to 19% in the US and 5% in Europe.

How AI might help advance plasma physics

Major hurdles remain, however, before fusion becomes a staple of the energy mix. Controlling the plasma in magnetic confinement fusion is challenging, as it must remain confined and within a stable, defined volume for a prolonged period. The heat and pressure cause expansion but any contact with the reactor walls instantly cools it and halts the fusion reaction.

The DeepMind and CFS partnership builds on work using AI to successfully control plasma. With academic partners at the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), Google showed that deep reinforcement learning can control the magnets of a tokamak to stabilize complex plasma shapes. It also developed TORAX, a fast and differentiable plasma simulator.

DeepMind will now apply these tools to CFS’s programme. Combining TORAX with reinforcement learning or evolutionary search methods such as AlphaEvolve, AI agents can explore vast numbers of operating scenarios, identifying the most efficient pathways to net-energy production.

DeepMind is also developing an AI pilot to control magnetic configurations, optimize fusion power and manage heat load for CFS’s SPARC reactor outside Boston.

CFS aims to bring its first grid-scale fusion plant online in the early 2030s and has already secured off-take agreements from Google and Eni, the latter valued at more than $1 billion. Both companies are also investors. With no materials-resource constraints, CFS says it could scale up to produce up to 1,000 plants per year by 2050.

CFS is racing against Helion, another US fusion startup backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, which plans to bring a fusion power plant online by 2028 and has signed Microsoft as its first off-take partner.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_dpKroRHnD4LCiG8YJK1LhB8GNnYG4_EWLsNX07zUzD0.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 05:59:19.739653

Consumer Insights: You directly benefit from industry collaboration through lower prices, faster innovation deployment, and greater choice as manufacturers combine strengths. Insights for Brands: The question isn't whether to partner but how strategically to structure alliances maximizing mutual benefits while maintaining brand differentiation—isolation means irrelevance in the emerging automotive landscape.

Final Thought: The Dawn of Collaborative Automotive

The Partnership Era Has Begun. The Ford-Renault alliance exemplifies fundamental industry restructuring where collaboration supersedes competition as primary strategic imperative. Traditional automakers face impossible economics attempting independent EV development across all segments while maintaining combustion portfolios during transition. Partnerships provide survival path by spreading astronomical development costs, accelerating time-to-market, and leveraging complementary strengths across brands, regions, and capabilities.

Expect proliferation of partnerships across automotive landscape as manufacturers recognize isolated approaches cannot deliver affordable EVs at scale required for mass adoption. Winners will excel at alliance management—identifying optimal partners, structuring mutually beneficial agreements, and executing seamless collaboration across organizational and national boundaries. Losers will cling to independence until resource depletion forces desperate mergers from weakness positions.

The future belongs to collaborative networks rather than individual companies, with successful brands participating in multiple complementary partnerships addressing different technologies, regions, and segments. Ford-Renault represents blueprint for partnership-driven future where brands maintain distinct identities and customer relationships while sharing underlying platforms, manufacturing infrastructure, and development resources. Consumers benefit from expanded choice at accessible prices as collaboration economics enable affordability breakthroughs impossible through individual efforts. The automotive industry is permanently transformed—the partnership era has arrived.

Trends 2026: Alliance Economics and the Affordable EV Revolution

When Cooperation Beats Competition and Price Beats Premium. The automotive industry is experiencing Alliance Economics combined with the Affordable EV Revolution—a rapid-fire wave of partnerships, joint ventures, and strategic collaborations as manufacturers recognize cooperation delivers better outcomes than competition in capital-intensive EV transition while simultaneously breaking down price barriers that have kept mainstream consumers on the sidelines.

Vertical Integration Reversal: Companies abandon traditional vertical integration in favor of horizontal partnerships specializing in specific value chain layers. Platform providers focus on architecture, brand companies emphasize customer experience, and service operators manage charging and mobility.

Cross-Border Innovation Flows: Partnerships facilitate knowledge transfer across geographic and cultural boundaries, accelerating global technology deployment. European efficiency meets American design sensibility while Asian manufacturing prowess combines with Western brand equity.

Risk Distribution Networks: Multiple overlapping partnerships create safety nets where no single relationship failure proves catastrophic. Smart manufacturers participate in diverse alliances providing technology access, market reach, and capability development across multiple domains.

Speed-to-Market Compression: Partnership-enabled development cycles compress by 30-40% compared to independent programs, allowing rapid response to market shifts and competitive threats. Shared platforms and manufacturing eliminate redundant activities accelerating commercialization timelines.

Mass Market Price Accessibility: The €25,000-€35,000 EV segment finally emerges as partnerships enable cost structures previously impossible for individual manufacturers. Shared development expenses, manufacturing optimization, and scale economies drive pricing toward combustion vehicle parity, unlocking mass adoption.

Middle-Class EV Adoption Wave: Affordable partnership-based EVs trigger mainstream consumer transition from curiosity to purchase as economic barriers crumble. The Ford-Renault €30,000 target price point represents inflection where EVs become financially viable for European middle class rather than luxury reserved for affluent early adopters.

Implications for Automotive Industry: Restructure around partnership capabilities rather than self-sufficiency—competitive advantage shifts from internal prowess to alliance orchestration excellence. Identify complementary partners across technologies, regions, and capabilities while maintaining distinct brand positioning. Invest in collaboration infrastructure including governance frameworks, cultural integration programs, and knowledge transfer mechanisms. Simultaneously, engineer aggressive cost reduction through every aspect of vehicle development and manufacturing to achieve sub-€30,000 pricing that opens mass market floodgates. Recognize that future industry leaders will be those mastering multi-partner ecosystems while delivering genuine affordability rather than vertically-integrated monoliths pursuing premium positioning. The brands thriving in 2030 are those building partnership portfolios today that position them at centers of collaborative networks delivering comprehensive solutions at accessible prices impossible through isolated efforts. Affordability becomes the ultimate differentiator as technical capabilities converge—winners make EVs economically rational for average consumers, not just environmentally conscious elites.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/9d60f9_fa7ccfd555a54f8fb003e9acf52ad485~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_720,h_432,al_c,lg_1,q_85/9d60f9_fa7ccfd555a54f8fb003e9acf52ad485~mv2.png",N,,2025-12-12 03:57:14.124460

Korean battery makers LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and SK On are all accelerating the conversion of underutilized EV battery lines into ESS production amid deteriorating visibility for global EV demand.
""ESS battery demand currently stands at about 20 to 25 percent of the EV market, but ESS offers relatively stable structural growth,"" said Chung.
Korean players, however, still lag global leaders: they hold roughly 24 percent of the global EV battery market but less than 10 percent of ESS as of mid-2025.
Chinese manufacturers CATL, Hithium, and EVE Energy dominate the ESS landscape, largely thanks to low-cost LFP production.","SEOUL, December 12 (AJP) - The dissolution of the $11.4 billion battery joint venture between SK On and Ford Motor stands as a stark symbol of the shifting center of gravity in the global battery business — away from electric vehicles and toward energy storage systems (ESS), where surging power demands from AI-driven data centers are rewriting the industry's growth map.

The two companies will formally part ways in the first quarter of 2026, splitting control of three giga factories launched together in 2022. SK On will take full ownership of the 45-gigawatt-hour plant in Stanton, Tennessee, while Ford assumes the twin sites in Glendale, Kentucky, totaling 82 GWh.

The breakup, while abrupt, offers SK On a strategic reset. Freed from exclusive commitments to Ford, it can now supply a broader pool of customers — particularly utilities, hyperscale data-center operators, and ESS integrators repositioning for the grid-scale storage boom. The shift also reflects Ford's own retreat: its EV unit has lost more than $5 billion this year, prompting the automaker to delay mass production of its next-generation electric pickup to 2028.

Strategic Reset

The restructuring sharply improves SK On's balance sheet. Nearly 10 trillion won ($6.7 billion) in BlueOval SK liabilities currently sit on SK On's consolidated financials. The separation will transfer roughly half of that debt off its books, reducing annual interest expenses by about 250 billion won while giving SK On full access to U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) production tax credits.

The company has already set an aggressive ESS roadmap, targeting up to 10 GWh in orders next year by converting EV battery lines at its Tennessee and Georgia plants. Mass production of LFP-based ESS cells is slated for the second half of 2026.

Korean battery makers LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and SK On are all accelerating the conversion of underutilized EV battery lines into ESS production amid deteriorating visibility for global EV demand. At the same time, hyperscale data centers — driven by rising AI workloads — are consuming electricity at unprecedented levels, turning grid-scale batteries into a cornerstone of power-stability infrastructure.

""EV batteries face strict weight and volume constraints that demand high energy density and output, but ESS units are stationary installations with relatively fewer space limitations,"" said Chung Won-suk, an analyst at iM Securities.

SK On is separately converting its Stellantis joint venture plant in Indiana into an ESS-dedicated facility targeting 30 GWh of annual capacity by end-2025. Utilization at the plant has dropped below 50 percent amid Stellantis' EV pullback following the phaseout of U.S. federal purchase subsidies in September.

ESS Momentum

Samsung SDI is in advanced talks to supply Tesla with about 3 trillion won in ESS batteries over three years — roughly 10 GWh annually — marking what could be the company's first large-scale alliance with the world's dominant ESS integrator.

LG Energy Solution, which already supplies Tesla with 20 GWh of LFP cells a year, is negotiating to raise that volume by 50 percent to 30 GWh. Combined, Korean suppliers would deliver 40 GWh annually to Tesla, substantially widening the EV maker's diversification away from Chinese giants CATL and BYD.

SNE Research projects the global ESS market to expand more than sixfold from 185 GWh in 2023 to 1,232 GWh by 2035. Unlike EVs — where demand is vulnerable to consumer sentiment, macro cycles, subsidies, and policy swings — ESS growth is driven by structural factors: renewable-energy penetration, grid stability requirements, and escalating data-center loads.

""ESS battery demand currently stands at about 20 to 25 percent of the EV market, but ESS offers relatively stable structural growth,"" said Chung. ""That is why its sustainability is rated more highly than EVs.""

Korean players, however, still lag global leaders: they hold roughly 24 percent of the global EV battery market but less than 10 percent of ESS as of mid-2025. Chinese manufacturers CATL, Hithium, and EVE Energy dominate the ESS landscape, largely thanks to low-cost LFP production.

U.S.–China tech rivalry is simultaneously creating an opening. The IRA grants significant tax credits for ESS made with U.S.-produced components, giving Korean manufacturers — already operating large-scale facilities across North America — an edge at a time when Chinese firms face steep trade barriers.

Korean automakers themselves are shifting more of their product portfolios toward LFP. Though LFP offers lower energy density than nickel-based NCM batteries, it is roughly 30 percent cheaper and more durable under extreme temperatures and long operating cycles — characteristics ideal for storage systems and affordable EVs alike.

LG Energy Solution began LFP production at its Michigan plant in June and plans to expand North American ESS capacity to 30 GWh by 2026. Its joint venture with Stellantis in Canada is also reallocating parts of its NCM lines toward ESS.

Separately this week, LG Energy Solution announced a $1.4 billion EV battery contract with Mercedes-Benz, believed by analysts to involve LFP cells targeting mid-priced models — another sign of Europe's pivot away from high-cost chemistries.

Samsung SDI also unveiled a multiyear, 2-trillion-won ESS contract with a U.S. energy developer, representing roughly 15 percent of its annual revenue and marking its first substantial move into the LFP segment long dominated by Chinese rivals.

While LFP appears ascendant, Korean engineers are betting that NCM technology could reclaim market share once it further reduces costs and demonstrates superior safety and energy performance.

""Provided that NCM batteries can prove technical sovereignty over LFP and cut prices, we believe the market will eventually sway back to safer and durable nickel variants in the long run,"" said Kim Sung-soo, head of smart batteries at Pai Chai University.

,EPA,2025-12-12 07:16:47+00:00,Coastal Review,Public hearing Tuesday on proposed 'WOTUS' definition | Coastal Review,Jennifer Allen,,,,,https://coastalreview.org/2025/12/public-hearing-tuesday-on-proposed-wotus-definition/,"Expanded in the 1970s, the measure is typically referred to as the Clean Water Act.
“It’s only things that meet the definition of waters of the United States, and that isn’t defined in the statute itself,” Sabath continued.
“Importantly, this analysis relies on wetland ‘wetness’ during the growing season, but the proposed rule uses the ‘wet season,’” Gold said.
“The agencies proposed ‘wet season’ dataset classifies most of the year, and in some cases the entire year, as ‘wet’ for much of coastal North Carolina.
Carey sees the proposed rule as demonstrating “that the EPA has abdicated its mandated responsibility to protect the environment and the people who depend on it.","The two federal branches that enforce the Clean Water Act last month pitched changes to the “waters of the United States” definition, which establishes the types of waterbodies that are federally protected against pollution, and if these amendments pass as written, conservation groups fear millions of acres of nontidal wetlands will be left vulnerable.

The Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers have for decades had the authority to regulate “navigable waters,” which means “the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,” as written in the 1948 Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Expanded in the 1970s, the measure is typically referred to as the Clean Water Act.

The EPA explains on its website that the Clean Water Act “establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters.”

One thing the Clean Water Act doesn’t do is clearly define “waters of the United States.” The EPA calls it a “threshold term in the Clean Water Act and establishes the geographic scope of federal jurisdiction under the Act.”

EPA and Army leadership announced Nov. 17 plans to update the definition, which has been the subject of lawsuits and years’ worth of arguments.

The “Updated Definition of ‘’Waters of the United States’’’ was published Nov. 20 in the Federal Register, launching a 45-day comment period on the proposed changes that closes Jan. 5. A virtual public meeting is scheduled for 12:30 to 4 p.m. Tuesday, with a 2-2:30 p.m. break. Attendees must register online to speak by 5 p.m. Monday. To listen only, register by the start of the meeting.

This latest attempt, which would exclude isolated wetlands, is directly linked to the Supreme Court’s May 2023 Sackett v. EPA decision. The Sacketts are an Idaho couple fined in the late 2000s for backfilling a section of their property that the EPA considered wetlands.

Judges ruled in the final opinion on the case that the “(Clean Water Act)’s use of ‘waters’” only refers to geographical features described in everyday language “as ‘streams, oceans, rivers and lakes’ and to adjacent wetlands that are ‘indistinguishable’ from those bodies of water due to a continuous surface connection.”

Earlier that year, the EPA had finalized a “Revised Definition of ‘Waters of the United States'” rule that took effect March 20, 2023, and which the Sackett case invalidated. In August 2023, the EPA and Army Corps issued an amendment to align the rule with the Sackett decision.

That final conforming rule is what the EPA and Army Corps leadership are proposing to amend.

The agencies argue that the change “would fully implement” the Supreme Court’s ruling “by ensuring federal jurisdiction is focused on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water—such as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes—and wetlands that are connected and indistinguishable from such waterbodies.”

With this proposed rule, the agencies explain in the docket, they “intend to provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency by clarifying the definition of ‘waters of the United States.’ This proposed rule is also intended to implement the overall objective of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the quality of the Nation’s waters while respecting State and Tribal authority over their own land and water resources.”

Environmental groups argued then, when the Sackett case was ruled, and still maintain that by removing protections from the millions of acres of nontidal wetlands, there will be consequences: Water quality will be jeopardized and flooding will increase, to name just two.

Southern Environmental Law Center Senior Attorney Mark Sabath said in an interview that for 50 years, the Clean Water Act has been the strongest and best federal protection for many of the waters and wetlands around the country.

The law does that “by saying you can’t pollute, you can’t fill, you can’t destroy certain features, certain waters, without a permit,” Sabath said, and the permitting process means that there are certain protections and controls you have to apply to minimize the amount of destruction.

Sabath added that a number of features of the Clean Water Act are dependent on the type of water, and, in addressing its critics, not every puddle in the country covered by the act.

“It’s only things that meet the definition of waters of the United States, and that isn’t defined in the statute itself,” Sabath continued. “Congress didn’t define it, so EPA and the Army Corps, in a series of rules over the years, have tried to define exactly what wetlands are and aren’t covered by the Clean Water Act.”

This proposed rule is the latest revision and it is “by far the most narrow, the most extreme definition,” Sabath continued. “It includes the fewest number of streams and wetlands and other waters of any interpretation of ‘waters the United States’ that we’ve seen.”

North Carolina Wildlife Federation Conservation Policy Vice President Manley Fuller told Coastal Review that with this proposed rule, the bottom line is a massive loss of protection of waters of the United States, which are vital habitats for fish and wildlife.

“This will also negatively affect hunting and fishing, which are a significant part of our natural resource-based economy,” he continued. “Wetlands are also buffers for the built environment and help reduce downstream flooding. Protecting clean waters and wetlands is extremely popular with the public for many reasons and we need to strengthen rather than weaken these programs.”

North Carolina Sierra Club Deputy Director Erin Carey told Coastal Review the rule will effectively remove federal protections from at least 80% of wetlands and over 5 million miles of streams across the country.

“This rule will open millions of acres of wetlands to the threat of development, leaving communities already vulnerable to flooding without the frontline protection afforded by these invaluable habitats. Wetlands act as filters for floodwaters and other runoff, making them critical not only to flood mitigation, but to the preservation of clean water resources,” Carey said.

Environmental Defense Fund Coasts and Watersheds Science Senior Manager Dr. Adam Gold pointed out as well that if the proposed rule is implemented as written, nearly all nontidal wetlands and intermittent streams could be without Clean Water Act protections in North Carolina and across the United States.

While there are many changes in the proposed rule, the most notable are to the definitions of “relative permanence” of waters and a “continuous surface connection” for wetlands, Gold said, adding that the proposed language introduces the concept of a “wet season.”

“Under the proposed rule, wetlands and waters would only receive Clean Water Act protections if they have surface water throughout the ‘wet season,’ described in the rule as ‘an extended period where there is continuous surface hydrology resulting from predictable seasonal precipitation patterns year after year,’” Gold said. “This proposed rule would make it easier to drain or develop wetlands that do not meet the ‘wet season’ surface water requirement, putting our wetlands and the benefits they provide at serious risk.”

In North Carolina, the impact of the proposed rule is 3.2 million acres, or about 88%, of nontidal wetlands estimated to be without Clean Water Act protections. “Importantly, this analysis relies on wetland ‘wetness’ during the growing season, but the proposed rule uses the ‘wet season,’” Gold said.

About the wet season, Gold continued, there are “fundamental issues with the proposed rule’s ‘wet season’ dataset.”

He said the classification of the “wet season” comes from the Army Corps of Engineers Antecedent Precipitation Tool, but the underlying data this tool relies on is modeled using the average monthly temperature and precipitation between 1950 and 1999. The modeled dataset was published in 2001 and does not use the best-available methods.

“The agencies proposed ‘wet season’ dataset classifies most of the year, and in some cases the entire year, as ‘wet’ for much of coastal North Carolina. So, under this proposed rule, wetlands or streams in Jacksonville would need to have surface water year-round (the whole year is classified as ‘wet’) to have Clean Water Act protections. For New Bern, the ‘wet season’ is 11 months, and for Wilmington or Brunswick County, the ‘wet season’ is 10 months.”

Gold said the proposed rule “which could essentially remove nontidal wetland and intermittent waters from the Clean Water Act, does not align with the goal of the Clean Water Act to ‘restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters.’ Science shows us that all wetlands, regardless of how ‘wet’ they are, clean our water, provide critical wildlife habitat, and reduce downstream flooding impacts.”

The EPA and Corps also asserted the week the proposed changes were announced that the new rules would provide “the regulatory certainty needed to support our nation’s farmers who feed and fuel the world and advance EPA’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative.”

Sabath noted that the idea that this will have huge benefits for farming and for farmers is a common refrain when they’re restricting the protections of the Clean Water Act, “but the Clean Water Act actually exempts most farming activities from coverage already, so you don’t need to get a permit for doing regular farming activities, even when they would affect a wetland or stream that would otherwise be covered.”

The idea that this is a huge benefit for farmers is a nicer story, “because they don’t want to say, well, this is a huge benefit for large industrial facilities, industrial polluters, developers,” Sabath said.

Carey sees the proposed rule as demonstrating “that the EPA has abdicated its mandated responsibility to protect the environment and the people who depend on it. Even worse, the agency appears eager to sacrifice our natural resources on the altar of corporate greed.”

The public should be “very concerned that the federal agency tasked with ensuring clean water, clean air, and the protection of our natural environment seems determined to undermine that responsibility. With this proposed change, the EPA claims to seek clarity in regulation, but this rule would serve only to allow industry to profit from environmental destruction, and the ruination of our natural resources,” she added.

White Oak Waterkeeper Riley Lewis said in a statement that the EPA’s new definition of Waters of the United States ignores decades of scientific understanding and generations of Indigenous knowledge.

“By redefining wetlands using ambiguous criteria seemingly designed to maximize developable land and reduce regulatory barriers, the agency is turning a blind eye to the very real, very predictable impacts on our communities,” Lewis said. “Water will continue to move beneath our feet through groundwater and across the landscape during storms, regardless of a federal definition or a construction permit. This rule sets Americans up for flooding, damaged infrastructure, and increased pollution in the waters we rely on for our drinking supply, our food, and our way of life.”

So, why does this actually matter to the public? Sabath said it does in a few ways.

In North Carolina, people who hunt, fish and paddle use wetlands directly and those might be impacted by being destroyed or polluted without a permit.

“Anyone who is in a community that floods during extreme weather, and we all know that that’s happening more and more now, or that’s at risk of flooding,” Sabath said. By losing those wetlands, you lose their ability to protect communities from flooding, and that comes more often now from extreme weather.

“It’s a double whammy. You’re losing the benefits that they provide, and you’re probably creating more problems,” and more potential pollution or channels of pollution at the same time by replacing wetlands, natural areas with pavement or developed areas, he said.

With wetlands being a “good natural sponge” that can absorb huge amounts of water, “if anything, we should be trying to expand wetland coverage rather than take it away, Sabath said.

“In short,” Carey with the Sierra Club continued, “communities will watch rivers and streams in their communities fall victim to unchecked pollution. Without federal protections, industry will discharge and develop at will, destroying habitats, water quality, and flood protection measures as they go. The wetlands and streams of this country belong to all people, not just those who seek to exploit them.”",https://coastalreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/brunswick-wetlands.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 04:58:39.290990

Whether through mass layoffs, targeted office closures, including environmental justice programs, or the rejection or rollback of regulation of key pollutants, the EPA is an agency being all but wound down, critics charge.

In July, the EPA said it was cutting nearly a billion dollars in funding from its own operations, claiming a few months later that states will fill expected regulatory gaps.

Yet many states—mostly those led by Republicans—were already dramatically defunding their own environmental enforcement operations, a new report from the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) finds.

Since 2010, lawmakers in Texas have reduced the budget for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) by 33 percent after adjusting for inflation, according to the EIP report released on Wednesday. TCEQ also now has to contend with 401 more facilities that need pollution regulation despite no increases to staff in over ten years.

“The funding cuts to TCEQ described in this report render the agency largely ineffective, and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness,” Kathryn Guerra, Public Citizen’s TCEQ campaign director and a former EPA and TCEQ employee, said in a press conference on Wednesday.

Mississippi has cut its own environmental regulatory agency by nearly 80 percent during that same time period.

Graphics via EIP report, “State of Decline: Cuts to State Pollution Control Agencies Compound Damage from the Dismantling of EPA.”

In Gulf states broadly, this abandoning of regulatory obligations to protect the environment and public health is happening against a backdrop of a massive buildout of liquefied natural gas export facilities.

In Texas, for instance, where most of the nation’s oil and gas exports now exit the nation, the TCEQ doesn’t have enough people to deal with the increasing amount of new oil and gas projects and those that are developing, report authors found. Nor can the agency regulate those that are violating their permits.

Of course, the Trump administration and Texas’s Republican leadership support the proliferation of these projects. Trump has latched onto fracked gas as a key aspect of his “unleashing American energy” agenda, which is solely directed at sustaining the oil and gas industry as renewables become more used globally.

In September 2024, the Texas Legislature approved 67 full-time positions for TCEQ’s budget for 2026 and 2027, along with $47.7 million in additional funding. But the regulator had asked for 157 positions and $60 million dollars to keep up with the state’s growth. The EIP report authors note that these increases don’t significantly change the “long term trend” of TCEQ’s budget.

“It really means that there are less people on the ground to ensure that companies are following the law,” Jen Duggan, EIP’s executive director, said on a press call rolling out the report on Wednesday. “It may take longer, once a violation is identified, to actually resolve that violation and bring that company back into compliance with the law.”

Residents near these projects find themselves filling in for missing regulators by necessity, documenting apparent violations and filing reports for investigations that frequently never follow,as seen with liquified natural gas (LNG) export plants in Louisiana. In October, EIP released a report detailing that every operating LNG plant–7 in all–in the United States had violated their air permits at least once in the last five years. Five of them had also violated their water permits.

“Proactive investigations and the oversight responsibility ultimately falls to the community and that should never be the case,” Guerra said.

LNG export plants are not the only things that are facing less regulatory attention. Last month, the Trump administration also directed the EPA to lessen its standards for soot pollution, wetland and threatened species protections.

This year the EPA announced it was cutting nearly 4,000 positions from the agency. Some of the agency’s departing researchers have gone into the private sector, creating a “brain drain” from the EPA that was critical in responding to environmental disasters like the 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.",https://d3l0i86vhnepo5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/11115507/p8IRBMTg.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:42.383609

WEINHEIM, Germany, December 12, 2025 (EZ Newswire) -- Green Energy Origin (GEO), a thriving force in the field of electrolyte manufacturing and a leading developer of next-generation battery materials, today announced that it will acquire electrolyte manufacturing assets from subsidiaries of Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC) in the United States and the United Kingdom. As demand for electrolytes continues to surge amid the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESS), GEO’s expanded production footprint is expected to reshape the competitive landscape in the field.

GEO shared it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire MCC’s electrolyte production facilities in both countries. The deal follows the completion and startup in 2024 of GEO’s 200,000-ton-per-year electrolyte plant in the Czech Republic, and will enable the company to immediately provide additional production capacity and supply redundancies across North America and Western Europe and further strengthen global R&D and patent collaboration, contributing jointly to a low-carbon future.

The Memphis, TN facility acquired from MCC will allow GEO to immediately begin supplying product in the U.S. Midwest, where many battery customers are located, effectively accelerating GEO’s market expansion into the U.S. by two to three years. The Billingham plant in the U.K. — the U.K.’s only electrolyte production facility — provides GEO with a strategically important manufacturing foothold in Western Europe. This secures key capacity in Western Europe and enables GEO to deliver its products to customers within 4–6 hours.

The transaction reflects the mutual long-term perspective shared by MCC and GEO, strengthening not only their strategic alignment but also their partnership outlook.0

“By acquiring MCC’s manufacturing facilities, GEO will further enhance their ability to deliver rapid and reliable supply across North America and Europe,” said Tony Ma, CEO of GEO. “Additionally, GEO will deepen its partnerships with strategic customers by developing regionally integrated supply chains for electrolyte raw materials and remain committed to delivering the best products and services to our customers while contributing to a low-carbon future.”

(WANE) — A public forum to discuss the newly operational Google data center opened the conversation to the general public on Thursday evening to shed light on everything the data center will bring to the area.

“This is an opportunity for us to hit the reset button, quite frankly, in our relationship with the community,” Broderick Green, Public Affairs Manager for Google, said. ‘This is a long time coming, quite frankly, it’s long overdue.”

Google announced Thursday morning that the first installment of the data center is officially operational, and detailed its plans for the community ahead of the evening’s public forum.

Representatives from Google, Indiana Michigan Power, City of Fort Wayne Utilities, and Greater Fort Wayne Inc. held the forum at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne. Each entity came equipped with presentations with the intention of providing more information on the data center.

Google touched on similar topics that appeared in a press release, emphasizing community outreach and engagement. It also revealed to many that this operational data center is the first of three on its campus, with the second and third well on the way. Google detailed its objectives for its energy usage and pledged to replenish 120% of its water use as well.

In the presentation, the slide read, “Google will replenish 120% of the water we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers. We’ll focus our efforts in water scarce regions to support those who need it most. Peer reviewed water risk framework to establish responsible water use guardrails. Our approach to cooling is ‘localized’ selecting the best technology based on location specific attributes and minimizing climate impacts.”

Representatives also explained the Hatchworks Air Permit Requirements, where the initial request for a permit from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) included just 34 generators, but the current permit modification includes 179 generators. The presentation notes that these emergency backup generators “only use a fraction of the permitted emissions limit,” and that these generators are solely for emergency use, yearly maintenance, and limited other needs.

Sarah Hoffman, a representative of Google for Environmental Compliance, said, that these generators are “permitted for only emergency use. We do not run them for anything else. They are not run 24/7, as the questions been asked multiple times.”

“We run them only for maintenance that’s required. We have to run them for maintenance to ensure that they’re going to operate if we do have a power outage, and that backup power.”

Ashley Savieo, Director of Economic Development at Indiana Michigan Power, noted that although the data center operating in Fort Wayne is considered a “large load” customer, residents in the area will not feel any impacts or pay for any additional power usage. In fact, users can expect to see rates go down over time.

“Indiana Michigan Power has ample capacity to serve Google while also continuing to provide reliable service to our over 600,000 customers across Indiana and Michigan,” she said. “So large users like Google actually help stabilize costs by spreading the fixed costs of operating and maintaining our system across a larger customer base, we create downward pressure on rates over time.”

Savieo mentioned that I&M and Google have entered an agreement to protect their user base from dramatic cost shifts if Google were to halt operations in Fort Wayne. She delved into detail in her presentation on the industrial tariff rates that have been placed on Google, ensuring that residents would not be impacted.

“If Google were to leave unexpectedly, safeguards and penalties are in place that prevent those costs from being shifted onto other customers. So to be clear, Google is not receiving any rate discounts from Indiana Michigan Power. They pay the same industrial tariff rates as any industrial customer would, that is, on our system today.”

Savieo detailed that data centers do not cause blackouts in their communities, and that I&M is positive that the grid has adequate capacity.

“We hear your concerns, and they do matter to us,” said Savieo, “Many of our employees right here in Fort Wayne, they’re your neighbors.”

The City of Fort Wayne Utilities Deputy Director Matthew Wirtz echoed Savieo’s remarks, saying that the utilitarian costs of the Google data center would not negatively impact citizens. In fact, having a large utility user like Google could, over time, decrease the rates that residents pay.

“Adding large users provides downward pressure, additional revenue for our system, and thus helping us keep rates down for everybody. Just as an example, the top 10 water users or customers for Fort Wayne seated utilities, they pay 10% of our water revenue. So, 10 customers paid 10% we have 110,000 customers, 10 of them are paying for 10% of the water revenue of our system.”

Wirtz also noted that Google does not, and will not be charged a special rate, and will pay similarly to any other industrial resident.

Green explained that Google is not just operating in Fort Wayne, but wants to invest in the community.

Green said, “We now operate here. It isn’t a matter of being some sort of an outsider moving in. We want to become integrated into what’s going on on a day-to-day basis in any community that we’re operating in. Fort Wayne is no different.”

Green showed that Google plans to work with and support organizations such as Fort Wayne Early Learning Center, Amani Family Services, Fort Wayne Urban League, Ivy Tech Community College, Fort Wayne Blue Jackets, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, and many more. Green stated that Google wants to invest in schools and learning workforce programs, including East Allen County Schools (EACS) and Fort Wayne Community Schools (FWCS), as well as the Skilled Trades and Readiness (STAR) program, AI Fellowship for Community Changemakers, and partnerships with Ivy Tech.

City of Fort Wayne Community Development Director Jonathon Leist announced that millions of dollars would be reinvested into the community, saying that “all of these funds are available because of the data center.” Leist outlined that $2 million has been committed by Fort Wayne Redevelopment Commission to expand early childcare services, $4 million in land sales has been pledged to the Connected Neighborhoods Initiative, $2 million in land sales is pledged to the design of new park spaces at the former Pepsi Distribution Center on the Riverfront, and TIF revenue will support an annual grants to EACS over the next 25 years.

Despite the hours-long presentation, many citizens who attended remain apprehensive of the data center, and many disapprove of it altogether.

Debera Kuntz, a concerned citizen, said, “These platforms that they’re trying to give us. It just seems more of a method to placate everyone than to actually answer questions or try to do anything like with the diesel generators. We asked, Can you do something more sustainable? And it just felt like the answer was, No.”

Another citizen, Danielle Doepke, shared, “I don’t think it’s sufficient. I don’t think it’s good enough. Most of the time was dedicated to presentations that really didn’t give us a lot of detailed information into how they’re going to do, the things that they say they’re going to do.”",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/12/Google-data-center-forum.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-12 00:58:11.258146

Case Background American Efficient is a distributed energy efficiency resources aggregator that participated in capacity auctions in PJM and MISO.
American Efficient argued that FERC's enforcement proceedings are substantially similar to the SEC's proceedings in Jarkesy, and that assessment of a civil penalty in proceedings before the agency would violate American Efficient's right to a jury trial.
While the district court agreed that FERC enforcement actions implicate the right to a trial by jury,7 it ruled that FERC's procedures are critically distinct from those in Jarkesy and satisfy constitutional requirements.
The District Court rejected that argument, citing recent precedents from the FCC context and reasoning that because no final legal rights are determined or payments awarded before the district court litigation takes place, there is no violation of the company's Seventh Amendment rights.","On November 24, 2025, a federal district court judge for the Middle District of North Carolina denied American Efficient's motion for a preliminary injunction preventing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from holding the company liable for nearly $1 billion, including over $700 million in civil penalties. The case, American Efficient LLC v. FERC,1 addresses whether FERC's process for assessing and enforcing penalties for alleged violations of the Federal Power Act (FPA) conflicts with the Seventh Amendment and Article III of the Constitution. On a motion for preliminary injunction, the district court ruled2 that this enforcement framework likely does not violate the company's constitutional right to a jury trial, because the statute allows for de novo judicial review before any penalty can be enforced against the company, including de novo review by the court of any facts found by the agency. The district court case now proceeds toward a final ruling on the merits of American Efficient's constitutional claims.3 The administrative proceeding before FERC, which was not stayed during the district court litigation, also continues. The next step is for the Commission to issue its order deciding whether to impose civil penalties or other remedies against American Efficient.

Though not the final say on the matter, for now, the district court's ruling means that FERC enforcement proceedings under the FPA can move forward under the current procedural framework, reducing litigation risk to the agency.4 Notably, the district court rejected American Efficient's argument that its constitutional rights are effectively undermined by first having to undergo a lengthy administrative proceeding before the opportunity for a jury trial arises. While the court's ruling on this issue appears supported by analogous precedents, it is not binding on other courts. In light of recent decisions from the Supreme Court that have tended to narrow agency authority, it is possible other courts might be more receptive to similar arguments. And as discussed further below, the district court did not address American Efficient's additional constitutional challenge to FERC's structure as an independent agency, an issue that will almost certainly be impacted by litigation involving a recently terminated Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner that is currently before the Supreme Court.

Case Background

American Efficient is a distributed energy efficiency resources aggregator that participated in capacity auctions in PJM and MISO. Following a three-year investigation, in December 2024, FERC issued an Order to Show Cause, alleging that American Efficient engaged in market manipulation and violated the terms of the PJM and MISO tariffs and directing the company to show cause why it should not be liable for $722 million in civil penalties and disgorgement of over $250 million in unjust profits.

In response to the Order, American Efficient filed a complaint and concurrent motion for preliminary injunction, alleging that FERC's Order and the proceedings against American Efficient violate the Seventh Amendment and Article III of the Constitution.

SEC v. Jarkesy and Jury Trial Rights in Enforcement Actions for Civil Penalties

American Efficient argued that FERC's enforcement proceedings run afoul of the U.S. Supreme Court's June 2024 ruling in SEC v. Jarkesy.5Jarkesy, which we previously discussed here,6 held that the SEC's adjudication of enforcement actions before in-house administrative law judges (ALJs) violated Jarkesy's right to a jury trial and separation-of-powers principles. Key to the reasoning in Jarkesy was that securities fraud enforcement actions resemble traditional common law claims (fraud), and that the civil penalties the SEC sought to impose were punitive in nature, a type of remedy traditionally available only in courts of law (as opposed to equity or admiralty courts). Jarkesy held that the Constitution prohibits Congress and agencies from forcing defendants to submit to adjudication of this kind of case outside of the Article III courts and without the opportunity for a trial by jury.

American Efficient argued that FERC's enforcement proceedings are substantially similar to the SEC's proceedings in Jarkesy, and that assessment of a civil penalty in proceedings before the agency would violate American Efficient's right to a jury trial.

While the district court agreed that FERC enforcement actions implicate the right to a trial by jury,7 it ruled that FERC's procedures are critically distinct from those in Jarkesy and satisfy constitutional requirements. As provided by statute,8 when FERC seeks to assess a civil penalty for alleged violations under the Federal Power Act (FPA),9 it must provide notice to the subject of that penalty, who may then choose whether to proceed to an initial adjudication before an ALJ, or instead elect an ""accelerated"" proceeding directly before the Commission. Under the latter option, if FERC ultimately imposes a penalty, the subject can force FERC to initiate litigation in federal district court to enforce the penalty. FERC's decision assessing the civil penalty is then subject to full de novo judicial review, including fact-finding by the court and a trial by jury. The court held these procedures sufficient to satisfy American Efficient's right to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment.

American Efficient argued that these procedures were not constitutionally sufficient, because in order to get a jury trial, the company first had to participate in costly and time-consuming agency proceedings, wait until FERC issues a civil penalty order, and then wait further for FERC to initiate judicial proceedings to enforce that order—a process that can potentially take years. The District Court rejected that argument, citing recent precedents from the FCC context and reasoning that because no final legal rights are determined or payments awarded before the district court litigation takes place, there is no violation of the company's Seventh Amendment rights.

Lingering Question About FERC's Structure as an Independent Agency

Though not addressed by the court's ruling on the preliminary injunction, American Efficient's complaint also challenges the structure of FERC itself, arguing that statutory removal protections for FERC Commissioners violate the separation of powers and Article II of the Constitution. This claim parallels recent litigation involving the Trump administration's terminations of heads of other independent agencies without cause, and the continued vitality (or not) of the Supreme Court's 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, which Steptoe has previously written about here.10 In Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court affirmed limits on the President's power to remove Commissioners of the FTC, which Congress established as an independent agency.

Like the FTC, FERC is structured as an independent agency: by law, its Commissioners serve staggered, five-year terms, and no more than three Commissioners may belong to a single political party. The President's termination of former FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter is currently being challenged before the Supreme Court in Trump v. Slaughter. Whether Humphrey's Executor remains good law is squarely at issue in that case, as Steptoe has previously discussed here.11 Proponents of maintaining the independent structure of agencies such as FERC argue that it provides a measure of insulation from day-to-day political pressures and fosters stability and continuity.12 The scope of the Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. Slaughter could have significant implications for FERC's continued status as an independent agency. Oral argument in the case took place on December 8, 2025.

2. Because of the procedural posture of the case (disposition of American Efficient's motion for a preliminary injunction), the court's ruling addressed only whether American Efficient was likely to succeed on its claim, and technically is not a final and conclusive decision on the merits of the constitutional argument.

3. American Efficient may also seek to immediately appeal the district court's denial of its motion for preliminary injunction.

7. Like the securities fraud claim in Jarkesy, the District Court found that FERC's market manipulation claims resemble a traditional common law action for fraud, and that FERC's civil penalties are a punitive remedy traditionally available only in courts of law. The court also rejected an intervenor's argument that FERC's claim for tariff violations was a creature of the regulatory regime that had no common law analog and fell within the limited ""public rights"" exception to the jury trial right discussed in Jarkesy. Instead, the court found that the alleged tariff violations resemble traditional common law actions for breach of contract.

8. 16 U.S.C. § 823b(d)(1)-(3); 16 U.S.C. § 825o-1(b).

9. American Efficient involved alleged violations of the FPA. Enforcement proceedings for violations of the NGA operate under a different statutory framework, and FERC has previously taken the position that in light of the statute's silence, de novo judicial review is not available in such proceedings. Statement of Administrative Policy Regarding the Process for Assessing Civil Penalties, 117 FERC ¶ 61,317, at PP 6-7 (2006). This issue came to a head in post-Jarkesy litigation in a long-running NGA enforcement proceeding in Total Gas & Power North America, Inc., 188 FERC ¶ 61,197 at PP 5-6 (2024). There, FERC issued an order holding the proceedings in abeyance, declaring that FERC would not subject Total to any penalties on the basis of administrative proceedings before an ALJ and stating that FERC would be assessing its enforcement procedures in light of Jarkesy. (FERC subsequently settled the case for a fraction of the penalty amount in its original Order to Show Cause.) We are not aware of any pronouncement to date by the Commission regarding changes to enforcement procedures under the NGA to comply with Jarkesy, and it is possible new legislation would be required to enact any such changes.

The county health worker scanned the Omaha home with an X-ray gun, searching for the poison.

It was 2022, and doctors had recently found high levels of lead in the blood of Crystalyn Prine’s 2-year-old son, prompting the Douglas County Health Department to investigate. The worker said it didn’t seem to come from the walls, where any lead would be buried under layers of smooth paint. The lead assessor swabbed the floors for dust but didn’t find answers as to how Prine’s son had been exposed.

A danger did lurk outside, the worker told her. For more than a century, a smelter and other factories had spewed lead-laced smoke across the city’s east side, leading the federal government to declare a huge swath of Omaha a Superfund site and to dig up and replace nearly 14,000 yards — including about a third of the east side’s residential properties — since 1999.

Prine looked up the soil tests for her home online and discovered her yard contained potentially harmful levels of lead. But when she called the city, officials told her that her home didn’t qualify for government-funded cleanup under the standard in place from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Prine didn’t want to move out of the home that had been in her husband’s family for generations. So she followed the county’s advice to keep her five kids safe. They washed their hands frequently and took off their shoes when they came inside.

Then, Prine heard some news at the clinic where she worked as a nurse that gave her hope: In January 2024, the EPA under President Joe Biden lowered the lead levels that could trigger cleanup. Her home was above the new threshold.

That didn’t automatically mean her yard would be cleaned up, local officials told her, but last year, the EPA began to study the possibility of cleaning up tens of thousands of more yards in Omaha, according to emails and other records obtained by the Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica. The agency was also discussing with local officials whether to expand the cleanup area to other parts of Omaha and its surrounding suburbs.

Then, this October, the Trump administration rolled back the Biden administration’s guidance. In doing so, it tripled the amount of lead that had to be in the soil to warrant a potential cleanup, meaning that Prine and other families might again be out of luck.

Prine’s son Jack, now 5, struggles to speak. He talks less than his 2-year-old brother and stumbles over five-word sentences.

“You would think that if lead is this impactful on a small child, that you would definitely want to be fixing it,” she said. “What do you do as a parent? I don’t want to keep my kid from playing outside. He loves playing outside, and I should be able to do that in my own yard.”

Scientists have long agreed about the dangers of lead. The toxic metal can get into kids’ brains and nervous systems, causing IQ loss and developmental delays. Experts say the Trump administration’s guidance runs counter to decades of research: In the 26 years since the government began to clean up east Omaha — the largest residential lead Superfund site in the country — scientists have found harm at ever lower levels of exposure.

Yet what gets cleaned up is often not just a matter of science but also money and government priorities, according to experts who have studied the Superfund program.

Prine’s block illustrates how widespread Omaha’s lead problem is and how many people who might have benefited from the Biden guidance may no longer get relief. Of the 11 homes on her block, four were cleaned up by the EPA. Six others tested below the original cleanup standard but above the levels in the Biden guidance and were never remediated.

The Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica are embarking on a yearlong project about Omaha’s lead legacy, including testing soil to find out how effective the cleanup has been. If you live in or near the affected area, you can sign up for free lead testing of your soil.

Despite the changing guidance, Omaha still follows a cleanup standard set in 2009: Properties qualify for cleanup if parts of the yard have more than 400 parts per million of lead in the soil — the equivalent of a marble in a 10-pound bucket of dirt. The Biden administration lowered the guidance for so-called removal management levels to 200 parts per million.

The Trump administration has said its new guidance, which raised them to 600 parts per million, would speed cleanups by providing clearer direction and streamlining investigations of contaminated sites. But environmental advocates said it only accelerates project completion by cleaning up fewer properties.

The EPA disputed that. “Protecting communities from lead exposure at contaminated sites is EPA’s statutory responsibility and a top priority for the Trump EPA,” the agency said in a statement. “The criticism that our Residential Soil Lead Directive will result in EPA doing less is false.”

The new guidance doesn’t necessarily scrap the hopes of Omaha homeowners or the conversations that were happening around the Biden recommendations. That’s because the Trump administration continues to allow EPA managers to study properties with lower levels of lead, depending on how widespread the contamination is and how likely people are to be harmed. What actually gets cleaned up is decided by local EPA officials, who can set remediation levels higher or lower based on the circumstances of specific sites.

Regional EPA spokesperson Kellen Ashford said the agency is continuing to assess the Omaha site and will meet with local and state leaders to “chart a path forward with how the updated residential lead directive may apply.”

Gabriel Filippelli, executive director of Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute, has studied lead and Superfund sites for decades and said he is doubtful the EPA will spend the money to clean up more yards in Omaha. The EPA doesn’t act if “you don’t have local people raising alarm bells,” he said.

Yet in Omaha, many are unaware of the debate — or even the presence of lead in their yards. Most of the cleanup happened more than a decade ago. As years passed, new people moved in, and younger residents never learned about the site. Others who did know assumed the lead problem was solved. The dustup around lead has mostly settled even if much of the toxic metal in the city’s dirt never left.

‘Mass poison’

When Prine moved into Omaha’s Field Club neighborhood in 2018, she loved the Queen Anne and Victorian-style homes that lined shady boulevards and how her neighbors decorated heavily for Halloween and Christmas.

While she had visited the home previously to see her husband’s family, Prine had no idea her neighborhood was in the middle of a massive environmental cleanup.

“The first time I heard about it was when my son had an elevated blood-lead level,” she said.

From 1870 to 1997, the American Smelting and Refining Company sat on the Missouri River in downtown Omaha, melting and refining so much lead to make batteries, cover cables and enrich gasoline that it was once the largest operation in the country, according to a 1949 newspaper article.

By the 1970s, researchers had proven lead was poisoning American children. Doctors in Omaha noticed kids with elevated blood-lead levels and published findings connecting the toxic metal in their bodies to the smoke pouring out of ASARCO and other polluters.

In the late 1990s, when city leaders wanted to demolish ASARCO and redevelop the site into a riverfront park, they had to figure out how to clean up Omaha’s lead legacy. They turned to the EPA, which declared a 27-square-mile swath of east Omaha a Superfund site, a federal designation that would allow the agency to clean up the contamination and try to hold the polluters responsible to pay for it.

The agency estimated the smelter, along with other polluters, had spewed about 400 million pounds of lead dust over an area, where 125,000 people, including 14,000 young children, lived.

The EPA won $246 million in settlements from ASARCO and others to fund the cleanup.

By 2015, most of the yards that tested above 400 parts per million had their soil replaced, and the EPA handed the remaining work to the city. The old smelter site was redeveloped into a science museum with a playground outside.

The project seemed like a success. The number of kids testing high for lead has dropped dramatically since the 1990s, though similar patterns exist nationwide and fewer than half the kids in the site are tested annually, according to data from the Douglas County Health Department.

But evidence had already been emerging that the cleanup levels the EPA had set in Omaha “may not protect children,” which the agency acknowledged in 2019, during the first Trump administration. Managers wrote in a site review that “increasing evidence supports a lower blood-lead level of concern” than the 1994 health guidance that informed the cleanup plan.

Lead, even in incredibly small amounts, can build up in the brains, bones or organs of children as well as adults, said Bruce Lanphear, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada who has studied lead for decades.

“Lead represents the largest mass poison in human history,” he said.

After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lowered its blood-lead level standard, the EPA’s Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation began working on new lead cleanup guidance for the EPA regions in 2012, said James Woolford, director of the office from 2006 to 2020. The EPA took a “cautious, studied” approach to how much lead in dirt is acceptable.

“Zero was obviously the preference. But what could you do given what’s in the environment?” he asked. “And so we were kind of stuck there.”

Then, in 2024, Biden stepped in.

If regional EPA officials applied the administration’s guidance to the Omaha site, over 13,000 more properties in Omaha could have qualified, a Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica analysis of EPA and City of Omaha soil tests found.

The number could have been even higher, records show. Nearly 27,000 properties, including those that never received cleanup and those that received partial cleanup, would have been eligible for further evaluation, EPA manager Preston Law wrote to a state environmental official in March 2024.

The EPA had also been discussing with city and state officials whether to expand the cleanup area: A map that an EPA contractor created with a computer model to simulate the smelter’s plume shows that it likely stretched 23 miles north to south across five counties in Nebraska and Iowa.

But cleaning up all the properties to the Biden levels could cost more than $800 million, the then-interim director of the Nebraska Department of Energy and Environment, Thaddeus Fineran, wrote to the EPA’s administrator in May 2024.

If cleanup costs exceeded the funds set aside from Omaha’s settlements, the EPA would have to dip into the federal Superfund trust fund, which generally requires a 10% match from the state, said Ashford, the EPA spokesperson.

That could mean a contribution of $80 million or more from Nebraska, which is already facing a $471 million budget deficit. In the letter, Fineran wrote that the state would “reserve the right to challenge the Updated Lead Soil Guidance and any actions taken in furtherance thereof.”

The Nebraska Department of Water, Energy, and Environment, as the agency is now called, declined an interview, referring questions to the EPA.

Researchers and decision-makers are likely taking a cautious approach toward what they agree to clean up in Omaha, Woolford said. Given its size, it could carry weight elsewhere.

“It will set the baseline for sites across the country,” he said.

‘Hollow’ claims

The Trump administration may upend any plans to expand the cleanup.

In March, the EPA announced what it called the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.” By July, about 1 in 5 employees who worked for the EPA when Trump took office were gone. The administration proposed slashing the EPA’s budget in half.

The administration promised to prioritize Superfund cleanups. But in October, it changed the lead guidance. As a result, more people will be at risk of absorbing damaging amounts of lead into their bodies, said Tom Neltner, national director for the advocacy organization Unleaded Kids.

“It signals that the claims that lead is a priority for them are hollow,” he said.

The Trump administration said Biden’s approach had “inconsistencies and inefficiencies” that led to “analysis paralysis” and slowed projects down.

“Children can’t wait years for us to put a shovel in the dirt to clean up the areas where they live and play,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

Under the guidance, the EPA could issue a lower standard for the Omaha site. But Robert Weinstock, director of Northwestern University’s Environmental Advocacy Center, said that’s unlikely unless the state sets a lower state standard than the EPA.

Trump’s guidance has some advantages in being more clear, said Filippelli of Indiana University. The Biden guidance seemed overly ambitious: Filippelli and other researchers estimated 1 in 4 American homes could have qualified for cleanup with an estimated cost of $290 billion to $1.2 trillion.

While Omaha could be the litmus test for how low the Trump EPA is willing to set cleanup standards, the new guidelines don’t inspire confidence that the administration will do more to clean up old sites where work is nearly finished.

“I imagine the inertia would be just to say, ‘Oh, we’re done with Omaha,’” he said.

The city has received no timeline from the EPA, said Steve Zivny, program manager of Omaha’s Lead Information Office. He’s guessing money will play a big part in the decision over whether to clean up at a lower lead level, though. About $90 million of the Omaha Superfund settlement remains.

“If the data is there and the science is there and the money’s there, I think we would expect it to be lowered,” Zivny said. “But there’s just so many factors that are not really in our control.”

If cleanup levels aren’t lowered in Omaha, advocates will have more work to do, said Kiley Petersmith, an assistant professor at Nebraska Methodist College who until recently oversaw a statewide blood-lead testing program.

“I think we’re just gonna have to rally together to do more to prevent it from getting from our environment into our kids,” she said.

A buried issue

Despite the cleanup efforts, Omahans are still exposed at higher rates compared with the national average, said Dr. Egg Qin, an epidemiologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who has studied the Superfund site. Yet the city seems to be moving on, he said.

“Somebody needs to take the responsibility,” Qin said, “to make sure the community knows lead poisoning still exists significantly in Omaha.”

About 40% of the 398 people who have already signed up to have their soil tested by Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica said they did not feel knowledgeable about the history of lead contamination in Omaha.

That may in part be due to disclosure rules. When a person sells a home, state and federal law requires them to share any knowledge about lead hazards. The EPA’s original cleanup plan from 2009 says that should include providing buyers with soil test results.

But in most cases, there can be very little disclosure, said Tim Reeder, a real estate agent who works in the Superfund site. Omaha’s association of real estate agents provides a map of the Superfund site to give to buyers, along with some basic information, if the home is within the boundaries.

City and local health officials spread the word about lead through neighborhood meetings, local TV interviews and billboards. But most people don’t take it seriously until someone they know tests high, Petersmith said.

“Unfortunately, once it affects them personally, like if their child or grandchild or cousin has lead exposure, then it’s too late,” she said.

When Omaha pediatrician Katie MacKrell moved into a house in the Dundee neighborhood, she thought her kids were fine to play in the yard. Her son sucked his thumb. Her daughter dropped her pacifier and put it back in.

When their kids both tested high for lead, MacKrell and her husband went to work fixing lead paint issues in the house. When it came to the yard, her property tested for lead levels above the Biden guidance but didn’t qualify under the original cleanup threshold. And without government help, it could cost the couple more than $10,000 to pay for the remediation themselves.

The lead also caught Vanessa Ballard, a high school teacher and mom of two young boys, by surprise. She had imagined growing fruit trees in her backyard until she discovered lead levels high enough to potentially clean up under the Biden guidelines. Now, no one goes in the backyard. Her oldest son splashes in soapy water after making tracks for his Hot Wheels cars in the dirt, and she mixes droplets of iron with the kids’ juice every night to help their bodies repel lead.

“I have no hand in the cause of this, but I have all the responsibility in the prevention of it harming me and my family,” she said.

Prine will never know whether lead stunted Jack’s speech development, but she worries about it every day.

Starting kindergarten helped. But her son is still behind other kids. Prine said she tries to put on a brave face, to believe one day he’ll catch up. If he doesn’t, it’s hard not to suspect the culprit could be in her soil.

It seemed the government, at least for a short while, agreed. Now she, and so many others in Omaha, don’t know when, if ever, to expect a solution.

“Why does it take so long, when they say it’s not safe, to then come in and say, ‘We’re gonna take this seriously?’” Prine asked. “‘That we’re gonna help these kids and protect them?’”",https://flatwaterfreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251116-Gratz-NE-Lead14-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 01:57:55.868104

Listen to the interview Listen 15:18 LA Mayor Karen Bass calls for allocating more money to police department hiring Hermon just got its first sit-down restaurant.","Los Angeles could become the first city in the U.S. to ban ink cartridges that can be used only once.

The L.A. City Council unanimously voted Wednesday to approve the creation of an ordinance that prohibits their sale. The move comes after more than a year of debate over the terms.

Why the potential ban

This builds upon the city’s effort to reach zero waste, including phasing out single-use plastics. You’re likely familiar with some of those efforts — such as only getting plastic foodware by request and banning single-use carryout bags at stores. Multiple plastic bans have been suggested, like for single-use vapes and bag clips, but now it’s ink’s turn.

The cartridges are tough to dispose of because of the plastic, metal and chemicals inside, according to the city. They’re also classified as regulated waste in the state because they can leach toxic substances into the environment, such as volatile organic compounds and heavy metals.

That poses a problem. L.A.’s curbside recycling program can’t recycle the cartridges, and while its hazardous waste program can take them, a significant portion end up in landfills.

Major printer manufacturers and some ink retailers have take-back programs for used cartridges so they can get refilled. However, L.A. Sanitation says there are certain single-use cartridges that don’t have recovery programs. These are usually cartridges that work with a printer but aren’t name brand.

How outlawing them could work

LASAN has spent months figuring out what a ban would cover — and it hasn’t been without pushback. The city’s energy and environment committee pressed the department back in September on how effective a ban would be.

Ultimately, the committee moved it forward with a promise that LASAN would come back with more details, including environmental groups’ stance, concrete data to back up the need and a public education plan.

The department’s current recommendation is that the ordinance should prohibit retail and online establishments from selling any single-use ink cartridge, whether sold separately or with a printer, to people in the city. Retailers that don’t follow the rules would get fined.

So what does single-use mean here? The ban would affect a printer cartridge that:

is not collected or recovered through a take-back program

cannot be remanufactured, refilled or reused

infringes upon intellectual property rights or violates any applicable local, state or federal law

Any cartridges that meet one of these points would fall under the ban, though you still could get them outside L.A.

The proposed ordinance will go to the committee first while LASAN works on a public education plan.

If it ends up getting approved by the full council, the ban likely would go into full effect 12 months later.

The Trump administration is seeking to challenge state laws regulating the artificial intelligence industry, according to an executive order the president signed Thursday.

The order directs the Justice Department to set up an ""AI Litigation Task Force"" to sue states over their AI-related laws and also directs the the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission to work with the DOJ to follow the White House's AI action plan to circumvent ""onerous"" state and local regulations.

The order also directs Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to study whether the department can withhold federal rural broadband funding from states with unfavorable AI laws.

""We have to be unified,"" said President Donald Trump. ""China is unified because they have one vote, that's President Xi. He says do it, and that's the end of that.""

Trump's AI advisor, venture capitalist David Sacks, said the administration will not push back on all state laws.

""Kid safety, we're going to protect,"" Sacks said. ""We're not pushing back on that, but we're going to push back on the most onerous examples of state regulations""

The executive order is almost certain to be challenged in court and tech policy researchers say the Trump administration cannot restrict state regulation in this way without Congress passing a law. The order also directs Sacks to work with Congress to help draft legislation.

Trump's executive order drew criticism from some of his supporters, including organizations that are part of a bipartisan effort to pass laws protecting children from AI harms.

""This is a huge lost opportunity by the Trump administration to lead the Republican Party into a broadly consultative process,"" said Michael Toscano, director of the Family First Technology Initiative at the Institute for Family Studies, a conservative think tank. ""It doesn't make sense for a populist movement to cut out the people on the most critical issue of our day. But nonetheless, that is what they are vigorously trying to do.""

""Even if everything is overturned in the executive order, the chilling effect on states' willingness to protect their residents is going to be huge because they're all now going to fear getting attacked directly by the Trump administration,"" said Adam Billen, vice president of Encode, a nonprofit focused on child safety and threats posed by AI. ""That is the point of all of this — it is to create massive legal uncertainty and gray areas and give the companies the chance to do whatever they want.""

Sacks can recommend some state laws, such as around child safety, to not be challenged if Congress does come up with a national policy for AI.

While Congress has stalled on passing AI regulation, dozens of states have passed laws related to AI, which include banning creating nonconsensual nude images using AI technology, mandating government agencies and businesses to disclose AI usage, requiring checks for algorithmic discrimination and protecting whistleblowers.

The Trump administration has pushed for less regulation of the AI industry, citing competitive pressure with China. But Trump has also recently allowed chipmaker Nvidia to sell its second-most advanced AI chips to China. Depending on the quantity, said Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute who studies U.S.-China competition, the export could end up ""diluting what is our most significant advantage in the AI race.""

Trump and some of his allies have attempted multiple times this year to halt state-level AI regulation. Earlier this month, GOP lawmakers tried and failed to insert AI preemption into the annual defense spending bill. An earlier version of the executive order signed Thursday leaked last month, sparked a round of opposition from across the political spectrum. In July, the Senate dropped an AI moratorium from the reconciliation bill it was debating.

While Democrats broadly support more AI regulation, the issue has divided Republicans. A faction of the party, including the president, welcome the support of tech billionaires, though others continue to view them with distrust.

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, an industry ally, introduced the failed AI moratorium during the reconciliation bill debate and stood next to Trump at a signing ceremony for the order on Thursday. After the effort to slip a similar measure in the defense spending bill failed last week, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri posted on X, ""This is a terrible provision and should remain OUT.""

Many Republican governors are also opposed to the move. Earlier in the day, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox posted on X that he preferred an alternative executive order that did not include barring state laws. ""States must help protect children and families while America accelerates its leadership in AI,"" he wrote.

""An executive order doesn't/can't preempt state legislative action,"" posted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on X Monday in response to Trump's Truth Social post announcing the upcoming order, ""Congress could, theoretically, preempt states through legislation."" DeSantis has recently proposed a series of AI-related measures.

John Bergmayer, the legal director of the nonprofit advocacy group Public Knowledge, agreed. ""They're trying to find a way to bypass Congress with these various theories in the executive order. Legally, I don't think they work very well.""

In a post on X on Tuesday, Sacks suggested that the federal government can override state AI laws because it has the power to regulate interstate commerce.

Bergmayer disagreed, ""States are, in fact, allowed to regulate interstate commerce. They do it all the time. And the Supreme Court just recently said it was fine.""

Bergmayer cited a 2023 Supreme Court decision where the court supported California's power to regulate its pork industry even though the regulations affected farmers in other states.

NPR's Bobby Allyn contributed reporting.

Hundreds of people gathered at a cemetery in Boyle Heights Thursday to honor more than 2,300 Angelenos whose bodies have not been claimed by loved ones.

Officials say it was the highest number of people laid to rest during the annual Ceremony of the Unclaimed Dead over the past 45 years.

The remains were those of adults and children, some of whom had experienced homelessness, and who were immigrants far from home. Several of the people had struggled with physical and mental illnesses.

All of them died in 2022, about two years into the COVID-19 pandemic. The bodies were cremated and placed in a communal grave ahead of the ceremony, which has been a county tradition since 1896.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn said the unclaimed Angelenos may be strangers to those observing the ceremony, but they were our neighbors, too.

“They may have walked the same streets we did, waited at the same bus stops, enjoyed the same warm sunny days, even ones in mid-December like today,” Hahn said during the ceremony. “Like all of us, they hoped, they hurt, they dreamed — and too many endured more suffering and loneliness than anyone should.”

Inside the ceremony

Local faith leaders presided over the roughly hour-long event, sharing prayers and blessings to reflect the cultural and religious diversity of the region.

They included a Native American sage ceremony, as well as Buddhist, Islamic, Jewish and Christian prayers in five languages.

About 250 community members came to pay their respects, including Naha Armady of East Hollywood, who told LAist the experience was moving and emotional, especially after losing a family member and a pet earlier this year.

“It felt like it was totally meant to be for me to be able to come and hold space for these souls,” Armady said. “It's just an opportunity to have time and space and kind of honor the dead, and also maybe get a little bit of closure.”

Members of the community, along with county officials and faith leaders, placed white roses and bouquets of flowers they brought from home on the communal grave. One man sprinkled a few drops of whiskey over the petals from a black coffee cup.

Paying respects

Officials say the ceremony is designed to make sure every person in L.A. County, regardless of their means, is remembered with respect, dignity and compassion.

Justin Szlasa, a commissioner for the regional Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, told LAist the ceremony is an opportunity to honor fellow Angelenos who may have been overlooked or lonely in life.

“These are people who are not connected to the community in a way that I wish they would be,” Szlasa said. “And I think it's really wrapped up in the work that we do related to trying to solve the homelessness problem here in Los Angeles.”

A video of this year’s Ceremony of the Unclaimed Dead is available here.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass has asked the City Council to increase the Los Angeles Police Department’s budget by $4.4 million to hire 410 more officers before July.

In a letter to council members yesterday, Bass wrote that the city needs to have enough officers to keep Angelenos safe in coming years, including during major events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games.

LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell made a similar argument at a Budget and Finance Commission meeting Tuesday, where he said that despite the city’s budget problems, he worries about whether L.A. will be prepared for the Olympics in 2028 under currently approved staffing.

Several City Council members have already been pushing back against the proposal, arguing that the budget for those positions was negotiated and signed by Bass in June.

“The council and the mayor signed a budget that included 240 new hires,” Councilmember Katy Yaroslavsky said at the Budget and Finance Commission meeting on Tuesday. “The department chose to hire that full 240 in the first six months of this year.”

“Our job is to keep the city safe. We also have a responsibility to keep it solvent,” Yaroslavsky told LAist in an emailed statement. “I want to grow the police department, but I have yet to see a proposal that identifies an ongoing funding source to pay for more officers.”

LAPD hiring goals twice as high as current budget

Mayor Bass initially proposed a budget back in April recommending funding to support 480 new LAPD officers.

The final budget was a compromise reached by the City Council that approved hiring 240 new recruits in the midst of a budget crisis and attempts to reduce layoffs across the city. According to a press release on June 7, the day after she signed the final budget, Bass announced a plan to find additional funding within 90 days to bring the total LAPD hires to 480.

The funding never materialized and no additional positions have yet been approved.

LAPD has already hit its hiring cap of 240 new officers, according to a letter from the city personnel department.

The city’s most recent financial status report filed on Dec. 5 by City Administrative Officer Matt Szabo says if LAPD continues hiring at its current pace, the department would add 410 new sworn officers and exceed the plan previously budgeted.

The report shows that costs of the additional 410 officers would be expected to exceed $4.4 million through June, then about $23.7 million in the next fiscal year.

Chief McDonnell spoke to council members at the Budget and Finance Committee about the pace of hiring, and said that the department did what it was “told to do.”

“Our understanding was . . . that we would be able to hire an additional 240 if we hired 240 in the first six months,” McDonnell said, “we did that.”

The department cannot continue hiring without the additional positions requested by Bass.

Show me the money

At Tuesday’s Budget and Finance meeting, Councilmember Tim McOsker asked Szabo whether any funds had ever been identified to fill those positions.

“There has not been a formal report issued to this body identifying funds for additional hiring above what is in the budget,” Szabo replied.

“Is there any proposal — any sort of competent, grown up, adult proposal — for how we pay for this?” McOsker, who also chairs the Personnel and Hiring Committee, asked in a follow up question to Szabo.

“Not that I'm aware of,” Szabo replied. He said his office would be happy to identify reductions to fund additional hiring, but had not been instructed to do so.

That means the proposed hires would need to come from the city’s reserve funds, which Szabo’s office cautioned against.

“The impact of this overspending in 2025-26 and 2026-27 cannot be overlooked,” his office’s financial status report states, “as it represents a departure from the approved plan with likely repercussions to the City’s Reserve Fund.”

The reserve fund currently sits at 5.06 percent of the total general fund budget, according to the report, but overspending — primarily driven by LAPD and liability payments — could bring the reserve fund below emergency levels of 5 percent.

“We should never, as a practice, assume the use of the reserve fund for hiring police officers,” Szabo told the Budget and Finance Committee. “The reserve fund is there for unexpected circumstances.”

In an emailed statement provided to LAist, McOsker said he agrees with the mayor that public safety is the highest priority.

“I agreed with the Mayor six months ago when she originally proposed this saying she would work with Council Leadership to find the money to fund more officers.” McOsker said, “But six months later, this remains a proposal with no funding identification.”

Bass told Larry Mantle on AirTalk that the city is looking at “every account possible” to find money for more officers, and that not approving more hiring will also have a financial cost.

“ Either we hire new officers or we continue to spend millions and millions of dollars in overtime,” she said.

LA Mayor Karen Bass calls for allocating more money to police department hiring

Hermon just got its first sit-down restaurant.

If you've never heard of the Northeast Los Angeles neighborhood tucked between Highland Park and El Sereno, you're not alone. Unless you live there or regularly navigate the Arroyo Seco, Hermon tends to fly under the radar.

While its hip neighbors have seen wave after wave of restaurant openings, this 3,500-resident community has remained untouched. Until now.

Opened Dec. 3, Hermon's sits on the main stretch of Monterey Road, the latest venture from Last Word Hospitality — the restaurant group behind Found Oyster, Barra Santos, Queen's Raw Bar & Grill and Rasarumah. Founded in 2014 by Holly Fox and Adam Weisblatt, the group partners with chefs and hospitality professionals, helping them become restaurant owners.

The neighborhood of Hermon was founded in 1903 by a Free Methodist Church group and named after the biblical Mount Hermon. Annexed into Los Angeles in 1912, Hermon has grown quietly as a primarily residential area. But it remains one of Northeast LA's last underserved neighborhoods, with limited amenities and stores. Anyone interested in dining out was restricted to takeout spots at the Fresco Community Market shopping center.

From banquet hall to bar seats

The 89-seat restaurant occupies a former banquet hall that belonged to the Free Methodist Church, with Art Deco bones in a decidedly Craftsman neighborhood. The all-booth dining room features a U-shaped bar, handmade California tilework, hickory floors and vintage artwork spanning centuries.

Fox spent five years pursuing the building, drawn to its corner location and architectural details. The landlord initially resisted, citing risk, but came around after detailed presentations and tours of Barra Santos and Queen's. The next stop was the Hermon Neighborhood Council. Fox's team pitched in the space itself, emphasizing architectural restoration. The clincher? The name.

""The first thing she said to me was, 'The smartest thing you've done is name it Hermon,'"" Fox recalled of the council president's reaction. ""'You saw a community and you said, ""Let's build a reflection of who they are.""'""

Community goal

Gentrification concerns — common at Last Word's other openings — never surfaced. Instead, Fox said the community seemed eager to be recognized.

Nicole Mihalka, president of the Hermon Neighborhood Council, said the name itself was significant for the small community.

""Not a lot of people know what Hermon is, but now if there's this great restaurant that's a destination with Hermon in the name, they're going to have to find out,"" she said.

The opening fulfills a long-standing community goal. In 2018, when the Hermon Neighborhood Council asked residents what they wanted to see more of in the neighborhood, the answer was clear: walkable retail and amenities, including restaurants and cafes.

The story illustrates Last Word Hospitality's intentional approach to developing ""in-between"" neighborhoods rather than adding to already-saturated dining corridors.

Opening with a happy hour was non-negotiable for Fox — a signal from day one that Hermon's is built for locals. Running daily until 6 p.m., there are $10 martinis and food specials priced between $6-8 that include garlic bread, marinated olives and loaded potato fritters. Fox said happy hour sales already match the next two hours combined, proving the pricing strategy is working for neighborhood regulars.

The menu

Chef/partner DK Kolender, whose résumé includes Tartine and Dudley's Market, leads the kitchen with a New American bar and grill menu, offering polished crowd-pleasers with an edge.

Kolender is most excited about the two-sheet lasagna vongole ($36) — clams, cream, guanciale, parmesan and breadcrumbs layered between fresh pasta made daily. The dish evolved from a clam toast he made at Dudley's Market, after weeks of developing a verde lasagna that never quite landed.

A closer look at the Ode to Chez burger — char, melt and a little sauce drip for good measure.

The Ode to Chez cheeseburger ($24) — originally created for a Malibu project lost in the Palisades fires — features soubise fondue studded with green peppercorns, bordelaise onions, Dijon and a sesame milk bun developed with Kolender's former team at Tartine. Skip the $6 fries and opt instead for the loaded potato fritters ($16), topped with cream cheese, bacon and parmesan. It's the kind of indulgence that doesn't leave you weighed down.

Since the opening, Kolender says the response has been overwhelming.

""We've had people who live down the street here two, three times already,"" he said. ""We know them by name.""

For Fox, it's unprecedented.

""I have never opened a restaurant with this much support,"" she said. ""It's an unbelievable feeling.""",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a985428/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+211/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F62%2F70%2F200f8adf42fc8d604813885642ee%2Fgettyimages-484894624.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 00:57:24.749973

Greater transparency in how potential impacts are managed as Western Australia progresses its renewable energy transition

Draft Code open for public comment until 10 April 2026

The Cook Government has today released the draft Renewable Energy Planning Code and supporting Guidelines for public comment.

It marks a significant milestone in shaping how the next generation of renewable energy development will be assessed in Western Australia, as the government works towards becoming a renewable energy powerhouse.

The draft Code establishes a clear, consistent and transparent planning framework for wind farm proposals and is structured to allow for future expansion to other forms of renewable energy infrastructure, such as solar farms and battery energy storage systems.

It delivers greater transparency and consistency in how potential impacts, such as noise and visual amenity, are assessed and managed. The draft Code also provides clarity in development application requirements and standards, giving industry confidence to invest and ensuring communities understand how proposals will be evaluated.

Once finalised, the Code can be incorporated into local planning schemes, providing a consistent set of standards and requirements for assessing renewable energy proposals across the State.

To complement the Code, the State Government is also progressing targeted regulatory reforms to reinforce its intent and strengthen planning controls for renewable energy projects, including requiring development approval for new noise-sensitive developments near wind farms and a mandatory streamlined approval pathway for projects over $20 million.

Together with the recently released draft Guideline on Community Benefits for Renewable Energy Projects, the proposed changes provide a comprehensive and contemporary approach to planning for renewable energy development in Western Australia.

Public consultation on the draft Code and Guidelines will run until 10 April 2026. Submissions can be made online or by mail. For more information, visit Have your say, WA!.

Comments attributed to Planning and Lands Minister John Carey:

""The release of the draft Renewable Energy Planning Code and supporting Guidelines for public comment is a significant step in ensuring Western Australia has a clear and consistent policy framework that supports investment in renewable energy projects that will be critical to our future economy.

""The draft Code provides a transparent and contemporary planning framework that gives certainty to industry, while ensuring communities have clarity about how potential impacts will be assessed and managed.

""A strong and streamlined approvals pathway is essential to giving proponents confidence to progress major clean energy projects that support jobs and drive regional development.

""I encourage Western Australians to review the draft Code and Guidelines and share their feedback during the consultation period.""

Gas is being positioned as the workhorse that follows a first wave of renewables and storage at new data center sites.","NextEra Energy is betting that a new model for serving massive hyperscale data centers will shape the next decade of U.S. power generation development, where these large customers will “bring your own generation,” finance the assets and hire an experienced builder to deliver the megawatts.

“The market is heading towards bring your own generation,” said John Ketchum, president, CEO and chairman of NextEra Energy, during the company’s recent analyst and investor day. “At the end of the day, someone must pay for new power plants, relying exclusively on recontracting or using existing or new utility power plants could be faced with affordability concerns. We’re already seeing this across the country.”

That affordability pressure, combined with accelerating load growth, is pushing large customers toward a model where they pay for new generation directly while utilities and developers focus on siting, permitting, construction and operations.

NextEra is positioning itself as that developer, and gas-fired power is a key part of the strategy.

BYOG in practice: Duane Arnold and beyond

Ketchum pointed to the restart of Iowa’s Duane Arnold facility as a proof point for the bring your own generation trend.

NextEra has taken full ownership of the approximately 601-megawatt (MW) plant and expects it back online by early-2029, pending regulatory approvals. The project is designed as both a dedicated supply resource for a large data center customer and a cornerstone for a broader regional “data center hub” concept that layers in additional generation over time.

“Google is paying for the [Duane Arold] plant, so Iowa customers do not have to,” said Ketchum.

Similar patterns are emerging in North Dakota and the Gulf Coast, where NextEra is advancing BYOG style projects aligned with new gas generation and carbon management.

In North Dakota, the company is working with Basin Electric Cooperative on a proposed 1.5-gigawatt (GW) combined cycle plant that would anchor a hub for future renewables, storage and additional gas capacity. In another project, NextEra is partnering with ExxonMobil to test hyperscaler demand for gas-fired generation paired with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). The companies control a 1.2 GW site with access to high-voltage transmission and plan to jointly market it to data center customers.

“These initial hubs are primed to grow significantly as we continue building to meet demand,” said Brian Bolster, president and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources.

Data center hubs and a gas heavy pipeline

To support large load customers, NextEra is formalizing its “data center hub” model: multi-gigawatt complexes where different forms of generation can be added over time.

“It is exactly what it sounds like,” Ketchum said. “It is a power generation complex that we can scale over time, leveraging all forms of energy.”

NextEra has set a goal of placing in service 15 GW of new generation for data center hubs by 2035, with an upside case of 30 GW if current demand trends hold. The company says it has already identified 20 potential hubs and is working to double that list to 40 by the end of 2026.

Gas-fired generation is expected to carry much of that build. Ketchum said the company’s gas generation development pipeline has “now eclipsed 20 gigawatts” across 11 states. NextEra has already secured 4 GW of GE Vernova gas turbine slots to support that buildout and is targeting 4 to 8 GW of new gas generation through 2032, with more beyond that as data center hubs scale.

Gas is being positioned as the workhorse that follows a first wave of renewables and storage at new data center sites.

“Our renewables and storage portfolio provides us with a speed to market solution to get the initial phase of a data center off the ground and built,” Ketchum said. “We can then follow that up with new gas fired generation.”

That “bridge power” concept is central to how NextEra says these projects come together. In many cases, initial load is served by solar and battery storage, or by repowering and expanding existing sites that already have interconnection rights and substation infrastructure. Those assets can be in place faster than new gas pipelines and large combined cycle units, giving hyperscalers a way to start building campuses while longer lead time projects advance.

Ketchum noted that bridge power “might be renewables. It might be storage, it might be aeroderivatives.”

Behind-the-meter configurations with “front-of-the-meter optionality” to serve the broader grid are also on the table. Ketchum said NextEra is “working on behind-the-meter solutions that come with front-of-the-meter optionality over time.”

Over the life of a hub, NextEra expects the generation mix to evolve. Early phases may be dominated by renewables and storage. Later phases could add combined cycle gas, nuclear restarts, and eventually small modular reactors at or near existing nuclear sites.

NextEra is also marketing surplus nuclear capacity at its Point Beach and Seabrook facilities to large customers and sees those sites as candidates for future small modular reactor (SMR) co-location.

A builder’s market

Ketchum framed the opportunity in simple terms for developers, plant operators and suppliers.

“We are in a golden age of power demand,” he said. “America needs all forms of energy from renewables and storage to gas and advanced nuclear.”

In this environment, he argued, the advantage will lie with companies that can secure land, interconnection, equipment and capital at scale, then build out multi-gigawatt hubs around the needs of large customers.

“We believe that competing for new data centers is all about building new electrons, not trading around existing assets,” Ketchum said. “We believe this is the future of our business, and we’re the only company that could do this on a national scale right now.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 20:59:59.510249

Aidala,,,,,https://www.lawbc.com/shutdown-redux/,"It appears increasingly likely that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies will face yet another shutdown at the end of January 2026.
November 12, 2025’s, Hail Mary Senate agreement funds the government at existing spending levels — but only until January 30, 2026.

The budgets for EPA and other federal agencies are likely to remain flat, stagnant — with the same FY 2026 appropriation as that of FY 2025.
Even with the prospect of increased funding from fees in both programs, stagnation or cuts in appropriations have an adverse impact on program performance.","It appears increasingly likely that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies will face yet another shutdown at the end of January 2026. When Congress failed to pass appropriations legislation for the 2026 fiscal year (FY) by September 30, 2025, what ensued was a record-setting 43-day closure of the U.S. government. November 12, 2025’s, Hail Mary Senate agreement funds the government at existing spending levels — but only until January 30, 2026. The bill that ended the shutdown contains a few appropriations to fund certain important functions beyond the January 30 deadline, SNAP programs and military payroll among them, but a renewed threat looms over a vast stretch of government activity if further progress is not made before the end of January.

Early reporting suggested that attempts are being made to move appropriations between agencies, but that positive momentum seems increasingly stalled as time marches on. Rumors point to a potential FY 2026 “minibus” bill — a partial “omnibus” appropriations bill — that might separately fund agencies like EPA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but each effort appears to invite opposition by House or Senate members sufficiently powerful enough to once more pump the breaks. In addition to the rehashing of impacts seen during the 43-day shutdown — shuttered National Parks, lengthy airport delays, and fears of whether government payments will be made on time — there are two less obvious ramifications for the federal workforce and its ability to perform as expected.

For EPA and the pesticide and chemical industry focused on the operational integrity at the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP), the impacts of the last shutdown seem limited, as OCSPP programs were funded to-date and mostly operational thanks to leftover funds from prior appropriations, fees considered “not subject to annual appropriations,” and Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) fees authorized by the statutes. Given the availability of funds used to support program work during the most recent shutdown, it is not clear how much funding from these sources might be left to support another shutdown of any length. If limited funds lead to limited program operations, submitters and other stakeholders may be affected by halts to programs to approve new products or complete review work, two key functions of OCSPP staff.

A subtler but even more harrowing consequence will be seen etched on the face of every EPA and government employee facing yet another shutdown. Two back-to-back work interruptions within six months, coming on the heels of threats of mass dismissal for some employees — threats designed to damage morale and encourage early retirements and buy-outs going hand-in-hand with plans to impose further reductions-in-force (RIF) — does not a happy holidays make, regardless of what eventual appropriations may be coming down the pipeline. This is the human consequence. When you factor in a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) that will not be able to compete against the rising tide of inflation and the expected significant increase in the employee share of health insurance coverage, a particularly bleak picture begins to emerge. The future prospects of any federal agencies hoping for robust recruitment numbers is grim, at best, as noted in our March 4, 2025, blog item — and that was written before the government shutdown.

It will be important to keep an eye on not just whether another shutdown happens but also on its eventual resolution, whenever and whatever that may be. The budgets for EPA and other federal agencies are likely to remain flat, stagnant — with the same FY 2026 appropriation as that of FY 2025. This would not be the first time that new appropriations include no increase in program funding. But program costs, suffering from the same inflation we all do, continue to rise. Programs must “eat” the COLA — however large or small — and that hurt can get passed along. Contractors and other suppliers will likely find a need to increase the bill for their products and services. Even a small COLA shortfall — one to two percent — can over time have an outsized impact. If the overall budget does not increase, but COLA and inflation go up, government agencies are being forced to do more with less and less each year. Congress has held budgets at or below COLA increases for much of recent history, with cuts being made to other areas of the budget to make up for COLA increases. OCSPP continues to stare down the expanded duties that came with the 2016 TSCA Amendments but with no increased funding in sight. Program officials note that staff available to complete FIFRA work has declined, even with a robust Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2022 (PRIA 5) fee program. Even with the prospect of increased funding from fees in both programs, stagnation or cuts in appropriations have an adverse impact on program performance.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-869295582.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 20:59:45.115555

The critical state protections that Donald Trump wants to prosecute—including guardrails like large load tariffs—are in place to ensure everyday Americans are not held liable for data centers’ massive power and infrastructure needs. Sierra Club has helped utilities, regulators, and consumer advocates implement commonsense safeguards like long-term contracts, credit guarantees, and minimum bills that protect affordability for residential customers.

The executive order also seeks to get rid of state standards that protect Americans from toxic fossil fuel pollution at data centers. If these protections get rolled back—which Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency is already trying to do—Americans will be exposed to far more pollutants in their air and water.

In response, Sierra Club Principal Advisor Jeremy Fisher issued the following statement:

“This executive order is nothing more than federal overreach that will further increase costs and remove protections for the American people. These state protections are in place because Americans have a right to privacy and transparency, and must not be held responsible for the massive costs of data centers operated by some of the richest companies in the world. Utility bills have already been skyrocketing due to growing energy demand from data centers and utilities’ reliance on expensive fossil fuels, and we must be doing everything we can to lower these costs and prioritize affordability.

“If Donald Trump cares at all about lowering costs for Americans, he should work on setting up more safeguards for customers, rather than bulldozing the progress states have made thus far.

It was one of the final obstacles the controversial Diablo Canyon Power Plant had to clear to continue operating amid renewed opposition. The decision was conditioned on a plan that would require Pacific Gas & Electric, which owns the plant, to conserve about 4,000 acres of land on its property. That would prevent it from ever being developed for commercial or residential use.

The plant, located along the San Luis Obispo shoreline, now awaits federal approval for a 20-year relicensing permit.

“I don’t think, unfortunately, that anything will be happening to Diablo Canyon soon,” due to the growing energy demands of artificial intelligence, Commissioner Jaime Lee said before voting to approve the permit. Nine of the 12 voting members approved the plan.

The deliberations reignited decades-old concerns about the dangers of nuclear power and its place in the state’s portfolio of renewable energy sources. Diablo Canyon is the state’s single-largest energy source, providing nearly 10% of all California electricity.

Defeated in their earlier attempts to shut the plant, critics of Diablo Canyon used months of Coastal Commission hearings as one of their last opportunities to vocalize their disdain for the facility. Some Democratic lawmakers supported the plant but pushed for PG&E to find more ways to protect the environment.

Sen. John Laird, Democrat of San Luis Obispo County and former secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, said on Thursday he approved of the new plan but pushed the commission to require the utility to conserve even more of its total 12,000 surrounding acres.

“If what comes out of this is the path for preservation for 8,000 acres of land, that is a remarkable victory,” Laird said.

Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis, whose district encompasses the plant, had also urged the commission in a letter to approve a permit “once it contains strong mitigation measures that reflect the values and needs of the surrounding tribal and local communities who depend on our coastal regions for environmental health, biodiversity and economic vitality.”

A long history of controversy

Founded in 1985, the plant’s striking concrete domes sit along the Pacific coast 200 miles north of Los Angeles. The facility draws in 2 million gallons of water from the ocean every day to cool its systems

And it has remained shrouded in controversy since its construction 40 years ago. Environmentalists point to the damage it causes to marine life, killing what the Coastal Commission estimates are 2 billion larval fish a year.

The commissioners on Thursday were not deciding whether to allow the plant to stay open but were weighing how best to lessen the environmental impacts of its operation. A 2022 state law forced the plant to stay open for five more years past its planned 2025 closure date, which could have led to significant political blowback against the Coastal Commission if it had rejected the permit.

Gov. Gavin Newsom reversed a 2016 agreement made between environmental groups and worker unions to close the plant after the state faced a series of climate disasters that spurred energy blackouts. Popular sentiment toward nuclear energy has also continued to grow more supportive as states across the country consider revitalizing dormant and aging nuclear plants to fulfill ever-increasing energy demand needs.

The 2022 law authorized a $1.4 billion loan to be paid back with federal loans or profits.

Groups such as the Environmental Defense Center and Mothers for Peace opposed the permit outright, citing concerns about radioactive waste, which can persist for centuries, and its cost to taxpayers.

“We maintain that any extension of Diablo is unnecessary,” and that its continued operations could slow the development of solar and wind energy, Jeremy Frankel, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Center told the commission Thursday.

The California Public Utilities Commission last year approved $723 million in ratepayer funds toward Diablo Canyon’s operating costs this year. It was the first time rate hikes were spread to ratepayers of other utilities such as Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric and was authorized by lawmakers because the plant provides energy to the entire state.

How the plant will be funded has also garnered scrutiny in the years since Newsom worked to keep it open. Last year, the Legislature nearly canceled a $400 million loan to help finance it.

As much as $588 million is unlikely to come back due to insufficient federal funding and projected profits, CalMatters has reported.

Proponents of the plant pointed to its reliability, carbon-free pollution and the thousands of jobs it has created.

Business advocacy groups emphasized their support for the plant as boosting the economy.

“It is an economic lifeline that helps keep our communities strong and competitive,” Dora Westerlund, president of the Fresno Area Hispanic Foundation, said at a November meeting.",https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/110308-Diablo-Canyon-AP-CM-01.jpeg,N,,2025-12-11 21:58:47.911769

The Q3 Plugged-In: EV Collision Insights report also reveals:

Claims Severity: Average severity for repairable BEVs dropped to $6,185 in the U.S. and $6,954 (CAD) in Canada, a decrease of 2.4% and 1.5% respectively from Q2. In both countries, automobiles with an internal combustion engine (ICE) had the lowest average severity followed by mild hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).

Claims Frequency by Region: Regions with the most BEVs per capita also continue to have the highest number of BEV collision claims. Last quarter, 8.74% of all repairable vehicle claims in British Columbia were for BEVs. Quebec came in a close second at 8.37% and California was third at 6.50%.

Total Loss Market Values: Total loss market values averaged $29,827 for BEVs, a decrease of approximately 1% from Q2, compared with $13,979 for ICE automobiles.

Parts Utilization: Without a robust alternate parts industry for BEVs, OEM parts are most frequently used in BEV collision repairs. On estimates, 85% of the parts dollars for repairable vehicles in Q3 were designated for OEM parts—a slight increase over the previous quarter—versus 62% for ICE alternatives.

Dec 12 (Reuters) - Global EV sales grew in November at the slowest rate since February 2024 as China plateaued, while the end of an EV tax credit scheme in the United States set North America on track for its first year of decline since 2019, data showed.

In Europe, registrations of electric vehicles, including battery-electric and plug-in hybrids, maintained strong growth thanks to national incentive programs and are up by a third so far this year compared with the same period of 2024, consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI) said on Friday.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

Electric transport groups say a swift EV transition is necessary to curb planet-warming CO2 emissions, but carmakers and governments have backtracked on some green commitments due to slower-than-anticipated EV adoption, which auto lobby groups say threatens jobs and profit margins.

BY THE NUMBERS

Global EV registrations, a proxy for sales, rose by 6% to just under 2 million units in November, the data showed.

They were up by 3% in China to more than 1.3 million, the lowest year-on-year increase since February 2024.

North American registrations fell by 42% to just over 100,000 cars sold, following a similar drop in October at the end of U.S. tax credits, and are down 1% so far this year.

Europe and the rest of the world were up respectively by 36% and 35% to more than 400,000 and almost 160,000 registrations.

Tonya Jameson, director of Civic Advancement for Leading on Opportunity, a nonprofit created to foster mobility, said the federal cuts don’t help.","When scores of masked federal agents swarmed into Charlotte last month, veteran journalist Rafael Prieto was shocked by what he saw.

Armed men snatched immigrants from front yards, parking lots and work sites, pulled them from cars and threw some to the ground. Anxiety spiked for many of Mecklenburg County’s 175,000 Hispanic residents. Businesses closed. Students stayed home. People who needed medical help were afraid to get it.

Prieto, 71, a naturalized citizen from Colombia, did something he’d never done. “I carried my passport in my pocket for the first time ever,” he said. “These (agents) didn’t respect anyone or anything.”

“Operation Charlotte’s Web” disrupted lives and families and raised concerns throughout the community. It made national headlines. It’s just one of many Trump administration policies that have impacted people here.

Roughly a year into the second Trump administration, changes have frayed federal safety nets and upended practices once taken for granted. They’ve affected housing, health care, food security and education. New policies have impacted how people live and, in at least one case, where they live.

“We need to acknowledge the attack that we’re under and do what we can to support our nonprofit service providers, who are meeting increased need with fewer resources,” said Kathryn Firmin-Sellers, president and CEO of United Way of Greater Charlotte.

The effects aren’t hard to find. Mecklenburg County health officials had to lay off people working to slow the spread of HIV. Housing advocates are scrambling to ensure that people who get federal housing aid don’t lose it. Food banks are coping with the loss of one federal assistance program and cuts to another.

“Ultimately our super-hero cape is not big enough to shoulder the crisis that the federal government has created,” said Tina Postel, CEO of Nourish Up, a local food pantry.

Border Patrol officials said they went after “the worst of the worst,” though offered no proof for most of the more than 400 people detained in Mecklenburg. But the arrest last week by police of an undocumented immigrant for allegedly stabbing a light rail passenger reignited concerns among some – including President Donald Trump.

Some say the federal budget cuts reflect spending constraints as well as philosophical differences in the role of the federal government.

“It may just be a differing view of what the federal government should do going forward,” said Republican Tariq Bokhari, a former Charlotte City Council member who briefly served as deputy administrator of the Federal Transit Administration.

The cuts in federal spending have come at a time when some nonprofits have seen private philanthropic and charitable gifts decline. Tracy Russ, a senior vice president of the Foundation for the Carolinas, calls it a kind of “double whammy” that he expects to get worse.

“What I’m most fearful of is what these impacts look like a year or two from now,” he said.

For many service providers, the “double whammy” comes at a fraught time. With inflation up 25% since 2020, more families are squeezed.

“The need has never been greater in the 50-year history of Crisis Assistance Ministry,” said Carol Hardison, its longtime CEO.

New Rules Could Displace Hundreds in Mecklenburg County

Karen Pelletier, director of the county’s Housing Innovation & Stabilization Services, remembers how she felt when she saw November’s email from federal housing officials.

“Helpless and concerned,” she recalls.

The email confirmed that the federal government was making a major change in housing policy by essentially ending Housing First. That program is based on the notion that housing should be a prerequisite for people dealing with addictions or mental illness, not a reward for overcoming them. Advocates say it’s got a track record of success in getting people off the streets and under roofs.

“All the research will tell you that Housing First is the appropriate course of action,” said Firmin-Sellers. “The model is that you get people into Housing First and then you provide the wraparound supports to help them stay there.”

The new policy would enact work requirements and require – not just encourage – addiction or mental health treatment. Federal aid would be temporary and designed to help people transition to private housing. The New York Times called the policy shift “the most consequential in a generation.”

“That completely erases the 10 years of success that we’ve had in Housing First,” Pelletier said.

Devon Kurtz of the conservative Cicero Institute told the New York Times that, “Housing First simultaneously expected too much of people, by assuming everyone was ready for housing, and too little, in terms of the lack of expectations for sobriety and work.”

But nationwide, experts say the new approach could cost 170,000 people their homes, including many who are elderly or disabled. In Mecklenburg, Pelletier said 513 people currently live in so-called “permanent supportive housing.” She said the change could displace hundreds who’ve been stably housed for years.

“Without this assistance, many of them are going to end up back in our homeless system,” Pelletier said. In a community that already has more than 2,300 homeless people, what that means is unclear.

“We don’t have capacity in our shelter system,” Pelletier said.

A Fraying Public Health Safety Net

Federal budget cuts. Vaccine skeptics. Looming Medicaid cuts. Rising health insurance costs. No single threat keeps Dr. Raynard Washington awake at night.

“They all keep you up,” said Washington, the county’s public health director.

He lost more than a dozen employees to budget cuts or program changes. That includes disease investigation specialists specializing in HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. Though some jobs were restored, the interruption led to delays.

“The consequence of that is somebody else gets exposed to a disease,” Washington said.

Chelsea Gulden, executive director of RAIN, a nonprofit focused on HIV, told Qnotes that because of federal budget cuts, “we are poised to see numbers of HIV increase in a way we have not seen in years.”

Washington has seen evidence that more people appear to share Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s skepticism of vaccines. That includes public doubts about an early childhood vaccine that can prevent pertussis, or whooping cough. Washington said the number of pertussis cases, normally around two, jumped to 70 in the past year with outbreaks often concentrated.

Washington said there’s been a rise in the number of families seeking religious exemptions to school vaccine requirements. They “simply don’t know who to trust,” he said.

One out of three Mecklenburg residents – 416,000 – receive benefits from Medicaid, the health care program for the poor. County officials say as many as 31,000 could lose them under new federal work requirements. They say that could grow to more than 80,000 if North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion program ends.

The N.C. General Assembly has yet to act on that program, which serves more than 687,000 North Carolinians.

Then there’s the pending expiration of extended subsidies for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. In Mecklenburg, that’s more than 135,000 people, according to Nicholas Riggs, director of the NC Navigator Consortium. He said premiums could soar.

Carolyn Willey of Indian Trail said her family of three has been paying around $400 a month under the ACA. Because her husband’s income as a general contractor rose to where they would lose their federal subsidy, they would now have to pay $1,200 a month for basic coverage.

“We were shocked to see it was going up that much,” Willey said.

Food Assistance Shrinks as Need Surges

On a sunny fall morning, Brittany Mays waited in her car outside an east Charlotte church that doubled as a mobile distribution site for Nourish Up. She’s a mother of four whose husband was laid off from a car dealership. They relied on SNAP – the federal emergency food program – until it was suspended during the 42-day government shutdown.

“With the change in income and not being able to afford the high price of groceries… it means a lot,” she said of the food donation.

The shutdown only exacerbated the challenge for Mecklenburg’s 137,000 SNAP recipients. Federal help has fallen sharply. Nourish Up, for example, has seen a 50% drop in help from the Emergency Food Assistance Program. Another program, which would have provided $11 million to food banks around the state, has ended.

This year, Congress added work requirements to the SNAP program and shifted some costs to states and counties. Officials say the work requirements alone could result in 17,000 county residents losing benefits.

“What just baffles me beyond comprehension is the lack of compassion in all these policies for lower- and middle-income people,” said Tina Postel, Nourish Up’s CEO. “How much more cruel can you be to keep food off the plates of children and seniors on fixed income and hard-working individuals who just aren’t making a livable wage?”

Policy Shifts Deepen Fears in LGBTQ+ Community

Annelise Mennicke has received a lot of research grants in her career, including from the National Institutes of Health. But she never lost one until this year.

Mennicke, who teaches in UNC Charlotte’s School of Social Work, had received a $450,000 grant from the NIH to help members of the LGBTQ+ community who became victims of sexual assault. Mennicke is research director for the university’s Violence Prevention Center.

In March, she got a letter from the NIH. “This award no longer effectuates agency priorities,” it read. “Research programs based on gender identity … do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.” Such studies, it added, ignore “biological realities.”

One of Trump’s first executive orders said, “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.”

Mennicke’s was one of 19 federally funded grants terminated at UNC Charlotte, according to school officials. Her grant was restored this summer when the U.S. Supreme Court issued a mixed ruling in a case brought by the American Public Health Association.

But for Mennicke, “‘emotional roller coaster’ doesn’t begin to describe this experience.”

“I’ve been having panic attacks,” she said. “I’ve had trouble being present with my family. I’ve spiraled into existential crises around whether I can stay in academia, in North Carolina, or even in the United States. My grandmother fled Germany in 1939 to flee the Nazis … How did she know it was time to flee? How will I know?”

Amanda Dumas knew.

She was a Huntersville town commissioner until this fall when she and her 14-year-old transgender son moved to Canada. Like many members of the LGBTQ+ community and their families, she saw an increasingly threatening political environment. Then, she said, Atrium Health stopped offering gender affirming care this summer.

“That was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Dumas, who has dual citizenship. “There’s no reason for us to stay if we can no longer even access health care.”

DEI Rollbacks Reverberate Through Local Institutions

On the day he took office, Trump signed an executive order calling Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs “illegal and immoral.”

“That ends today,” it said.

Ra’Shawn Flournoy, executive director of a health care center that caters to Black members of the LGBTQ+ community, has said DEI caused the center to lose a grant dealing with prevention of sexually transmitted infections.

“Our STI grant was cut,” he told Qnotes, “and because of the DEI mandate … the administration had actually even called us and said because we had language that had DEI in it, we had 48 hours to change it before we lost all of our funding.”

UNC Charlotte had already closed three DEI-related offices in 2024 to comply with system-wide UNC policies. Money and staff were reassigned to other programs.

This year, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools lost about $6.8 million in grants to support teacher development and recruitment because they were perceived to foster DEI. Board Chair Stephanie Sneed said CMS still has to deal with the diversity of a district where 146 languages are spoken.

“Our district is majority-minority, and that demands that we lead with intentionality,” she said. “Programs that support multilingual learners, cultural diversity, and student-specific needs are not optional – they are essential to ensuring every child has access to rigorous instruction and real opportunity.”

Sneed said her more immediate concern is the well-being of the system’s 44,000 Hispanic students. With federal agents in town, some kids went to school with handwritten notes attached to their book bags saying, “I am a citizen.”

“It is the emotional impact that this has had on our families, which affects the ability to learn,” Sneed said. As many as 30,000 students missed school on one day during the crackdown. Sneed worries that they might not have had the breakfast or lunch they can get at school.

“It’s a cascading impact,” she said. “It contributes to our children being successful in our school district.”

Funding Cuts Undermine Charlotte’s Mobility Gains

Opportunity – or the lack of it – was the theme of a 2014 study by Harvard researcher Raj Chetty. It ranked Charlotte and its surrounding area last among 50 U.S. cities in upward mobility. It was a wake-up call that prompted a concerted community effort to improve. The Charlotte area rose to 38th in last year’s Chetty rating.

Tonya Jameson, director of Civic Advancement for Leading on Opportunity, a nonprofit created to foster mobility, said the federal cuts don’t help.

“If a mother or father can’t feed their family, how can we expect them to be able to go to work and advance economically?” she said. “Now you’re forced to just be in survival mode.”

A survey of around 200 nonprofits by UNC Charlotte’s Urban Institute for the Foundation for the Carolinas and United Way of Greater Charlotte found that 30% reported cuts in public funding this year. Forty-seven percent reported losses from other sources.

The survey found that while most reported greater need for services and resources, 31% were serving fewer clients. “A growing barrier to community access of (nonprofit) services and resources was fear, particularly among marginalized communities,” the survey found. The full report has yet to be released.

“The threats are not just the federal budget cuts but … people aren’t giving as much generally,” said Tracy Russ of the Foundation for the Carolinas.

Ivan Canada, president and CEO of the N.C. Center for Nonprofits, said individual giving to many of the state’s 14,000 nonprofits has declined since Covid. One reason is that with higher standard tax deductions, there’s less incentive for some to give.

By some measures Americans are still generous. Giving by individuals, philanthropies and corporations rose to $592 billion in 2024, up 6.3% from the year before, according to Giving USA. But there are warning signs.

“There’s been a decline in trust in institutions in general and also with nonprofits,” said Michael Thatcher, CEO of Charity Navigator, a national ratings agency. “For the first time ever in 2024 the trust in nonprofits dropped below that of for-profit institutions. That’s new.”

It’s not just local funding cuts that affect Mecklenburg.

The end of solar tax credits could cost jobs in Mecklenburg’s clean energy industry, said Zach Amittay of E2, an advocacy group. It says the county has nearly 20,000 clean energy jobs.

And Internal Revenue Service cuts could cause delays in the free tax preparation services offered by the Davidson-based Ada Jenkins Center. Marsha Clark, director of the center’s asset building program, expects to help 3,200 clients next year.

“The bottom line is slowdowns,” she said.

Despite Challenges, Charlotte’s Resilience Endures

In late November, Manolo Betancur, whose Central Avenue bakery became an unofficial center for protests during the immigration crackdown, spoke at Myers Park Baptist Church.

“We used to feel alone,” he said. “I never thought we’d see this army of friends.”

During the crackdown people with camera phones videoed agents making arrests. Parents showed up at school parking lots to ensure students were safe. Churches and volunteers across the city collected and delivered food to families holed up at home. Students at several high schools walked out to protest the federal action.

“Allies are learning how to help their neighbors,” Stefanía Arteaga, co-founder of the Carolina Migrant Network, told the Guardian newspaper. “(W)here this administration is trying to sow division, we see an organic movement of community members trying to provide support and assistance.”

Like the volunteers, people in the business of helping others believe Charlotte is a resilient community. Nonprofits coping with reduced budgets and other challenges have been working together.

In September, representatives from groups that included many non-profits packed a room in the Government Center. They shared their challenges and talked about ways to deal with them. They know, as Firmin-Sellers said, “There is no amount of philanthropy that can fill the gap that is being created.”

“We’re a tough bunch,” Firmin-Sellers said. “And we’re an optimistic bunch (or) we wouldn’t be doing this. “And so in spite of all the challenges, I think leaders are more engaged and more determined to continue to do as much good as we can with what we’ve got.

“The nonprofit leaders in this community continue to inspire me. And they should inspire us all.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a57ca42/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6048x3175+0+387/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2f%2Fa6%2F8d356cbc4d6d8782f74860004122%2F2025121020064302258106.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 23:59:16.495352

The bills aim to expand California’s water storage capacity by providing funding and technical support to both develop and maintain water infrastructure projects.

“California needs a modern water system that can meet today’s challenges. These bills take meaningful steps to strengthen California’s water future. By improving coordination, cutting through red tape, and investing in real projects on the ground, we can use all of our water tools in our toolbox to deliver more reliable water for families, farms, and communities across our state. This is about practical solutions that will make a difference for the Valley and all of California,” said Congressman Costa.

“A reliable water supply is essential for Valley families and our economy,” said Rep. Gray. “My End California Water Crisis Package aims to strengthen and grow California’s water infrastructure so we can maintain dependable water supplies, reduce flood risks, and responsibly manage water flow to preserve our environment while unleashing agricultural production. The Valley is the nation’s leading agricultural region, and these projects will help ensure we remain competitive and resilient as we face historic drought levels.”

“Westlands Water District supports Congressman Gray’s End the California Water Crisis legislative package because it moves us toward real solutions at a pivotal time for California water,” said Allison Febbo, General Manager, Westlands Water District. “This pragmatic approach will cut through years of red tape and accelerate projects that will make a difference now. By moving urgently needed conveyance, groundwater recharge, and surface water storage projects from concept to construction, this package will help create a more reliable, modern water supply for the communities, farms, and under resourced communities across the San Joaquin Valley. Solving California’s water crisis takes all of us working together to reform a system that hasn’t worked for people, food production, or the environment for far too long.”

“This legislative package is exactly the type of pragmatic, solutions-oriented approach California needs,” said Chris White, Executive Director of the San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors Water Authority. “Streamlining federal permitting and advancing long-overdue water infrastructure projects will help us capture, store, and move water when it’s available—and improve reliability for agriculture, our local communities, and the environment. The Exchange Contractors appreciate Congressman Gray’s leadership and his commitment to cutting red tape, modernizing federal coordination, and delivering the infrastructure investments our region needs to prepare for the future.”

“The farms, communities, and ecosystems south of California’s Bay-Delta have been ground zero for the impacts of unreliable water supplies for decades,” said Federico Barajas, Executive Director of the San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Authority. “There is a clear solution – we must develop and deliver water supply projects faster and more affordably. This package of bills does just that – allocating federal funds and improving project delivery for a list of projects that will improve water supply reliability for one of the most important food producing regions in the world. We urge Congress to take swift action on these bills and applaud Congressman Gray for his leadership in tackling this issue head on.”

“As we face ongoing water challenges in California’s Central Valley, Congressman Gray’s water legislative package represents a significant opportunity to enhance interagency coordination and cut through the permitting obstacles that hinder vital water projects,” said Jason Phillips, CEO, Friant Water Authority. “By codifying the provisions of Executive Order 14181, our communities and farms can improve their access to the water resources they desperately need and along with the authorization of critical projects for improved water storage and management, the Central Valley would be poised to make meaningful progress in addressing our water needs and securing a sustainable future for our families and farms.”

If enacted, the End California Water Crisis Package would significantly improve water storage, clear the way for additional projects, and consequently encourage further economic and agricultural development across the region.

In the long term, much of the U.S. electricity infrastructure is old and needs to be replaced.","The western U.S. and Canada electricity grid is significantly underutilized in many areas, and the fastest way to bring new data centers online is to unlock capacity on the existing grid, a new Stanford University study finds.

Across the United States, an aging grid in some places is struggling to keep up with greater electricity demand, and more soon will, due to new data centers and ongoing electrification of industry, buildings, and transportation. In addition, huge amounts of new generation are kept from connecting to the grid due to transmission limitations and a slow-moving approval process in many parts of the country. New, high-voltage transmission lines typically take eight to 12 years to build, primarily due to painful permitting procedures. Large power transformers and substation equipment are in critically short supply, with lead times now stretching to several years. This bottleneck threatens to slow the clean energy transition and undermine U.S. economic growth.

However, analysis of the western grid may point to some near-term solutions. With transmission lines throughout the West operating well below capacity, the region’s grid has substantial room to serve new load and integrate new generation more quickly and affordably, the study’s researchers say. In highly stressed corridors, the priority investments should be in large transformers, which ramp up voltage for long distance transmission and downshift it for eventual use in large loads. Targeted replacement, refurbishment, and added flexibility of transformers could increase total grid utilization where it’s needed most for much less cost than building new long-distance transmission lines, the study finds.

“By better using the transmission system already in place, we can increase overall capacity to serve large loads in the near term and spread grid costs across more customers,” said Liang Min, the study’s senior author and managing director of the Bits & Watts Initiative, a grid modernization research and education program in Stanford’s Precourt Institute for Energy. The Precourt Institute is part of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability.

“This could go a long way in limiting electricity rate increases for existing customers and in keeping the grid reliable until the new transmission lines can be built,” Min added.

To be sure, new transmission lines will be badly needed soon and, in some cases, are needed now. Demands on the U.S. electricity system are forecast to triple by 2050.

The study, “U.S. Transmission System Utilization Study Phase 1: WECC,” is part of a series of flash research projects catalyzed by a meeting of electricity sector leaders on challenges to the U.S. grid in February this year at Stanford. Four other flash studies are wrapping up. Min and co-author Rajanie Prabha, a PhD candidate in civil and environmental engineering, expect a more detailed, technical study from their work to be published early in 2026 in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

Western grid

The new study examined North America’s western grid, which runs from New Mexico to Alberta, Canada and everything west of those states. By a wide margin, this is the largest of the six U.S.-Canada regional electricity grids. Within these regional grids, electric utilities transfer power among each other via transmission lines to, in theory at least, meet demand most economically for utilities in their region. Regional utilities maintain system reliability and plan for the future through regional associations, like the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.

Min analyzed utilization of WECC’s transmission network for peak demand, mostly on hot summer weekdays. They looked for stress points, bottlenecks, and underutilization during peak demand. High demand peaks cover about 90 hours a year. Given access to WECC data, they found that even with power use at its peak, utilities in the region used only 18% to 52% of the capacity of their transmission lines, with most utilities clustered around 30% of capacity.

However, now and in the medium term transformers face more stress than transmission lines do during peak demand days and normal operations, according to the study. Under peak conditions each utilities’ transformer assets operated at between 28% and 68% of total capacity with most utilities clustered around 45% of capacity.

“We’re also studying the Eastern Interconnection. Although our current results are from the Western grid, early patterns look similar, suggesting a larger opportunity to better use existing infrastructure for load growth and generation integration,” said Prabha, whose PhD advisory is associate professor Ram Rajagopal.

Policy implications

The study reveals several opportunities to guide how and where to optimize and expand U.S. electricity infrastructure to handle rapid demand growth:

Studies like this one, resulting in a “utilization map,” can help steer new data centers, industrial plants, and major generating projects toward corridors and regions with available headroom, avoiding long waits for new transmission lines and interconnection approvals.

By adding new, steady load growth in the right locations, the United States can increase use of existing grid infrastructure, spread costs among more customers, and modernize its infrastructure more affordably.

Targeted investments in transformer capacity in highly stressed corridors can unlock additional transfer capability, increase overall system utilization, and do so more cost-effectively than building new long-distance lines.

In the long term, much of the U.S. electricity infrastructure is old and needs to be replaced. This, combined with new demand, will require tremendous investments. Designing and renovating the system at an appropriate scale ahead of forecasted growth would be economically prudent, the study advises.",https://energy.stanford.edu/sites/energy/files/styles/large/public/media/image/wecc_grid_utilization_960x640_0.png?itok=sipp9sab,N,,2025-12-11 19:59:28.854720

Awareness of these effects has shifted public opinion in favour of reducing car dependence and investing in public transport, walking and cycling networks, and people-focused street design.
EVs are the most effective option for cutting road transport emissions, with rapid improvements in cost and performance driven by global battery innovation.
Develop a long-term, sustainable taxation framework to fund transport infrastructure, including freight corridors, multimodal urban transport, highways and the redesign of city streets.
Create an expert task force on EVs: Rapid EV adoption is key to sustainable road transport, requiring strong grid and charging infrastructure.","Georgia is at a pivotal point in shaping sustainable transport policy. This roadmap guides policy makers in making transport cleaner, fairer and more efficient while building on Georgia’s strengths – its location, institutions, competitive wages, low-emissions electricity and natural resources. Key opportunities include assembling and producing electric vehicles; manufacturing cells and battery components for mobility and storage; strengthening regional freight links; and developing low-emission fuels.

Road transport has become cleaner and more efficient, but progress needs to accelerate. Car ownership and freight activity have risen along with incomes, but this comes at a cost: Nearly all of Georgia’s transport fuel is imported, exposing the country to price and security risks. Air quality ranks 62nd of 134 countries, with pollution causing about 130 premature deaths per 100 000 people – almost triple the global average. Road fatalities totalled 442 in 2022, more than twice the rate in the European Union, while 230 deaths each year can be linked to road-related air pollution.

Public concern is mounting over the impact of a growing vehicle fleet. Civil society groups note that expanding roads in Tbilisi has worsened congestion and increased local air pollution. Awareness of these effects has shifted public opinion in favour of reducing car dependence and investing in public transport, walking and cycling networks, and people-focused street design.

Policy makers must act at the national and local levels, prioritising efficiency, electrification of road vehicles and greater use of alternative modes. Recommendations to cut emissions, boost efficiency and improve access to other transport options are grouped into short-term (through 2030), medium-term (by 2035), and long-term (2040s and beyond), focusing on clean vehicles and multimodal measures at local and national levels.

Georgia is well-positioned to reap the economic and environmental benefits of EVs. EVs are the most effective option for cutting road transport emissions, with rapid improvements in cost and performance driven by global battery innovation. Imports of affordable Chinese-made EVs are growing, but their high upfront costs remain a barrier. Given limited public budgets and household purchasing power, policies must prioritise the most economically viable use cases and ensure broad access to electrification. Sustaining momentum will require further differentiation of vehicle import duties, indexing fuel taxes to inflation, and mobilising low-cost international finance to support adoption.

The transition to electric mobility will be gradual, requiring a framework that balances fiscal sustainability, economic viability and social equity. The achievements of the past decade already provide a foundation for reform. Existing vehicle import duties should be modified to reflect differences in fuel efficiency and emissions, alongside stricter monitoring and enforcement of in-use vehicles. Circulation and fuel taxes should also be more closely aligned with national economic and environmental objectives, while targeted incentives for EVs and charging infrastructure will be essential to ensure Georgia benefits from the global shift to clean mobility.

Investments in diverse transport infrastructure can make Georgia’s cities more liveable and freight more efficient. Funding from institutions such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has been critical for upgrades to road infrastructure as well as the modernisation, extension and electrification of rail networks. It has also provided crucial financing for initiatives like Tbilisi’s Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan. In addition to financing and grants, international institutions – including the European Union, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the ADB – have offered policy and technical assistance. This support has bolstered government capacity, improved road safety and advanced the liberalisation of Georgian Rail, the state-owned national railway, while ensuring its fiscal sustainability.

Over the past decade, Georgia has secured significant funding and technical support from European and other multilateral development banks while awarding several large projects to cost-competitive firms, mainly from China. Recent examples include the Rikoti Pass along the country’s East-West Highway (with funding from the ADB and the European Investment Bank), and the Kvesheti-Kobi Road along the North-South Highway (with funding from the ADB and the EBRD).

Sustaining progress will require Georgia to align investment with national priorities, integrate more closely with European markets and court Chinese clean-tech partners in areas such as EVs and batteries. In the medium-to-long term, Georgia must also shift away from concessional finance from international institutions and develop new sources of domestic capital from both the public and private sectors to support cleaner and more efficient transport.

The recommended policies would advance integration with the European Union while delivering economic and social benefits. Over the past decade, Georgia has been steadily aligning its laws and regulations with those of the European Union. In 2014, the country signed an Association Agreement with the bloc, followed by accession to the Energy Community in 2017. In 2022, Georgia formally applied for European Union membership. Approval is by no means guaranteed, however, so it is important that Georgia pursue EU integration in a pragmatic way. Immediate benefits include regaining access to EU funding for national and local authorities and securing continued international financing for key energy, infrastructure and sustainable mobility projects. Over the long term, Georgia is well placed to benefit from EU industrial and climate policies, and to leverage its location, resources and workforce to develop advanced clean energy technologies for the European market.

Transport reforms already aligned with EU standards have improved health, quality of life and economic efficiency. Further integration can unlock opportunities for Georgia under the European Union’s industrial, economic development and environmental policies, such as the Social Climate Fund, Green Deal, “Fit for 55” and RePowerEU, as well as mechanisms like the Emissions Trading System (ETS), the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the Renewable Energy Directive. Georgia’s low-emissions electricity mix, competitive wages and position as a corridor between Asia and Europe make it well suited to low-carbon industries. Securing financing for a deep-sea port at Anaklia remains a priority. The project would ease cargo handling bottlenecks and allow Georgia to capitalise on its position as a transit hub between Asia and Europe. At the same time, it is critical that Georgia retains majority ownership of this key infrastructure asset and that the port development creates local jobs and delivers economic benefits.

This roadmap urges Georgia to press ahead with EU-aligned reforms while leveraging its clean energy and labour advantages to develop clean technology industries for export to Europe. It should also seek strategic partnerships with global leaders in areas such as EVs and batteries to strengthen domestic industrial capacity.

Beyond the specific measures summarised in the table above, this report highlights seven policies that should be considered at the national level:

Build government capacity for the transition: The new Interdepartmental Commission for the Development of the Transport and Logistics Sector of Georgia, established in August 2023, provides a platform for cross-agency coordination. It should set up working groups on key technologies, such as an EV taskforce. The national statistics agency, Geostat, should strengthen data collection, validation and public access to better inform policy. Policy should emphasise the economic, equity and industrial benefits of sustainable transport, with efficiency and electrification driving progress beyond energy and climate goals.

Revamp regulations and fiscal policy to spur road electrification: Fuel and vehicle taxes should be gradually adjusted to reduce dependence on imported oil. Phased reforms to the electricity sector can help capture the grid benefits of EVs, starting with flexible charging and eventually enabling additional grid services.

Mobilise climate finance and build a sustainable and resilient tax base: Adopt policies to attract climate finance, including concessional and blended funding, and explore joint tenders for electric buses. Develop a long-term, sustainable taxation framework to fund transport infrastructure, including freight corridors, multimodal urban transport, highways and the redesign of city streets. Align taxes with industrial and technology transition goals, and craft policies that encourage private investment, complemented by public funds when needed.

Invest in skills and education: Georgia has no dedicated funding for climate and energy research and development. The 2024 National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) initially aimed to increase investment and education reforms for clean technology, with a target budget of 1% of GDP for research, innovation and competition as well as EV infrastructure and training. Unfortunately, this goal – already insufficient for addressing Georgia’s energy and climate challenges – was removed from the final plan. Broader public education and support for independent, technically competent media are also needed to sustain long-term climate action and a just transition.

Create an expert task force on EVs: Rapid EV adoption is key to sustainable road transport, requiring strong grid and charging infrastructure. Coordination between the power and transport sectors is needed for grid connections, capacity upgrades, smart grids and strategic charging deployment. A multi-stakeholder task force – including ministries, regulators, utilities, industry, academia and civil society – should be established to oversee the transition.

Pursue clean technology partnerships: Georgia should use its renewable energy – especially hydropower – to expand biofuels manufacturing and attract clean technology, including EVs, green hydrogen derivatives and batteries. The country should leverage its access to the European market, explore ways to encourage Chinese investment and technology transfers, build local skills and ensure that government ministries and agencies engage with prospective partners in a coordinated manner.",https://iea.imgix.net/13a302b4-30be-4190-b2a8-88ec6092600a/shutterstock_2704940845.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=min&h=600&q=80&rect=251%2C0%2C533%2C533&w=1200,N,,2025-12-11 22:58:07.160055

“North Dakota is an energy-rich state,” Cummins says.
“The goal for the site over time and the goal for us in North Dakota is scale — be one of the leading places for AI infrastructure in the United States,” Cummins says.
It used to be data center regions were at the population centers.
There is a new facility being built in Iowa and also a potential project in South Dakota.","In September, Applied Digital broke ground on Polaris Forge 2, a 280-megawatt (MW) AI computing center in Harwood, north of Fargo in North Dakota. It’s a big project for a tech company whose market value has jumped dramatically in value in 2025.

“North Dakota is an energy-rich state,” Cummins says. “They produce six to eight times more energy than they consume inside of the state … And for North Dakota, the sites that we’ve located at typically have a significant amount of renewables. [The] sustainability factor is important to our company, and the carbon load that we create … We try to be driving efficiency through cold weather and then also sourcing power from the lowest-carbon source that we can.”

When asked what the long-term goals are for Polaris Forge 2, Cummins had one choice word: scale.

“That’s the goal in this industry in general — scale,” he says. “How quickly can we scale this project that has moved forward really fast?”

Outside of typical business market pressures in the tech industry, freezing spells also provide the imperative to move nimbly on large data center projects located in places that experience a very cold winter season like North Dakota, where foundations must be poured and set before construction can continue through colder months.

Cummins says Applied Digital is in advanced negotiations with a customer for Polaris Forge 2, lending to the company’s “data center region” it is now building out in the state.

“The goal for the site over time and the goal for us in North Dakota is scale — be one of the leading places for AI infrastructure in the United States,” Cummins says. “Data and regions are different now. It used to be data center regions were at the population centers. Now it’s data itself.”

As sustainability continues to grow in importance and popularity among several large development projects, there is some wariness when it comes to data centers, especially as it pertains to water usage. At Polaris Forge 2, a company-specific closed-loop liquid cooling system will cool the equipment.

“We specifically designed a closed-loop liquid cooling system,” Cummins says. “This is what most of the data center operators are going toward now, which is a much more environmentally friendly and much more sustainable way of running data centers because our entire data center campus will use the same amount of water a typical household would use.”

In a closed-loop liquid cooling system, the liquid being used to cool the equipment is circulated through a self-contained loop near the IT equipment that requires cooling. Water does not evaporate out in the air and need replacing as it does in an open-loop cooling system.

“We’ve made great strides there with customers,” Cummins says. He notes that Applied Digital is set to “turn on through the end of the year one of the largest supercomputing clusters in the world” and potentially have the “largest direct-to-chip liquid-cooling deployment in the world” in North Dakota.

Applied Digital will have three data centers in North Dakota after Polaris Forge 2 is operational, including a 106-MW facility (JMS01) in Jamestown and Polaris Forge 1, a 400-MW data center in Ellendale recently leased to AI cloud computing company CoreWeave. There is a new facility being built in Iowa and also a potential project in South Dakota.

Reaching for Renewables

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2024 South Dakota was second only to Vermont in having the highest share of total in-state electricity powered by renewable resources (81%). The natural geography and farmland-heavy industry of the state lends itself to renewable energy sectors (biomass, solar and wind) with hydroelectric options provided by the Missouri River.

POET, a Sioux Falls-based biofuel company specializing in bioethanol and operating over 30 facilities across the American Midwest and Heartland regions, is building a new energy storage facility near one of its existing plants in Big Stone City, South Dakota. Thermal battery manufacturer Antora and Minnesota utility service provider Otter Tail Power are partnering up on the development, coined the Big Stone Energy Storage Project.

Antora Energy Inc., a California startup backed by Bill Gates, develops thermal energy storage solutions using solid carbon blocks that are heated via electricity — the resulting energy produced by this technology creates steam that can be used to power equipment at different kinds of facilities. Sustainability initiatives and legislative changes at the state level helped incentivize the new POET project, which will also be the first time Antora’s thermal batteries will be used on a commercial scale.

POET was founded by Jeff Broin, whose father began exploring bioethanol production on their family farm in Wanamingo, Minnesota, in the 1980s. The company is still privately owned and operated by the Broin family and is now one of the largest ethanol producers in the country after launching its first commercial facility in 1986 in Scotland, South Dakota.

According to the Governor’s Office of Economic Development in South Dakota, the state has seen more than 40 energy-related or manufacturing projects advance over the past two years. Nearly $800 million is projected to be invested in manufacturing expansions and relocations, while energy-related projects are expected to generate almost $600 million in capital investment.

Philip Wind Partners, a subsidiary owned by Chicago-based Invenergy, is in talks with South Dakota regulators to establish a $750 million wind energy farm in the western area of the state. To be located on 70,000 acres in Haakon County, the Philip Wind Energy Center project is expected to generate 300 MW of electricity that will power over 121,000 homes and aims to begin operations in 2027.

Invenergy also received the OK earlier this year to build a 260-MW wind project in the northeastern part of South Dakota in Deuel County, named the South Deuel Wind Energy Center; Invenergy also built the first Deuel Harvest Wind Farm, which was completed and sold to Southern Power in 2021.",https://siteselection.com/media/Favicon-100x100.png,N,,2025-12-11 19:02:31.563405

It should be the people who use the roads,"" David Kline, a spokesperson for the California Taxpayer Association, told the outlet.
However, creating an environment where EV drivers are taxed 4 cents per mile probably isn’t going to encourage an uptick in sales.
At present, about 61 cents of every gallon of California gasoline comes from taxes designed to help maintain roads.
This calls into question the level of compliance the EV tax would ultimately receive.","California is presently considering a new tax on all-electric vehicles that would charge motorists a few cents per every mile driven. The idea is being pitched as a way to make up for lost revenues as more residents now drive EVs than ever before. But the initiative is getting some pushback from the locals as government action runs behind schedule.

On Monday, KMPH Fox 26 confirmed that the California Department of Transportation (or Caltrans) had nearly completed its pilot program to test the mileage charge and that residents and activists groups have concerns.

As tested, the fee would only amount to roughly 2 to 4 cents per mile. That equates to the average driver paying between $200 and $600 annually. Some would undoubtedly pay more, whereas others would pay less. However, the true average could be less due to the fact that EV drivers tend to drive fewer miles annually than individuals with gasoline-powered cars.

""Someone's got to pay for the roads. It should be the people who use the roads,"" David Kline, a spokesperson for the California Taxpayer Association, told the outlet.

“But how is it going to sort out when people who have long commutes, maybe live in areas of the state where the cities are very far apart, you know, they're going to start carrying a lot more of the burden, perhaps.”

Of all the states, California has the most all-electric vehicles by far. However, 80 percent of the region’s roadway maintenance is funded by taxes affixed to the sale of gasoline. While this is normal for most of the United States, California is worried that it’s going to be missing out on funding if its plan to become carbon neutral comes to fruition in 2045.

The state likewise still hopes to ban the sale of gasoline-powered automobiles by 2035. But the status of that scheme has become a bit more complicated. The White House has pivoted the United States away from subsidizing all-electric vehicles while doing what it can to revoke fuel waivers that previously allowed California enforce higher emission standards than federally required.

The state actually has a long history of being given special treatment. California fuel waivers originate with the 1967 Federal Air Quality Act, which gave it special dispensations to raise emission standards beyond national requirements to combat Los Angeles smog. This resulted in the creation of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which has likewise encouraged over a dozen other states to follow its guidance on emissions.

Board members are appointed, not voted on by the general public, and typically see long terms in office. But they are highly influential in regard to policy on both a state and national level. While Governor Gavin Newsom was the one to enact the concept of banning gasoline vehicles via executive order in 2020, it was CARB that pioneered the concept and finalized implementation. However, it does not appear to be involved in the mileage taxation plan in any meaningful way beyond setting the stage for EVs to replace combustion vehicles in California.

The governing board has seen some mild pushback over the years. In 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency (under the Bush administration) actually denied California’s waiver request for even stricter emissions. However, this was swiftly undone by the Obama administration while likewise overhauling federal standards — which included the footprint plan loophole that helped normalize massive SUVs and pickups.

Donald Trump has made it his mission to reduce California’s influence on U.S. emission standards since 2016 and even attempted to rollback fueling rules during his first term in the White House. This included a play to revoke the state’s existing waivers on the grounds that it was encouraging manufacturers to build vehicles the rest of the country would not buy.

The attempt failed after being mired in a deluge of lawsuits and any additional progress was undone by executive orders made by Joe Biden. However, the Trump administration’s second attempt — which launched earlier this year — appears to have been far more effective. The House has likewise voted to prevent California from implementing laws that would prohibit the sale of gasoline powered vehicles while the Senate supported ending its waivers.

With the above in mind, it seems like the proposed tax scheme could backfire. California leadership has made it crystal clear that it still intends on banning the sale of all gasoline-powered automobiles by 2035. In lieu of that, it still wants as many people buying all-electric models as possible. However, creating an environment where EV drivers are taxed 4 cents per mile probably isn’t going to encourage an uptick in sales.

That’s not to suggest a road tax isn’t necessary to help maintain roadways. EVs are almost always heavier than their internal combustion counterparts and therefore presumed to do more physical damage to roads per mile.

At present, about 61 cents of every gallon of California gasoline comes from taxes designed to help maintain roads. The assumption is that funding will dry up as more citizens buy EVs. While the mileage tax seems fair enough, there are some very valid concerns about how the state will monitor how much people are driving.

Privacy has become a major issue for some automotive enthusiasts, everyone who supports Right-to-Repair, and well-informed consumers. But it lacks the urgency of telling the average person that they might have to pay more for something, even if the end result is fundamentally the same.

One of the bigger perks of owning an EV is not having to purchase gasoline, which includes avoiding the relevant government fees. People rarely appreciate new taxes, even if it’s one of those rare instances where the money is supposed to go directly to maintaining the roads they’re actively using.

From KMPH Fox 26:

For example, if you live in Hanford and commute to and from Fresno 5 days a week with a Toyota Camry, you would have to pay just over $11 if the road tax is 3 cents.

""But now we're switching the burden to different people. So that becomes one of the big issues. Who's going to pay, and can they afford it?"" said Kline.

Caltrans is expected to release the results of this pilot program by this month.

Since we are one week into December, FOX26 reached out to Caltrans several times this week for comment.

Each time, the agency thanked FOX26 for my patience as they worked on a response.

While Mr. Klein seems to be missing the bigger picture regarding the way in which gasoline is already taxed based upon how much one drives, it seems reasonable that California would be similarly concerned with how implementation of the tax might turn people away from all-electric vehicles. That may explain why Caltrans has yet to release its full report. But it may likewise just be bureaucratic inefficiency slowing things down.

The state could also be having trouble determining the best way to enact the tax. It’s estimated that at least 4 percent of California drivers don’t bother registering their vehicles at all, with another 16-20 percent not bothering with insurance. Even among those that do comply with registration, over a quarter of the whole are said to update their paperwork months after it has expired. Similarly worth noting is the fact that California has a higher rate of residents registering vehicles outside of the state than the national average.

This calls into question the level of compliance the EV tax would ultimately receive. The fuel tax is practically mandatory, as it’s directly affixed to every drop of gasoline that’s sold within the state. If you want to drive your combustion vehicle, and haven’t converted it to biodiesel or built your own refinery, there’s no getting around it.

Coming up with a way to do the same with electricity will be more difficult, especially since the brunt of EV charging happens at home. The same goes for convincing a subset of drivers, who have managed to avoid paying driving fees for years, that this is something they’ll want to support.",https://cdn-fastly.thetruthaboutcars.com/media/2025/12/11/15011/social-45132775.jpg?size=1200x628,N,,2025-12-11 20:59:52.119620

Jeannie Salo is chief public policy officer at Schneider Electric.

President Donald Trump and his cabinet are serious about rapidly advancing artificial intelligence in America.

But the race for AI is a race for electrons. If the U.S. wants to make it on the podium, public and private sectors must come together to implement a Formula 1-style strategy for powering AI with speed, precision and teamwork.

The clock is ticking. Long-term, AI is set to drive as much as 50% of U.S. electricity demand growth between now and 2050, fueled by technological innovation and a usage boom. Short-term, our speed is hampered by infrastructure bottlenecks, long interconnection queues, as well as matrixed and outdated federal permitting roadblocks, all of which slow down our ability to address the growing electricity supply and demand gap.

The greatest hazard of all is our aging and analogue racetrack — the U.S. electric grid. It simply isn’t keeping pace technologically with what’s available today, let alone with the innovations of tomorrow.

By 2028, we’ll be at a critical inflection point. If the country does not act, energy supply won’t keep pace with demand. Schneider Electric’s internal forecasts alone showcase that by 2033, we could be looking at a 175-GW capacity shortfall or worse. Put simply, this shortfall approximates nearly one quarter of our country’s current power demand and is equivalent to the power used by 130 million homes. This is a dizzying (but not insurmountable) delta.

Many think the solution is to prioritize more supply. While important, that alone will not solve the ensuing shortfall. The time it takes for large new generation sources like solar farms, natural gas or a new nuclear facility to be built and then deliver electricity to our homes and businesses could take a decade or longer.

Bottom line? We need a Formula 1-style strategy for teamwork that is well supplied, highly organized and can work quickly and precisely to win the race. Plus, we need to execute precision “pit stops” along the way to optimize and maintain our 20th century grid, so it can immediately support growing 21st-century technological demands.

The White House acknowledged those realities in its AI Action Plan, released this summer, by explicitly calling out the infrastructure needed to achieve our AI goals. Going further, the Department of Energy issued a “Speed to Power” request for information this fall, seeking ideas and projects that can develop the energy grid at a speed that matches the pace of AI innovation.

Leaders in energy tech are prepared to suit up and line the track with new technology and gear in hand to optimize electrons immediately and accelerate our speed to power AI.

As one of the leading grid solutions companies, in addition to our partnership with AI chip manufacturer NVIDIA, Schneider Electric has unique insight into how to blend the AI innovation revolution with the realities of our current electricity system. This year alone, we announced a $700 million planned investment in the U.S. to boost manufacturing, much of which will help produce equipment that can help supplement the modernization of the grid and power AI data centers efficiently.

But private sector investment needs to be matched with federal action. In the spirit of precise Formula 1 teamwork, here’s how we advance AI:

Speed: By 2026, the federal government should use every lever to close the gap between demand and supply. First, that starts with building more AI-ready data centers on federal lands to stabilize the grid with on-site generation, storage and flexible demand. The administration has taken preliminary steps to that effect, but we need to accelerate. Now is the time to shift into overdrive.

Precision: Second, the White House should put the pedal to the metal on its efforts to drive a closer consortium of utilities, regulators and agencies that can reform utility incentives that value vital, urgent digital upgrades like advanced metering and distributed energy resource management systems that make grid management smarter and more efficient.

Teamwork: Third, Congress and the executive branch must work together to pass durable permitting reform. There’s already a broad bipartisan understanding that the time it takes to build energy infrastructure in this country is not aligned with the urgency required of 21st-century technologies. That said, interconnection delays can and should also be addressed now by the administration in the meantime. DOE and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should fast-track projects that pair new load with resilience measures — microgrids, storage and on-site generation. Facilities (public or private) that can give back to the grid in emergencies should move to the front of the line. This standard would turn the queue into a driver of reliability.

Planning: Fourth, the White House and Congress should act together to accelerate a plan for investing in critical domestic electrical and grid supply chains while optimizing new trade deals and executive orders to speed up reliable access and affordability of the materials we need to compete.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/qQ7nVnZhgIl6Rtm31M2_B1AoCp2ZCOks6JC3jQ4MumE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS90cmFuc21pc3Npb25fbW9vZHkuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-11 19:01:56.790455

Straus Center for Torah and Western Thought provided grants to several students with internships in the political arena, fostering a new generation of leaders dedicated to both public service and Jewish values. The Impact Office recently sat down with Talya Naggar (SCW ’27), a Scholar at Senator Joseph Lieberman–Mitzner Center for Public Service and Advocacy, to discuss her summer internship in the D.C. office of Congressman Randy Fine. She reflects on her work establishing a new congressional office, engaging with constituents and contributing to research on antisemitism and policy issues, and how this connects to her aspirations in public service.

What were your main responsibilities during your time on Capitol Hill?

Freshman year of Congress is, in many ways, comparable to the first day of school. What few realize is that there is no guidebook for a new member—especially for those entering via a special election. Newly elected members join their class months later than their peers, often while still campaigning or fundraising, and must quickly catch up.

In April 2025, Florida State Senator Randy Fine won a special election for Florida’s 6th Congressional District. I began my internship in early June, joining a brand-new office still finding its footing. My responsibilities spanned many typical intern tasks: supporting constituent relations by answering phones and drafting correspondence, assisting with press and communications through social media and the office newsletter, and managing operational logistics such as preparing the office for visitors and organizing Capitol tours. I personally led more than forty tours of the Capitol.

Because the office was newly established, I also took on additional tasks to help set it up: preparing rooms for painting, organizing layouts, bringing in artwork from the Florida House, reorganizing the office’s Capitol storage, and assisting with the website launch. I frequently consulted the Capitol information desk to clarify protocol and ran supply errands to ensure smooth office operations.

This internship offered a window not only into the daily work of a congressional office but also into the effort required to build one from the ground up. I saw firsthand the importance of teamwork, flexibility, and stepping in wherever help was needed.

What issues or projects did you focus on most closely?

While I engaged in a wide range of congressional office work, much of my research focused on antisemitism. Since Congressman Fine is Jewish and serves on the Education and Workforce Committee, I gathered data related to antisemitism in higher education and the workplace, supporting both hearings with university presidents and press responses.

When the Congressman joined the Foreign Affairs Committee, I contributed to preparing the office for work on international issues, particularly concerning Israel and antisemitism. This involved tracking relevant developments, engaging with interest groups, and building research foundations for the office’s new initiatives.

Another key part of my role was constituent relations. I frequently handled calls, many involving instances of hate or antisemitism, and learned to navigate them with patience, professionalism and empathy. Beyond listening, I directed constituents to appropriate resources and ensured their concerns were acknowledged.

Which skills did you improve or develop?

This internship strengthened both professional and interpersonal skills. Handling constituent relations taught me how to remain composed in challenging situations and how to guide callers toward constructive solutions. Leading Capitol tours honed my ability to connect with diverse audiences, from families with small children to elderly visitors, adapting each experience to their needs.

I also expanded my operational and research skills, becoming fluent in internal office data systems, managing logistical tasks and conducting policy research to support the Congressman’s priorities. In addition, I gained exposure to communications, including monitoring press coverage, assisting with social media and contributing to press releases.

What were some key lessons that you learned from the experience?

One of the most important lessons I learned was the value of a strong, cohesive team. Congressman Fine was able to make a rapid impact in Congress thanks to a committed team, from the chief of staff down to interns. At the time of the vote on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the congressman, along with the chief of staff and legislative director, were literally sleeping in the office. The intensity of the environment—shifting schedules, world leaders passing through and long hours—underscored the importance of teamwork and adaptability.

At the same time, juggling multiple responsibilities simultaneously, such as phone calls, press work, constituent visits and ad hoc tasks, was challenging. Learning to prioritize and remain focused under constant pressure was one of the most valuable aspects of the experience.

Why does this kind of work matter to you, and what would you say to other students considering a similar path?

I believe this work is vital because it demonstrates the tangible impact of public service. Working in a congressional office provides insight into how the institution functions daily, from committee hearings to constituent interactions. What I came to realize is that even the smallest moments can matter. A phone call with a constituent, a passing conversation with a staffer or even a discussion with another intern can carry weight. Many of the people you meet in these settings will go on to become decision makers in Washington and beyond, which makes it essential to stand by your beliefs and engage thoughtfully.

For students, such experiences highlight the importance of ensuring that every constituent’s voice is heard and of bringing one’s own perspective into the work. Internships like this not only offer a chance to serve but also deepen understanding of the political system—a foundation for those aspiring to future roles in public service. For me, G-d willing, this internship is the first step toward a career in public service, preparing me to engage meaningfully in policy and governance while supporting issues central to the Straus Center’s mission. It really means so much to have had the support of the Straus Center; I am very grateful.

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Early last year, the hydropower company Nature and People First set its sights on Black Mesa, a mountainous region on the Navajo Nation in northern Arizona. The mesa’s steep drop offered ideal terrain for gravity-based energy storage, and the company was interested in building pumped-storage projects that leveraged the elevation difference. Environmental groups and tribal community organizations, however, largely opposed the plan. Pumped-storage operations involve moving water in and out of reservoirs, which could affect the habitats of endangered fish and require massive groundwater withdrawals from an already-depleted aquifer.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has authority over non-federal hydropower projects on the Colorado River and its tributaries, ultimately denied the project’s permit. The decision was among the first under a new policy: FERC would not approve projects on tribal land without the support of the affected tribe. Since the project was on Navajo land and the Navajo Nation opposed the project, FERC denied the permits. The Commission also denied similar permit requests from Rye Development, a Florida-based company, that also proposed pumped-water projects.

Now, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright wants to reverse this policy. In October, Wright wrote to FERC, requesting that the commission return to its previous policy and that giving tribes veto power was hindering the development of hydropower projects. The commission’s policy has created an “untenable regime,” he noted, and “For America to continue dominating global energy markets, we must remove unnecessary burdens to the development of critical infrastructure, including hydropower projects.”

Wright also invoked a rarely used authority under the Federal Powers Act to request that the commission make a final decision no later than December 18. And instead of the 30 to 60 days generally reserved for proposed rule changes, the FERC comment period was open for only two weeks last month. If his effort proves successful, hydropower projects like the ones proposed by Nature and People First could make a return to the Navajo Nation regardless of tribal support.

More than 20 tribes and tribal associations largely in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest, environmental groups, and elected officials, including Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat from New Jersey, sent letters urging FERC to continue its current policy.

“Tribes are stewards of the land and associated resources, and understand best how to manage and preserve those resources, as they have done for centuries,” wrote Chairman William Iyall of the Cowlitz Indian Tribe in Washington in a letter submitted to the commission.

Tó Nizhóní Ání, or TNA, a Diné-led water rights organization based in Black Mesa on the Navajo Nation, also submitted comments opposing the proposed hydropower project. In the 1960s, after Peabody Coal broke up sections of the resource-rich region between the Hopi and Navajo tribes for mining, the company was accused of misrepresenting the conditions of its operations and the status of mineral rights to local communities. Environmental problems soon followed, as the company’s groundwater pumping exceeded legal limits, compromising the aquifer and access to drinking water. According to Nicole Horseherder, Diné, and TNA’s executive director, this led residents of Black Mesa to use community wells.

“They were now starting to have to haul all their water needs in this way,” she said. “That really changed the lifestyle of the people on Black Mesa.”

After the coal mines closed 20 years later, Black Mesa communities have focused on protecting their water resources while building a sustainable economy. But when Nature and People First’s founder Denis Payre presented the company’s plans, he seemed unaware of the tribes’ history in the region. During these presentations, Payre also made promises that if the company’s hydropower project went forward, it would benefit residents. The project would generate 1,000 jobs during construction and 100 jobs permanently, he claimed, and would help locals readily access portable drinking water.

“He wasn’t understanding that our region has a history of extraction, and that is coal mining and its impact on our groundwater,” said Adrian Herder, Diné, TNA’s media organizer. “It seemed like this individual was tugging at people’s heartstrings, [saying] things that people wanted to hear.”

If the commission decides to retract tribes’ ability to veto hydropower projects, it will mark a shift in the relationship between Indigenous nations and the federal government. Horseherder described such a move as the “first step in eroding whatever’s left between [these] relationships.” She is pessimistic about the commission’s decision and expects it will retract the current policy.

“The only thing I’m optimistic about is that Indigenous people know that they need to continue to fight,” she said. “I don’t see this administration waking up to their own mistakes at all.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP24054104220892.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-12-11 19:59:32.795171

However, this was exactly my experience during my week at the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP 30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), hosted in Belém, Brazil. My opportunity to attend was not by chance, but rather the result of my decision to apply to Dr. O’Reilly’s International Climate Governance class. The course teaches the history and mechanics of the UNFCCC climate change regime and the Paris Agreement, and prepares you to spend a week at the COP, observing the interplay between official Party negotiators, civil society, and observers.

COP 30 was a unique meeting compared to recent years, mostly because it was finally held in a “greener” country. With many ambitious items on the agenda, I focused on the negotiation process for the Gender Action Plan (GAP), an official UNFCCC text that sets out to promote and implement gender-responsive climate action. While I have done prior research on gender in an international context during my time at IU, I attended COP to understand the intersection of climate change and gender by following the GAP negotiations and getting interviews of women’s experiences in various leadership positions.

While in Belém, I attended numerous panels and events hosted by pavilions, the Women and Gender Constituency, or by other NGOs, all focused on the importance of gender-responsive climate action. Most of my highlights and “breakthroughs” for my research came from the interviews I conducted with women, ranging from an official Head of Delegation to women working in feminist grassroots organizations. Common themes emerged from their experiences, sometimes shocking, yet often unsurprising, as they recounted navigating patriarchal environments in pursuit of climate solutions.

Much of this effort, however, was not in vain. The GAP was officially adopted by the 194 countries in attendance and was more progressive than before. Civil society groups and negotiators shared their reflections with me, celebrating many successes while acknowledging the reality that much work remains. It was evident in the meetings that there is a current global wave of backtracking on gender progress. Parties such as Russia and the Holy See continued to stall negotiations to dispute already agreed-upon terms, and the concept of “intersectionality” in relation to gender and climate change now appears to be more idealistic than realistic.

I am incredibly grateful for the experience I had at COP 30. Despite the general discourse that this COP was less ambitious than it originally sought to be, I left with more reassurance in the UNFCCC system to address climate change. Although the urgency of climate change is critical, the process to address it must be a marathon, not a sprint.

Having forums like the COP allowed me, a student observer, to meet trailblazing feminist activists leading civil society and inspiring current and former Party negotiators. This experience was truly remarkable and left a lasting impression on me. Attending COP 30 has led me to consider pursuing a career in the climate field, where I can integrate the interests and skills I developed while studying international affairs at Hamilton Lugar School, since ultimately, all issues are connected to climate change.

I would like to thank Dr. O’Reilly for allowing me to take part in this opportunity and for her guidance.

Offshore wind farms are typically connected to land via extensive submarine AC export cables, which can stretch over 100 km. These cables exhibit high capacitance, and could remain substantially charged, potentially leading to electrical discharge currents that can exceed 1000 A. To manage reactive power, fixed or variable shunt reactors are commonly integrated at one or both ends of the cable. The interplay between this inherent cable capacitance and the inductance of shunt reactors profoundly influences the performance of conventional relay protection IEDs.

Several factors compound these protection complexities:

High cable capacitance and charging currents: The high capacitance of long export cables generates high capacitive charging currents, which can desensitize traditional line differential protection (87L) functions.

Non-linear wind turbine generator (WTG) fault response: Modern WTGs, predominantly Type IV machines, utilize full converter-based technology. Unlike conventional synchronous generators, these inverter-based sources exhibit highly non-linear source impedance and limit fault current contributions to typically 1.1-1.3 p.u or less. This controlled fault current injection results in dynamic variations in sequence component voltage and current angles, posing challenges for directional protection elements.

Ringing-down phenomenon: The resonant interaction between cable capacitance and shunt reactor inductance during circuit breaker operations creates transient oscillations. These ""ringing-down"" transients can lead to unintentional tripping of protection relays, particularly during cable de-energization.

Inhomogeneous cable sequence impedance: Export cables often comprise multiple sections with varying designs, cross-sections, and bonding methods, resulting in non-uniform sequence impedance along their length. This inhomogeneity affects both accurate impedance measurements for distance protection and charging current compensation methods for differential protection.

Transformer connection and grounding: The connection group and grounding configurations of power transformers at the cable ends impact zero-sequence impedance and fault current distribution, potentially lowering short-circuit current levels.

Variable short-circuit contribution from the grid: Both strong and weak grid conditions influence the response of protection functions and the infeed ratio between the grid and the wind farm, affecting sensitivity and coordination.

Traditional protection schemes, such as classic line differential protection, often require high minimum differential current settings (up to 150 percent) for complex systems due to inherent assumptions, thereby reducing sensitivity. Furthermore, Charging Current Compensation (CCC) functions, while intended to address high charging currents, can be challenging to apply and may lead to maloperation, especially in complex export cable systems. Distance protection schemes also face difficulties with large cable capacitance, ringing-down phenomena, and the atypical fault response from WTG converters.

Adaptive Protection: A Breakthrough in Line Differential Protection

Hitachi Energy's Adaptive Model-Based Line Differential Protection, integrated into the Relion RED670 IED, represents a significant leap forward in power system protection. This innovative solution is rooted in a fundamentally different approach: the creation of a digital replica of power system components through complex non-linear mathematical models. This enables more secure and sensitive protection by reducing assumptions about the transient behaviors of complex configurations during disturbances.

The principles behind: The core of this innovation lies in its ability to model the complex, non-linear behavior of power system components when connected in intricate configurations. The system incorporates detailed information about each component within the protected object, such as various cable sections with differing parameters and fixed or variable shunt reactors. These elements are precisely represented using sequence matrices, forming a comprehensive dynamic model of the entire export cable system.

This dynamic mathematical model, coupled with local current and voltage measurements, enables the system to accurately estimate the expected remote-end phase currents that would flow out of a healthy export cable. This capability is crucial for precise charging current compensation when comparing these estimated values with the actual phase currents received from the remote IED via a high-speed communication link (2Mbits/sec). The result is a highly sensitive and secure model-based differential protection that operates effectively regardless of the export cable's properties.

Key advantages:

Enhanced sensitivity and safety: Unlike classic line differential protection, which often requires a high minimum differential current setting (up to 150 percent) for complex systems, the model-based approach significantly increases sensitivity and safety. This is demonstrated through differential current pickup settings as low as 25-75 percent in the model-based approach, compared to 150 percent in classic systems.

Superior Charging Current Compensation: The model-based approach inherently provides precise charging current compensation, leading to negligible differential current before a fault, even with high charging currents. This contrasts with the classic 87L, where the charging current significantly influences the pre-fault differential current.

Robustness to ringing-down phenomenon: The model-based 87L function effectively handles the ringing-down phenomenon, quickly recognizing that differential currents are practically zero despite high charging currents during energization, preventing spurious tripping.

Adaptive to WTG characteristics: The solution enhances stability against variations in source impedance from the wind farm side by utilizing zero-sequence-based criteria, which are more suitable for ground faults (the most common failure mode for ECs).

What’s going on: In a recent op-ed, Saint-Gobain North America CEO Mark Rayfield discusses manufacturing’s status as a major economic engine—but says that to maintain that distinction, the sector “will need to fill 3.8 million manufacturing jobs over the next decade” (citing a joint study from Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute, the NAM’s 501(c)3 workforce development and education affiliate).

If current trends continue, 1.9 million roles could go unfilled, Rayfield continued, again citing the MI/Deloitte study.

Why it’s happening: “For years, students have been steered toward four-year degrees, while trade careers, especially in manufacturing, have been overlooked or stigmatized,” Rayfield writes.

In fact, just 12% of American students have actually visited a manufacturing facility, according to the MI.

The fix: To fill those roles, Saint-Gobain North America recently launched the workforce development program “ Sustaining Futures, Raising Communities,” which “gives students a chance to explore immersive manufacturing environments with a focus on plant jobs that do not require an advanced degree,” according to the company.

The company is already seeing some success from the program, Rayfield writes in Newsweek.

The awards from the NC Department of Environmental Quality will fund 58 water, wastewater and septic system projects in 26 western North Carolina counties. North Carolina is the first state affected by Hurricane Helene to make awards provided through the 2025 State Revolving Fund Supplemental Appropriations for Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Hawai’i Wildfires.

A key requirement to receive funding is that a project must strengthen the system’s long-term resilience to future flooding.

“Hurricane Helene laid bare North Carolina’s need to upgrade its water infrastructure,” said Governor Josh Stein. “I applaud the Department of Environmental Quality’s quick work to award this funding faster than any other Helene-impacted state. Making these investments today makes us more resilient in the face of future disasters.”

“Safe drinking water and healthy waterways are basic necessities for health and quality of life,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. “Hurricane Helene inflicted serious damage to water systems, imperiling water supplies throughout our mountain communities. These awards will help communities rebuild to ensure that systems are less vulnerable to future flooding.”

Projects include:

Chimney Rock Village (in Rutherford County) will receive $2,706,162 for a drinking water system resiliency project, $5,000,000 for a new wastewater treatment plant and sewer resiliency improvements, and $4,163,192 to extend sewer lines to connect homes with septic systems.

Helene SRF funding for drinking water and clean water projects is available to local government units and nonprofit water corporations (and investor-owned drinking water corporations for the DWSRF) in the form of zero-interest loans and principal forgiveness. Applicants must document impacts from Hurricane Helene, and the proposed project must include resiliency with the purpose of reducing flood damage risk and vulnerability to rapid hydraulic change or natural disasters.

Clean Water SRF Helene funding for septic systems is available to local government units, nonprofit water corporations, Community Development Financial Institutions and nonprofit organizations that finance homeowner repairs of septic systems. The funding is offered in the form of principal forgiveness loans and must be used to improve flood resilience to septic systems in Helene-affected areas and/or to connect homes on septic systems to public sewer systems.

The Division of Water Infrastructure conducted four preliminary SRF Helene information sessions for prospective western North Carolina applicants in May in Boone, Hickory, Rutherfordton and Asheville. These were followed by in-person application trainings, related to applying for SRF Helene funds, in July and August in Clyde, Hickory, Boone, and Research Triangle Park/Durham. A virtual option was also offered, and a recording of the training is posted on the Division’s training web page. Additionally, in September, the Division offered an SRF Helene funding application webinar to interested parties to learn about funding and how to apply for it.

GE Vernova expects revenues in its fast-growing electrification segment to rise around 25% in 2025 and about 20% in 2026, company officials said in an annual investor update Tuesday.

Driving the increase is an electrification “supercycle” that will see electricity’s share in final energy consumption grow significantly in the years and decades ahead, CEO Scott Strazik said Tuesday.

A slide deck accompanying remarks by Strazik and Ken Parks, the company’s chief financial officer, said GE Vernova expects the current quarter to be its largest for electrical equipment orders direct to hyperscaler tech companies.

So far this quarter, the company said, customers in Europe, North America, the Middle East and Australia have booked orders for data center equipment, high-voltage direct-current infrastructure and synchronous condensers, which maintain inertia on grids with high shares of variable renewable generation.

“Every 90 days, I have that much more conviction on what we’re creating in our electrification business,” Strazik said, referring to the standard corporate quarterly earnings reporting cycle.

GE Vernova’s pending acquisition of Prolec GE will increase its exposure to markets for lower-voltage electrical equipment across broader geographies, Strazik added. He said the $5.3 billion deal for GE Vernova’s 50-50 joint venture with Mexican industrial conglomerate Grupo Xignux remains on track to close in mid-2026.

Strong gas turbine orders and pricing

GE Vernova’s Power segment backlog continues to expand thanks to strong demand for its gas turbines. It has booked 18 GW of turbine orders thus far in the fourth quarter and expects to end 2025 with an 80-GW backlog that stretches into 2029, according to the company. Pricing remains strong, with new reservations pricing above current orders.

GE Vernova reiterated its guidance for 20 GW of annualized turbine production by mid-2026 and said it could stretch production at its two existing facilities to annualized production of 24 GW by mid-2028. Strazik said he expects turbine reservations to be sold out through 2030 by the end of 2026.

Strazik and Parks talked up the more efficient, higher-capacity turbine models that large gas-fired power plants favor, but they said data centers and other energy-intensive customers are also interested in older, smaller aeroderivative models to supply “bridge power” for new facilities. The company will split the planned 4 GW of new production capacity roughly evenly between the French factory that makes those turbines and the South Carolina plant that makes the larger models, they said.

Large customers increasingly appear willing to provide GE Vernova with visibility into their ordering plans over the next five to 10 years, Strazik said.

“We are having healthy conversations in this vein with the hyperscalers” that could lead to “volume agreements” stretching out as far as 2035, he said. He predicted at least one such deal would materialize next year.

With the company expecting to have $16 billion in cash available for deployment by 2028, could longer-term demand visibility push GE Vernova to make a significant investment in new production? Strazik didn’t rule that out. But he said it wasn’t a decision the company needed to make soon.

“We do not anticipate having to address this in the next 18 months,” he said.

Wind business ‘still soft’

Wind remains the weakest of GE Vernova’s three business lines despite improved year-over-year performance. The presentation deck blamed “tariff uncertainty and permitting” for keeping a lid on orders, even as Strazik said customers have safe-harbored around 10 GW of capacity to ensure eligibility for the investment and production tax credits that were sunsetted by the budget bill President Donald Trump signed this summer.

“It is still soft relative to the potential of what it could be over time,” Strazik said of the segment.

By 2028, Strazik said, GE Vernova’s installed turbine base should approach 30 GW, much of it eligible for repowering orders that the company could fill. The company’s onshore wind business looks set to resolve around an annualized rate of 4 GW by then, though that forecast could prove conservative if orders reach an “inflection,” he added.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/SKy5k6wy0BUdWFbVI8_Vezpxm20lGWQLMBhPIHJ5x8c/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9fZ2VfdmVybm92YV9ncmVlbnZpbGxlX2ZhY3RvcnkuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-11 18:00:26.121854

A new survey from the National Association of Realtors found that businesses are focused on energy efficiency when purchasing or leasing commercial property. The responses came from over 2,000 realtors, more than half of whom reported that promoting a building’s energy efficiency is valuable when listing it. Similarly, a third of realtors said green building certifications increased commercial property value.

While 70% of respondents said clients found utility and operations costs to be important considerations, only 27% said clients were focused on renewable energy systems such as solar and geothermal. Even still, 35% of realtors said it was important to understand how solar panels impact a real-estate transaction. Behind-the-meter solar infrastructure that directly powers buildings can lower utility bills, as can net metering, and proper insulation prevents heat or cooling loss.

In a recent House hearing on energy efficiency, hearing witness Kara Saul Rinaldi, chief policy officer of the Building Performance Association, said that energy efficiency can guarantee building longevity and support the grid.

“Energy efficiency in buildings and appliances lowers costs for families and businesses,” Rinaldi said during the hearing. “Advancing energy efficiency across the US reduces demand on our energy system.”

Beyond lowering energy bills and aiding the grid, a new report from the Building Performance Association also found rising employment as a result of green building construction and upgrading existing structures. The energy-efficiency industry is “creating more jobs than any other energy sector” and the number of energy-efficiency jobs has “nearly doubled since 2021.” What’s more, energy efficiency is the “largest energy sector” in most states.

Although the sector continues to throw points on the board, an energy-efficiency home improvement tax credit created by the Inflation Reduction Act is about to be phased out as part of Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill. But an executive from an energy-efficient home appliance company told Tech Brew that higher energy prices will make energy-saving devices more attractive, even without the tax credits.

“A variety of actions that the administration is taking are expected to drive up prices in ways that have the potential to be pretty significant,” Michael Rigney, CEO of smart heat pump company Cala Systems, told Tech Brew over the summer. “That’s going to make the savings even bigger.

Tesla's U.S. sales have hit a three-year low despite the introduction of more affordable models.

The discontinuation of federal tax credits has impacted the broader electric vehicle market.

Tesla's stock saw a minor decline of approximately 1% following these developments.

Tesla's (TSLA, Financial) sales in the United States experienced a significant drop, reaching their lowest point in nearly three years last month. This decline occurred even though the company introduced cheaper models of its popular electric vehicles. According to estimates by Cox Automotive, the overall electric vehicle market has struggled since the $7,500 federal tax credits were discontinued by the Trump administration at the end of September. As a result of these developments, Tesla's stock experienced a decline of approximately 1% at the market's close.

Tesla Inc, a vertically integrated battery electric vehicle automaker, is also a developer of real-world artificial intelligence software, which includes autonomous driving and humanoid robots. The company boasts a diverse fleet of vehicles, including luxury and midsize sedans, crossover SUVs, a light truck, and a semi-truck. Tesla's ambitions extend to selling a sports car and offering a robotaxi service. In 2024, global deliveries were slightly below 1.8 million vehicles. Beyond vehicles, Tesla sells batteries for stationary storage for residential and commercial properties, including utilities, and offers solar panels and solar roofs for energy generation. The company also owns a fast-charging network and an auto insurance business.

“Ongoing research and new information is quite promising and may lead to improvements in wind farm design which can decrease turbulence and thus increase predictable electric power production in the future.
“The major concern with wind power as well as solar is the unavoidably intermittent nature of production,” he said.
“Those first-generation West Texas wind farms helped put our state on the national map for renewable energy.
“In some Texas wind farms, particularly the older ones, these wake losses can approach 30–35% of the power that would otherwise be produced.","Mulling a problem with the positioning of wind turbines and the production decrease resulting from the turbulence within wind farms, the question has arisen whether they will ever be as valuable a contributor to the electric grid as they were originally hyped to be.

The turbulence cuts production by 30-35 percent of what would it be if the turbines were more cannily spaced and it is said to be an issue of computational fluid dynamics that was not understood when the wind farms were built.

Waco economist Ray Perryman and Odessa oilman Kirk Edwards say the problem is challenging.

“This issue has been around for several years,” Perryman said. “Ongoing research and new information is quite promising and may lead to improvements in wind farm design which can decrease turbulence and thus increase predictable electric power production in the future.

In fact there are times when wind is the leading source of electricity for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. It can even provide all the power on the grid on mild spring and fall days.”

Even in August, Perryman said, wind and solar power comprised more than 25% of the net electricity generated in ERCOT.

“The major concern with wind power as well as solar is the unavoidably intermittent nature of production,” he said. “We remain a long way from having sufficient battery capacity or other storage mechanisms in place to meet demand at times when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.

“As a result there will be a need for sufficient baseline capacity which uses conventional fuels, primarily natural gas, for the foreseeable future.”

Perryman said wind power clearly has an important role to play and the more effective future wind farm design can be the more helpful wind will be as a source of electric power to serve the growing population and economy of Texas.

“As demand accelerates with the increase in AI, data centers, chip plants, crypto mining and other power-intensive activities, the demand for power is expanding rapidly,” he said. “An ‘all of the above’ strategy to meet energy needs is essential.”

Edwards said the hidden problems of wind farms can no longer be ignored.

“Texas was an early pioneer in large-scale wind power,” he said. “Those first-generation West Texas wind farms helped put our state on the national map for renewable energy.

“But as the industry has matured so have the challenges and many of the problems built into those early projects are still with us today.”

Edwards said one of the most significant issues is something called “wake loss.”

“When wind turbines are placed too closely together each machine creates turbulence that slows and disrupts the airflow for the next one,” he said. “In some Texas wind farms, particularly the older ones, these wake losses can approach 30–35% of the power that would otherwise be produced.

“The physics were understood, but the computational tools to accurately model turbine interactions simply didn’t exist two decades ago. As a result we’re left with farms whose layouts permanently limit their performance.”

Edwards said retrofitting them is impractical and moving massive towers spaced across thousands of acres is uneconomic.

“Newer wind developments, especially offshore, are better optimized,” he said. “With modern modeling and far more land or sea room developers can space turbines more effectively and reduce internal losses.

“But that doesn’t solve the other issues facing Texas like local ‘not in my backyard’ opposition, environmental impacts and the long-term land obligations that remain unresolved.”

Edwards said bird and bat mortality around turbines is still a hot button concern.

“Even more troubling is the looming question of end-of-life cleanup,” he said. “These towers and blades will not last forever and decommissioning them will require heavy equipment, specialized disposal and millions in remediation costs.

“In the oil and gas industry operators must post bonds and carry long-term liabilities to ensure that sites are restored. The wind industry has no such statewide mechanism and that bill will come due.”

Edwards said the challenges that these intermittent resources create for the Texas electric grid also cannot be ignored.

“Transmission capacity is finite,” he said. “When wind farms occupy significant grid space only to deliver little or no power on the hottest or coldest days exactly when Texans need electricity the most, that capacity is effectively stranded.

“It could have been used for 24/7 dispatchable generation like natural gas, coal or nuclear power. Wind can contribute to our energy mix, but it cannot replicate the reliability of those baseload resources.”

Noting that Texas has always been pragmatic about energy, Edwards said honest conversations are needed as the state looks to the future about the real limitations of wind power and the long-term liabilities and importance of keeping dependable generation at the center of the grid.

“Renewable energy has a role to play, but reliability, responsibility and transparency must come first,” he said.",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/122721_OilArt_04-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 18:01:16.425118

The “PERMIT Act” passed 221-205.
Sponsored by Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee Chair Mike Collins (R-Ga.) and Graves, the bill would end protections under the Clean Water Act for ephemeral streams and limit states’ ability to block energy projects due to water quality concerns.
Another provision would make it harder for individuals, municipalities and advocacy groups to sue over unauthorized water pollution discharges.
“I will be the first to admit [the Clean Water Act] needs reforms, but this bill is not it,” said Rep.

The “PERMIT Act” passed 221-205. The vast majority of Democrats voted against it, but six — Reps. Sanford Bishop (D-N.C.), Jim Costa (D-Calif.), Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), Donald Davis (D-N.C.), Adam Gray (D-Calif.) and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) — voted yes. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) was the only Republican to vote no.

During floor debate, Democrats sought to characterize the bill as a threat to affordability and a handout to industry. Republicans described the changes as commonsense reforms necessary to accelerate permitting.

“The bottom line is that without reforming the Clean Water Act, America cannot efficiently build roads, bridges, pipelines, ponds, dams, levees, airports, homes, farms and other infrastructure we need,” said Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

Sponsored by Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee Chair Mike Collins (R-Ga.) and Graves, the bill would end protections under the Clean Water Act for ephemeral streams and limit states’ ability to block energy projects due to water quality concerns.

It would establish strict timelines for when environmental groups could file a lawsuit challenging a permit authorizing the destruction of wetlands.

Another provision would make it harder for individuals, municipalities and advocacy groups to sue over unauthorized water pollution discharges.

In addition, the bill would codify the Army Corps of Engineers’ issuance of streamlined nationwide permits for oil and gas pipelines and restrict EPA’s ability to override wetlands pollution permits issued by the Army Corps.

Supporters on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee touted provisions in the bill that they said would help small businesses.

“My colleagues across the aisle continue to promote the fallacy that improving permitting processes comes at the expense of the environment,” said Rep. Dave Taylor (R-Ohio).

“This legislation will provide much-needed regulatory certainty for America’s farmers, small businesses manufacturers, home and road builders, and many others.”

But Democrats opposing the bill said it would do little to advance permitting and would come at a steep cost to communities, who could be forced to pay for expensive drinking water treatment systems if water pollution increases.

“I will be the first to admit [the Clean Water Act] needs reforms, but this bill is not it,” said Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Mich.). “This bill would shift costs from polluters to rural America, tribes and disadvantaged communities.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/73/b3/2e2ad77347ccbe47a932bb412746/graves.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 20:59:56.536970

SK On posted an operating loss of 124.8 billion won ($84.72 million) for the July-September period, nearly double the 66.4 billion won loss in the previous quarter due to slowing EV battery shipments.

In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that electric-car sales could fall by around 50% following the Sept. 30 expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for buyers.

SEOUL - South Korean battery maker SK On said on Thursday that it has decided to end its joint venture with Ford Motor or their joint battery factories in the U.S. as part of a business overhaul to focus on growth areas like energy storage systems.

The split marks a reset for one of the major U.S. electric vehicle battery partnerships, coming as slowing EV demand and the loss of U.S. subsidies push South Korean battery makers to reshape their U.S. strategies and accelerate expansion into the energy storage systems business.

SK On, a subsidiary of SK Innovation , which supplies automakers including Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp., said a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will assume full ownership and operate the Tennessee plant.

Ford said on Thursday that it was aware of SK On's disclosure but declined to comment further.

""The production start schedule for the Tennessee plant remains flexible at this time, as it is related to the ownership transition,"" SK On said.

'Writing was on the wall'

The reaction to the news from Wall Street was one of expectation.

“We believe the writing was on the wall this partnership was not going to work moving forward,” Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, told the Detroit Free Press. “Ford has to make some difficult moves and this was a smart strategic one to rip the bandaid off. The EV market is dramatically scaled down for Ford now and they have to adjust accordingly.”

Morningstar's David Whiston said with EV volumes expected to be much lower than they were when the joint-venture was first announced, ""one or both parties want to end the relationship.""

""There could be different use cases now with lower volume, such as energy storage, that maybe Ford did not want to pursue but that’s speculation on my part,"" Whiston told the Detroit Free Press. ""SK can use the factory for other things or to sell batteries to multiple automakers to make better use of the capital invested.""

Conrad Layson, senior analyst for alternative propulsion at AutoForecast Solutions, said of the three South Korean battery companies, SK On is the most financially stretched.

“They have lost over $129.9 million in the first half of 2025 alone,” Layson said. “Almost all of it is attributable to reduced or eliminated EV battery cell demand and deliveries from their Ford partner.”

Layson said SK On has to decide what to do with their Tennessee facility, which will most likely be converted to supply energy storage system (ESS) cells.

“Though that will require more capital expenditure to replace the equipment installed to produce EV cells with equipment optimized to produce ESS cells. They have to find or allocate capital to do that and we haven’t seen many announcements from SK On gaining business in the ESS space,” Layson said.

He added that ending BlueOval SK isn’t a complete surprise to anyone, but “How it ends will have a greater impact on SK On, not Ford.”

SK On restructures to fix financials

In 2022, SK On and Ford invested $11.4 billion to build the joint battery plants in the United States.

SK On said the move reflected a strategic overhaul of assets and capacity aimed at enabling it to respond more quickly to market changes, accelerate its North American energy storage system business, and strengthen productivity and cost competitiveness in its battery operations.

The company said the restructuring is expected to improve its financial structure and profitability by sharply reducing debt and cutting fixed costs.

SK On posted an operating loss of 124.8 billion won ($84.72 million) for the July-September period, nearly double the 66.4 billion won loss in the previous quarter due to slowing EV battery shipments.

EV sales plummet

In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that electric-car sales could fall by around 50% following the Sept. 30 expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for buyers.

SK On has been expanding into the energy storage system business to offset weaker EV demand. In September, the company signed a deal with U.S.-based Flatiron Energy Development to supply lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems.

Other South Korean battery makers, including LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, have also been repurposing EV battery production lines to produce energy storage systems due to the phasing out of U.S. subsidies.

Energy storage batteries have a similar chemistry to automotive batteries and are used to power facilities such as data centers.

Kentucky utilities have recently proposed and received approval to build billions of dollars of new natural gas-fired power plants to largely meet projected power demand from prospective data centers.","A new study says Kentucky ratepayers could save billions of dollars through 2050 if electric utilities invested more in renewable energy and energy storage, retired “uneconomic” and aging coal-fired power plants, and avoided overbuilding natural gas-fired power.

The 65-page study, published Thursday and written by the consulting firm Current Energy Group, also says two Kentucky laws passed by the General Assembly in recent years restrict the retirements of aging coal-fired power plants and could “reduce or eliminate potential savings and lock Kentucky into a higher-risk, fossil-fuel-dependent future.”

The report was commissioned by the environmental legal groups Kentucky Resources Council and Earthjustice along with the Berea-based Mountain Association and the Louisville-based Metropolitan Housing Coalition.

Ashley Wilmes, the executive director of Kentucky Resources Council, during a press briefing Thursday said her group wanted an “unbiased” study to challenge assumptions embedded in Kentucky laws passed in recent years “that moving forward with cleaner energy is more expensive and less dependable.”

“Here in Kentucky, coal was the least-cost way to produce electricity, but as our coal plants age and as the cost of renewable energy continues to fall, that’s simply no longer the case,” Wilmes said. “Continuing to rely on aging, uneconomic power plants simply leads us to less stable, less dependable and higher-cost electricity when compared to the other pathways that are modeled in our report.”

Using an open source electricity planning model, the report analyzes four pathways that Kentucky utilities could take. The analysis considered pending proposals to build new power plants and other planning documents filed by utilities. It found the least-cost pathway creates up to $2.6 billion in savings for ratepayers through 2050 by replacing coal-fired power with “clean energy resources,” primarily solar power paired with batteries to store the power.

The report also analyzes the impacts of Kentucky laws — Senate Bill 4 in 2023 and Senate Bill 349 in 2024 — passed by the GOP-controlled legislature that impose barriers to retiring fossil fuel-fired power plants. The laws define “dispatchable” energy in ways that limit utilities’ ability to replace coal-fired power plants with anything other than natural gas-fired power, the report says.

In 2024, Senate Bill 349 also created a commission that reviews requests from utilities to retire fossil fuel-fired power before such a request reaches the Kentucky Public Service Commission, the state’s long-time utility regulator. Republican lawmakers who supported the laws generally cited the need to maintain coal-fired power because of electricity reliability fears after Winter Storm Elliott in 2022. Those concerns conflicted with testimony from executives with Kentucky’s largest utility showing coal-fired power plants had significant failures during that winter storm.

Tony Curtis, the executive director of the Metropolitan Housing Coalition, during the press briefing said there are “real housing, economic, environmental and health consequences for low and fixed-income households because of the policy path enacted by the Kentucky legislature.”

“Households may have to devote more of their working time to pay these bills during the hottest parts of the summer or the coldest parts of the winter, when the danger of a missed payment and utility disconnection is heightened,” Curtis said. “It is clear that Senate Bill 4 and Senate Bill 349, do not create safer, more stable, affordable or resilient households across the Commonwealth.”

A spokesperson for the Republican caucus in the Kentucky Senate did not immediately have a response Thursday afternoon to the report’s findings.

Going forward with plans and requests that utilities have already filed with the Public Service Commission could pose significant financial risk if natural gas prices significantly increase or carbon dioxide emissions from plants are more heavily regulated in the future, the report says. Kentucky utilities have recently proposed and received approval to build billions of dollars of new natural gas-fired power plants to largely meet projected power demand from prospective data centers.

Byron Gary, an attorney for the Kentucky Resources Council, pointed to the price volatility of natural gas after the outbreak of the war between Ukraine and Russia as an example of how global markets can impact the fuel. He said while there is upfront investment to build renewable energy such as solar farms, the long-term operating cost tends to be lower and is a known quantity unlike natural gas prices.

“This is that sort of market dynamic that you face when you put all of your eggs in one basket that also requires you to keep paying over time,” Gary said. “We could build instead resources that, once they are built, we know how much they are going to cost to run.”

The report also criticizes shortcomings in the long-term planning process of utilities, stating Kentucky utilities “continue to favor large, capital-intensive fossil fuel projects that align with the older resource-planning paradigm of a slower-moving industry.” This is despite, the report authors wrote, a “faster pace of changes” in the electricity industry that are providing new solutions and reducing technology costs.

Gary said he hopes the report can be a “first step to pointing out a more comprehensive alternative for the future” to avoid paying billions of dollars more because of shortcomings in the long-term planning of utilities. He compared energy planning by utilities to turning a ship.

“It’s a big ship, so making a hard right turn is difficult,” Gary said. “But I still maintain some hope that this is a good first step, just pointing out an alternative future.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1692-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 18:00:28.882240

AFP Chief Government Affairs Officer Brent Gardner issued the following statement:

America needs to build more energy infrastructure, faster, and the PERMIT Act will help bring common sense to a permitting process that for too long has stifled investment and increased costs needlessly. We applaud House leadership for prioritizing our ability to unlock more affordable energy as American families and businesses are using more power every day.

Next week, Republicans and Democrats should work together to pass H.R. 4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, and send these bills to the Senate and then on to President Trump to help America build again and win the race to global energy dominance.

Why Energy Abundance Matters for Affordability

Energy prices impact virtually everything people buy and need on a day-to-day basis. A lack of reliable, affordable, and abundant energy means even small price spikes send shockwaves through our economy with devastating consequences for other Americans—such as our farmers, who rely heavily on energy for every step of the process that helps produce, store, deliver food to our tables. When their costs go up, inevitably the costs of shipping and selling groceries also rise.

In September, Americans for Prosperity launched the national Road to Prosperity campaign to help unleash America’s potential by elevating the critical need for permitting reform. AFP hosted events in nearly a dozen states including visiting a power plant in Kentucky, an oil rig in Louisiana, a coal mine in Pennsylvania, an iron mine in Minnesota, an oil and gas processing site in Wyoming, a roundtable about coal in Ohio, and more events in Wisconsin, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Texas, and Utah. Follow along as the tour continues in 2026.

Through broad-based grassroots outreach, Americans for Prosperity (AFP) is driving long-term solutions to the country’s biggest problems. AFP activists engage friends and neighbors on key issues and encourage them to take an active role in building a culture of mutual benefit, where people succeed by helping one another.

The company has completed nearly 5,700 hours of 24/7 processing at its RapidSX™ Demonstration Plant in Kingston, Ontario, testing tonnes of U.S.-friendly mixed rare earth feedstock. The results, Ucore says, validate its ability to cleanly and efficiently separate rare earth oxides—including dysprosium, terbium, gadolinium, and other mid-to-heavy REEs essential for advanced military and clean energy technologies.

Supported by a $22.4 million U.S. Department of War agreement, Ucore claims its next-generation RapidSX™ technology offers significant performance and environmental advantages over traditional solvent extraction. With modularity, reconfigurability, and a smaller environmental footprint, Ucore is positioning RapidSX™ as the scalable, North American alternative to Chinese-dominated separation technology.

The big question now: Can Ucore’s Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex (SMC) meet its 2026 commercial startup goals—and meaningfully contribute to reshoring America’s rare earth supply chain?

Construction and permitting for the Louisiana SMC are underway. Long-lead equipment is being procured, and Ucore has launched feedstock acquisition and trial integration between its Canadian demonstration site and the upcoming U.S. facility. Initial outputs will target both mid and heavy rare earth oxides, with potential to scale further into NdPr.

But challenges remain. The company must prove RapidSX™’s performance at industrial scale, secure sufficient feedstock supply, and demonstrate its ability to compete economically—while defending its IP and raising capital in a volatile critical minerals market.

If successful, Ucore could represent a breakthrough in North American HREE refining independence—a field long dominated by Chinese processors. Yet success hinges not just on technology, but on execution, partnerships, and sustained demand.

As 2026 approaches, Rare Earth Exchanges will be watching closely. Ucore has momentum, but can it move from demo to deployment fast enough to meet geopolitical urgency—and investor expectations?

The Company

As of Q3 2025, Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (OTCQX: UURAF) has a market capitalization of approximately $506 million, reflecting a dramatic surge in valuation over the past year (up 750%). Despite this, the company remains in pre-revenue stage with no reported sales or gross profit, and posted a net loss of $33.3 million over the trailing twelve months, translating to an EPS of -$0.32. Ucore’s RapidSX™ commercialization push and rare earth strategy are being supported by $19.3 million in cash, but offset by $25.9 million in debt, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 54.3%. The company’s book value per share sits at just $0.36, while it trades at a price-to-book ratio of nearly 15, reflecting investor optimism about future growth rather than current fundamentals. Operational cash flow remains negative (-$8.7 million TTM), with free cash flow at -$6.4 million. With a current ratio of 1.24, Ucore has modest short-term liquidity, but long-term execution—including scaling U.S.-based HREE refining and securing commercial revenue—is essential to justify its elevated valuation.

Ucore Rare Metals' top shareholders include insiders like Randy Johnson (a significant holder and Director) and CEO Patrick Ryan, alongside entities such as Orca Holdings, LLC, which holds a large stake; institutional investors are fewer but present, with ORG Partners LLC being a notable fund. As of late 2025, Orca Holdings, LLC (through related parties like Randy Johnson) holds a significant portion, with management and directors also having substantial insider ownership.",https://rareearthexchanges.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=8196&type=rare-earth-exchanges&hash=17ba0f41ccc23391c2824cd370af5649,N,,2025-12-11 17:02:54.542948

Andy Beshear said Ford is expected to give more details about the future of the Kentucky plant early next week.
He also expressed optimism about Ford retaining ownership, noting its long history in Kentucky, including the $2 billion investment in its Louisville truck plant announced this past summer.

Ford announced Thursday morning that it is ending its joint venture with South Korean company SK On to build EV batteries at their two plants in Kentucky and Tennessee.

The companies announced that Ford would take sole ownership of the two buildings at the BlueOvalSK Battery Park in Glendale, while SK On will take ownership of the plant in Tennessee.

In his Thursday press conference, Gov. Andy Beshear said Ford is expected to give more details about the future of the Kentucky plant early next week. He also expressed optimism about Ford retaining ownership, noting its long history in Kentucky, including the $2 billion investment in its Louisville truck plant announced this past summer.

“I am confident that there will be activity in at least Kentucky 1 in our future,” Beshear said, referring to one of the plant’s two buildings. “What that activity will be, whether it will take longer to ramp up, that we've all got to work through.”

The EV battery plant project was announced in 2021, with the first batteries rolling on the assembly line in one building this summer. Production and hiring at the second building was delayed last year due to softer than anticipated demand for electric vehicles.

Another large setback for the EV industry came this summer with the passage of the “Big Beautiful Bill” by Congress, which ended the $7,500 tax credits for people buying electric vehicles and made changes to a manufacturing credit program that denied tax credits to projects owned by foreign entities.

Beshear addressed that bill Thursday, calling out President Donald Trump and Republican Congressman Brett Guthrie, whose district includes Glendale.

“I'm still amazed that the President would push through such a job-killing bill that cut subsidies and grants that companies and people had relied upon,” Beshear said. “And it's really disappointing that Brett Guthrie, who has three EV plants in his district, would be the one that champions it, pushes it through and doesn't make any changes at all to protect those plants.”

“So if we have people that lose their jobs, or jobs that are not created, your own congressman did it to you, and that's really, really wrong. Your governor is going to do his best. I'm going to do my best to make sure we have as many jobs at those facilities as possible.”

A spokesperson for Rep. Guthrie did not immediately return an email seeking comment on the Ford news and Beshear’s remarks.

The separation of Ford and SK On is expected to be finalized at the end of first quarter in 2026, pending federal approval.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/95323ef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6f%2F2d%2Ffdd844e94ebfaef573cbe3a491c3%2Fimg-7607.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 17:01:48.756522

At issue: whether Michigan met all the pollution control requirements mandated by the Clean Air Act before the EPA could approve the redesignation.
“Excusing non-compliance with the statute’s deadlines would render toothless the requirement that a state continue complying with the [Clean Air Act] even if it already submitted a redesignation request,” Judge Helene White wrote in the opinion.
‘Clean Air Act deadlines are meant to have teeth’ The Sierra Club brought the challenge.
“They should see some additional commitments from EGLE to take regulatory action to lower ozone pollution, including facilities on the east side,” the attorney said of what residents can expect.","A federal appeals court has overturned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2023 decision that declared the Detroit area in compliance with national ozone air quality standards.

It’s a ruling that environmental advocates say could lead to stronger pollution controls in a region burdened by some of Michigan’s highest asthma rates.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled Dec. 5 that the EPA violated the Clean Air Act when it redesignated the seven-county Southeast Michigan area from “nonattainment” to “attainment” for the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards. The decision returns the region to nonattainment status.

At issue: whether Michigan met all the pollution control requirements mandated by the Clean Air Act before the EPA could approve the redesignation. The court found that the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy failed to adopt regulations requiring certain industrial facilities to implement “reasonably available control technology,” or RACT, for sources that emit volatile organic compounds, which are a key precursor to ground-level ozone.

“Excusing non-compliance with the statute’s deadlines would render toothless the requirement that a state continue complying with the [Clean Air Act] even if it already submitted a redesignation request,” Judge Helene White wrote in the opinion.

‘Clean Air Act deadlines are meant to have teeth’

The Sierra Club brought the challenge. Elena Saxonhouse is a senior attorney for the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program.

“It was good to see the Court acknowledging that Clean Air Act deadlines are meant to have teeth and that an EPA interpretation that undermines an explicit deadline cannot stand,” Saxonhouse told Planet Detroit.

“The upshot is that Michigan will need to complete additional Clean Air Act requirements for the area, including issuing rules limiting pollution from certain sources of the type of pollution that leads to ozone.”

Those pollutants include nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs.

The ruling means EGLE must now operate under nonattainment requirements and must adopt RACT rules before pursuing another redesignation request — a process Nick Leonard, a Great Lakes Environmental Law Center attorney who argued the case, estimated could take one to two years.

The ruling vindicates concerns advocates raised during the original redesignation process, he said.

“They should see some additional commitments from EGLE to take regulatory action to lower ozone pollution, including facilities on the east side,” the attorney said of what residents can expect. “I would hope sometime in the next several months to a year.”

Saxonhouse said EGLE issued RACT rules for VOC sources several years earlier, then suspended enforcement of those rules for the Detroit area the same day the nonattainment designation was lifted.

“You can see they cover a variety of sources, like auto-painting operations, asphalt mixers, certain processes at refineries,” she said.

EGLE did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

How wildfire smoke plays into ozone decisions

The East 7 Mile air quality monitor on Detroit’s east side has recorded ozone levels above the federal health-based standard of 70 parts per billion for the last decade. The monitor sits in a community with asthma hospitalization rates among the highest in Michigan.

The court upheld the EPA’s decision to exclude air quality data for June 24 and 25, 2022, attributing those ozone spikes to Canadian wildfire smoke rather than local pollution.

Environmental advocates challenged that determination as well, arguing it set a troubling precedent for future exceptional events claims. The exclusion paved the way for the attainment designation.

Saxonhouse said the wildfire smoke decision may not be a predictor of future decisions to exclude wildfire smoke data.

“We pointed to a lot of information in the record that directly contradicted the finding that it was wildfire smoke that caused high ozone readings on those two days,” she said. “It is unfortunate the court discounted that. However, the court’s decision on this was very fact-specific, so it doesn’t necessarily signal that shoddy analysis will be upheld in the future.”

As Planet Detroit reported in October, EGLE is seeking EPA approval to exclude four additional days of ozone data from 2023, also citing wildfire smoke. That request remains pending.

“We expect to get in touch with EPA and EGLE directly to discuss next steps, but I would hope to see EPA revising its internal and public information to reflect that this area is back in nonattainment, and clarifying an appropriate deadline for attainment,” Saxonhouse said.

“As for Michigan, it remains to be seen whether they will take this as a signal to take serious action to reduce ozone levels in the area, or keep trying to avoid taking regulatory action.”

An EPA spokesperson said the agency “is reviewing the decision” and did not respond to questions about whether it plans to appeal.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-980595898.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 17:02:16.659498

Halifax, Nova Scotia--(Newsfile Corp. - December 11, 2025) - Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSXV: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) (""Ucore"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to update on its RapidSX™ rare earth element (""REE"") separation technology commercialization progress and its USD$22.4 million U.S. Department of War (""DoW"") Other Transaction Agreement (""OTA"" or the ""Project"") through the U.S. Army Contracting Command-Orlando (""ACC-ORL"").

Since the December 2023 start of the demonstration program, Ucore has operated and continuously improved its 52-Stage RapidSX™ Demonstration Plant (""Demo Plant"") within the Company's Kingston, Ontario, Commercialization and Demonstration Facility (""CDF""). This work is dedicated to transitioning the Company's RapidSX™ separation technology to its under-construction Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex (""SMC"") in Alexandria, Louisiana. The Louisiana SMC is a developing REE separation and oxide production facility focused on the production of mid (SmEuGd) and heavy (initially Tb and Dy, potentially followed by Y, which is in high demand) rare earth elements with the ability to also produce an NdPr rare earth oxide (""REO"") product.

The CDF work has focused on the precise manipulation of tonnes of a heavy mixed rare-earth oxide derived from a US-friendly feedstock resource through the series of RapidSX™ splits shown in Figure 1.

These splits represent the initial planned REO groups and products for the Louisiana SMC, and in every case have been directly compared to a 52-Stage Conventional Solvent Extractant (""CSX"") pilot circuit at the CDF for direct purity and recovery comparisons.

Ucore's advancements and achievements on the Project that lead to Louisiana include:

Completion of about 5,700 hours of REE processing with tonnes of heavy mixed rare earth oxides (""MREO"") in an automated and simulated 24-hour per day commercial production environment

Production of LaCe, NdPr, SmEuGd, Sm, Gd, HoYErTmYbLu, TbDy, Tb, and Dy rare earth element groups and products, while:

Demonstrating the use of one RapidSX™ Machine (i.e., the Demo Plant) for all splits and multiple feed stocks

Instituting a continuous improvement program for the RapidSX™Technology Platform in preparation for copy and paste transfer to the Louisiana SMC

Developing the ability to quickly (i.e., within hours) reconfigure the RapidSX™ unit operational equipment (e.g., extract, scrub, strip, etc., components) for specific separation requirements

Honing the ability to stop (i.e., for minutes, hours, days, or weeks) and immediately restart for planned and unplanned events

Establishing protocols for replicating precise and robust manipulation of the standard solvent extraction chemistry within the RapidSX™ technology platform

Construction of a dedicated production environment ICPMS laboratory with seven days per week support (to support 24/7 operations)

The Commerce Department and Pentagon in November pledged financing and potential equity stakes in a domestic producer of rare-earth magnets that are at the center of a trade war with China, the world’s dominant supplier.

Commerce signed a non-binding, preliminary letter of intent to provide $50 million from the 2022 CHIPS Act to Vulcan Elements to purchase equipment needed to produce so-called permanent magnets used in fighter jets, wind turbines, and a range of other critical goods, according to a statement from the department.

Vulcan Elements separately said it’s receiving a $620 million direct loan from the Pentagon’s Office of Strategic Capital and $550 million in private capital to build a 10,000-metric-ton magnet facility in the US. Its partner, rare earth firm ReElement Technologies Corp., gets an $80 million direct loan from the Pentagon office to expand its recycling and processing capabilities, with that amount matched by private capital.

“It’s a dream come true,” Vulcan Elements Chief Executive John Maslin said in an interview. “This is all about ramping up the existing production that we have and getting to a scale that is meaningful to the country.”

The announcements are the latest in a string of actions taken by the federal government to invest directly in the supply chain of permanent magnet production, an industry dominated by China. It’s also further indication of the Trump administration’s dedication to create a rare-earth and magnet market that operates outside of China’s influence — a risky bet but one that could wean the US and its allies off dependence on the world’s second-largest economy.

To be sure, it’s unclear how all of the parts of the arrangement will play out as the CHIPS Act funds are part of a non-binding agreement.

The Pentagon confirmed the details of the arrangement in a statement to Bloomberg, adding that funding for the conditional loans came from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July, which provides $100 billion in lending authority for critical minerals production and related industries and projects.

“These agreements will support the production of advanced rare earth element separation, metallization, and magnet manufacturing capabilities in the U.S.,” the statement said.

ReElement separates and refines rare earths from mined concentrate and waste or recycled materials, producing oxides that are used to make metal for magnets. In an interview in September, Shane Tragethon, the company’s vice president for international strategy, said it’s the only operation in the US that separates heavy rare earths — the type targeted by China’s export controls — on a daily basis.

Earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick converted CHIPS act funds to equity in struggling US chipmaker Intel Corp. The potential for a similar stake in Vulcan, which supplies magnets in the US for defense and commercial products, shows the muscle Lutnick is willing to flex to make a mark on the semiconductor industry while attempting to shore up a return for the US government.

“Our investment in Vulcan Elements will accelerate US production of rare-earth magnets for American manufacturers,” Lutnick said in a statement provided by North Carolina-based Vulcan Elements. “We are laser-focused on bringing critical mineral and rare earth manufacturing back home.”

The partnership includes the Pentagon receiving warrants in both Vulcan Elements and ReElement, though the value of those warrants hasn’t been identified. The warrants grant it the right to eventually buy shares in the closely held companies.

Agroforestry and Agroecology The jury is in regarding agroforestry.
From agroecology, agroforestry can take co-design and Participatory Action Research (PAR) and bake them in as defaults, building trials around farmer-led experimentation and treating farmers as collaborators, not adopters.
From agroforestry, agroecology can draw more strategically on large data sets on carbon, hydrology, soils and landscape tools (remote sensing, GIS, biodiversity indicators, land-equivalent ratios) that make systems-level impacts legible to policy and finance without surrendering transformative social aims.
As I move forward, I hope to see this project keep building that connective tissue agroecology and agroforestry have been missing.","As the temperature in Burlington, Vt. plummets to near zero (don’t even ask me about the “feels like” temperature, spoiler alert: it feels COLD), I’ve been reflecting on warmer days. In mid-October, I traveled to Kigali, Rwanda as a delegate to the 6th World Congress on Agroforestry, representing the Institute for Agroecology (IfA) and Food Systems at UVM. I was there to share my PhD research on community food forests and learn from the 700-plus delegates from 63 countries, working across research, practice, policy, and civil society.

As I shared my research, listened to other presentations, and went on site visits, I was buoyed by the extensive work taking place in agroforestry across the globe. But, at the same time, I was grappling with the gaps - especially around participatory and community co-designed processes. There is a lot of good work happening, and we still have much to do.

About the World Congress on Agroforestry

The World Congress on Agroforestry (WCA) started in 2004 in Orlando, Fl., with the aspiration of creating a global forum for science, policy, and practice to move forward global agroforestry transitions. The WCA is now the place where the field of agroforestry periodically “re-anchors” itself, addresses new debates, tensions, and questions, and reflects on what has and hasn’t worked in practice. Convened by the International Union for Agroforestry (IUAF) with rotating host country’s Ministries of Environment, the WCA has strong participation from Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO), and other international partners.

This year’s WCA in Kigali was the sixth (following Nairobi, Delhi, Montpellier, and Québec City). Under the theme of “agroforestry for people, planet and profit,” Kigali built on the 5th Congress in Québec (2022), which called on agroforestry to support the “transition to a viable world.” The 6th Congress advanced this vision by examining the interconnected ecological, social, and economic challenges of scaling agroforestry.

Why Rwanda?

Rwanda was an early and ambitious adopter of the Bonn Challenge- a global effort to restore 350 million hectares of the world’s degraded and deforested lands by 2030 using Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR). FLR is a planned process to regain, improve, and maintain a deforested or degraded landscape’s long term ecological functions and enhance human wellbeing (César et al., 2021). Rwanda made the highest proportional commitment of any country to date by committing to two million hectares, nearly 80% of its total land area, by 2030 (Mukuralinda et al., 2016). As of 2021, Rwanda had reached 40% of its commitment, restoring 800,000 hectares of land, with investments to date estimated at $560 million (US), according to the Bonn Challenge Barometer (IUCN | Restoration Barometer Report 2022.).

On the ground, Rwanda’s restoration work is being undertaken through afforestation, sustainable management of existing forests, and, importantly, through agroforestry which accounts for the major share of the effort at 1.1 million hectares. To address the challenges and barriers associated with implementation of agroforestry at such a large scale, the government adopted a National Agroforestry Strategy and Action Plan (2018–2027) and established an Agroforestry Task Force composed of government partners, NGOs, civil society, and CBOs to operationalize it (Iiyama et al., 2018) .

Some participants of the WCA were taken on a field visit into the highlands of the Gicumbi District in Rwanda’s Northern Province where the Green Gicumbi project has planted nearly 25,000 acres of agroforestry trees in cropped areas and restored 4,000+ acres of degraded forest. This is in addition to building 100 climate-resilient housing units constructed for farming families relocated from high-risk areas.

Along the drive, state-funded nurseries, terraced hillsides, riparian buffers, and mixed tree-crop systems were prominent, making it obvious why Rwanda’s Ministry of Environment wanted people to see this up close. While the work of scaling agroforestry is certainly not without its challenges, the country’s efforts demonstrate a living example where restoration targets, national policy and incentives, and farming practices are beginning to move towards alignment, even as familiar questions remain about power and participation

What 1.1M hectares of agroforestry means for farms and farmers:

Scaling agroforestry to 1.1M hectares (roughly 2.5 million acres) is a significant climate milestone with its benefits extending well beyond carbon sequestration to farm level agroecosystems and the farming communities that tend them. Integrated, diversified tree-crop-livestock systems tend to raise whole farm productivity. Deep-rooted perennials ‘pump’ nutrients from deeper depths and return them to the topsoil via litter and shallow root turnover so annuals can make use of the nutrients. Trees protect soil and water by reducing raindrop impact and runoff, reducing erosion and keeping nutrients in the ground. Mycorrhizae on tree roots, fueled by root exudates (tiny compounds that roots release), help mobilize phosphorus and micronutrients and build stable soil structure, making nutrients and water easier for plants to use. And the belle of the ball, leguminous perennials, add biologically fixed nitrogen, reducing the need for off-farm fertilizer inputs.

Crucially, for farmers, fruit, nuts, timber, forages, resins, and medicines that come from agroforestry systems provide important economic value and strengthen livelihoods. At the landscape scale, multistrata canopies, hedgerows, and understories link farm fields to the surrounding habitat. That connectivity stabilizes ecosystem functions (pollinators, natural enemies, soil biota, and wildlife movement) beyond a single field and can open doors to conservation cost-share programs, certifications, premiums or payments for ecosystem services.

Agroforestry and Agroecology

The jury is in regarding agroforestry. The benefits are well researched and clear. So what gives? In practice, agroforestry’s ability to support farmers hinges on things like secure tenure, accessible credit, reliable markets, supportive policies, and financial assistance. Put simply, agroforestry’s power to drive social transformation must answer the questions - who participates, who benefits, whose knowledge counts, and how are support systems structured? Questions that also ground the work of agroecology.

Agroforestry and agroecology are essentially first cousins. They share the same core premise: the closer an agroecosystem resembles a diverse, functioning ecosystem, the more resilient and productive it can be. Neither is new; both find their center of gravity in Indigenous and place-based land stewardship that has long worked within (and even enhanced) local ecologies. But, they grew up in different institutional homes: agroforestry largely within forestry and agronomy, tied to restoration, climate programs, and biophysical accounting; agroecology within agronomy, ecology, and social movements like food sovereignty and peasant rights, embodying a more explicitly transformative framework. Funding architectures sharpen the divide even further. Climate and restoration finance associated with agroforestry tend to reward what is easily measured at scale (carbon, canopy, hectares), while agroecology’s strengths - co-creation of knowledge, food sovereignty, cultural continuity- are harder to quantify but are equally, if not more, important to realizing transformation on the scale that is required.

How can these agroforest and agroecology move forward together? By borrowing the best from each. From agroecology, agroforestry can take co-design and Participatory Action Research (PAR) and bake them in as defaults, building trials around farmer-led experimentation and treating farmers as collaborators, not adopters. It can also bring a governance and justice lens by explicitly addressing and planning for land tenure, labor, credit, and biocultural goals. Importantly, it should also explicitly resource the social ecosystems of agriculture, like farmer-to-farmer exchanges and shared infrastructure like nurseries, so that knowledge and material resources move together. From agroforestry, agroecology can draw more strategically on large data sets on carbon, hydrology, soils and landscape tools (remote sensing, GIS, biodiversity indicators, land-equivalent ratios) that make systems-level impacts legible to policy and finance without surrendering transformative social aims.

In this sense, agroecology sets the compass- the why, for whom, and how- while agroforestry draws the map- the where and what of tree-based designs (alley cropping, food forests, windbreaks, riparian buffers, silvopasture) that can deliver those principles from small farms to entire landscapes. Both are needed for whole-systems level transitions.

Bringing It All Home

All these thoughts were top of mind throughout my time at the 6th WCA because they are the very same tensions I’m working through in my dissertation. The paper I presented focuses on a Participatory Action Research project to support the establishment of a community food forest in Grafton, Mass. My research within this project asks two core questions:

What role can participatory action research play in aligning institutional support for agroforestry with community-defined priorities?

How can community-based approaches to agroforestry (food forests as focal case) serve as entry points for farmer adoption, peer to peer learning, and public education?

I arrived at these questions because promotion and technical assistance efforts too often emphasize a narrow set of species and “technology packages,” thin market pathways, and insufficient attention to farmer knowledge, lived constraints, or broader agroecological dynamics. I work with primarily black, indigenous, and farmers of color who face adoption barriers like land access, tailored technical assistance, and patient capital that is rooted in, and amplified by, historic and ongoing inequities.

The early findings I shared at the WCA demonstrate how structural barriers outweigh technical ones, cultural continuity and intergenerational care act as core motivations for engaging in agroforestry in the Northeast, and the role of demonstration sites/living labs and community governance accelerate adoption.

So far, the site boasts 100+ fruit trees and 250+ shrubs and berries planted by Matt Feinstein and Ulum Pixan of the Global Village farming cooperative, community volunteers, and many by me and my special helper, Micah, who affectionately calls it his “fruit forest.” Through our collaborative efforts, we hope to show how community food forests can enable farmer-to-farmer exchange on practical questions (varieties, spacing, yield expectations, labor, market fit, and establishment costs) while also providing public education through open workshops, signage, and youth curricula. The hope is that the site will reduce perceived and real risk, build the material conditions needed for adoption, and generate locally grounded evidence. Equally important, the project is grounded in an equity-centered design that aims to reconnect BIPOC farmers and land stewards with regional plants and ecologies- relationships disrupted by colonialism and industrial food systems- while integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge with agroforestry science and practice. As I move forward, I hope to see this project keep building that connective tissue agroecology and agroforestry have been missing.

Funding acknowledgment: This work would not be possible without the support from UVM’s Sustainable Campus Fund, Northeast SARE (USDA-NIFA), and UVM’s Institute for Agroecology, with additional funding support and collaboration from the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, Pocasset Pokanoket Land Trust, and Global Village at Tuckaway Farms.

Ford and SK On formed BlueOval SK in 2021 to build three battery plants: two in Kentucky and one at Ford’s 6-square-mile manufacturing site in rural West Tennessee. The plants represent a combined $11.4 billion investment.

Under the mutual restructuring agreement announced Thursday, a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the Kentucky battery plants, and SK On will own and operate the battery plant in Tennessee, according to a statement from SK On. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be complete by the first quarter of 2026.

The agreement allows SK On to “improve its operational efficiency” and “respond more effectively to evolving market dynamics and diverse customer needs,” the company stated.

The start of production at the Tennessee battery plant “remains flexible at this time, as it’s tied to the ownership transition,” an SK On spokesperson said Thursday.

BlueOval SK External Affairs Director Keli McAlister wrote in a statement that the company is aware of SK On’s announcement and BlueOval SK is “working with both of our parent companies to determine what this means for BlueOval SK.”

A representative for Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

State officials are keeping a close eye on the arrangement because of a nearly $1 billion investment in BlueOval City.

“We are aware of Ford and SK On’s decision to end their U.S. battery joint venture; however, this corporate decision does not change or diminish the commitments made to West Tennessee,” the state’s Department of Economic and Community Development wrote in a statement. “The jobs, investment and long-term, generational impact promised to the region remain on track.”

Ford has pushed back its start date for mass production at the BlueOval City campus twice over the last two years amid a shifting electric vehicle market.

The industry has faced heightened political turbulence as President Donald Trump’s administration targeted Biden-era electric vehicle funding and tax credits.

As of August, Ford plans to start mass production of its next-generation electric pickup truck in 2028, three years after its initial production goal of 2025.

SK On “plans to focus on profitable and sustainable growth in the U.S. by supplying electric vehicle batteries to Ford and various customers, as well as energy storage systems, from its Tennessee plant,” the company stated.

It emphasized its ongoing commitment to the Tennessee plant, stating the facility is a “cornerstone of its expanding U.S. advanced battery manufacturing capabilities and production.”

SK On will “maintain its solid strategic relationship with Ford going forward,” as the Tennessee battery plant is located on the Ford campus.

When the BlueOval City project was announced in 2021, it received nearly $1 billion in state economic incentives contingent on creating 5,760 direct new jobs over a 10-year period, with Ford’s vehicle manufacturing plant slated to employ 3,000 of those workers. The remainder would be employed by the BlueOval SK battery plant.

BlueOval SK reported in September that it had hired 350 employees in Tennessee and 1,450 at its battery plants in Kentucky.

Ford announced a $2 billion investment in August to convert a Kentucky manufacturing plant to build electric vehicles, starting with a mid-sized electric pickup truck slated to launch in 2027.

In April 2024, the EPA finalized a rule requiring significant reductions in so-called “criteria pollutants” emitted from passenger and commercial vehicles from the 2027 through 2032 model years. As part of a planned delay, the EPA is considering keeping the 2026 standard in place for two additional years to give the agency time to reconsider the Biden-era standards and how the agency sets standards, the official added.

The EPA has separately proposed revoking the scientific finding that justified setting greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles and engines.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Ford, Stellantis, Hyundai and others, in September told EPA the criteria pollutant rule is “unachievable without significant increases in EV market share, while at the same time adding hundreds of dollars of additional costs to all internal combustion engine vehicles. Several changes should be made to these regulations to produce a more appropriate, cost-effective criteria emission standard.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in March announced the plan to reconsider the agency’s 2024 rules that would cut passenger vehicle fleetwide tailpipe emissions by nearly 50% by 2032 compared with 2027 projected levels. The EPA previously forecast that between 35% and 56% of new vehicles sold between 2030 and 2032 would need to be electric in order to comply.

Zeldin told reporters this week automakers told the agency the EPA requirements “were causing adverse impacts… By heeding those concerns, it’s going to have a positive impact on the auto industry, on auto jobs and bringing down the cost of vehicles and increasing consumer choice.”

The Biden rules require a 50% reduction in criteria pollutants like nitrogen oxides through 2032 for light vehicles and 58% cut for medium-duty vehicles. EPA last year estimated $13 billion in annualized benefits due to reduced emissions of criteria pollutants that contribute to the formation of soot and smog.

The EPA is reviewing if automakers should be able to continue to use electric vehicles to meet the standards and whether the agency should continue to allow credit banking and trading. Last week, the Transportation Department proposed ending credit trading as part of a significant rollback of fuel economy standards through 2031.

CES worked as a sub-contractor with contractor Ample Power, a long term partner of CES, to install SunPower P7 modules and SMA 125kW inverters.

Due to the activity at the DAF dealership, including HGV brake testing and welding, the site has what CES director Joe Collison described as “incredibly high energy demand”. The obstructed rooftop at the site, which also features skylight windows, presented an obstacle for the installation.

The solar generation will also power a 180kW DC charger at the site, where the company plans to install more charging capacity as well.

Collison added that these things “would have” affected the array sizes, but CES and Ample collaborated at the design stage to adjust planned locations for those windows and “where possible” Ample Power rerouted external pipework and vents.

The company has provided solar solutions for Dutch truck manufacturing company DAF before, installing a 121kWp solar PV array at a dealership in Bridgewater, Somerset. As a result of that project, DAF set new specifications for its dealerships to integrate renewable energy into its commercial transport facilities.

DAF dealerships are run as franchises, the Leicester one franchised by Ford & Slater, and in Bridgewater by Adams Morey.

Collison noted that the PV “is part of a wider scheme” that sees the Ford & Slater site already having commissioned CES to design and build an energy storage system (ESS) to store excess generation from the rooftop array.

Other vehicle manufacturers have turned to solar PV as a cost-effective energy source or to decarbonise their operations.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina’s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.

The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.

The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.

Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper’s costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.

Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.

The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site about 20 miles (32 kilometers) up the Broad River from Columbia.

Four executives ended up in prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.

If the $2.7 billion payment goes through, most of Santee Cooper’s debt from the nuclear debacle would be erased, utility CEO Jimmy Staton said at Monday’s board meeting where the proposal was unanimously approved.

“Our customers have been paying for these assets since 2017. It’s time they get some value out of that,” Staton said.

Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.

President Donald Trump’s administration wants the U.S. to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years.

But watchdog groups said there are too many hurdles to put this project in the win column right now.

After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.

Also, the type of reactors proposed have seen massive cost overruns even when successfully built. Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building them.

But some blue states also adopted sizable cuts, with New York reducing agency funding over the same time period by 25 percent, while Connecticut reduced it by 51 percent.
If both federal and state lines of defense fail, Duggan said, communities will face greater risk of exposure to dangerous pollution.
“This uneven trend underscores that any effort to further weaken the federal EPA will have disproportionate impacts across the country,” Duggan said.","States that have slashed funding for environmental regulation over the last 15 years have put themselves in a tough position to handle the fallout of the Trump administration’s pro-polluter agenda, according to a new report from the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP).

Since 2010, 27 states have slashed budgets and 31 have cut staff at their own public health and environmental agencies that partner with the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), increasing the risk of industrial accidents and potentially exposing already vulnerable communities to levels of pollution not seen in decades, the report found.

A handful of forward-looking states, including California, Vermont, and Colorado, are going in the opposite direction by investing in public health and climate initiatives, while other states saw budgets grow with Biden-era infrastructure and clean energy funding that is expected to dry up under President Trump.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and other Republicans have argued that state governments are better positioned to enforce clean air and water laws, a line the GOP has pushed for years while conservative lawmakers continuously slashed funding for environmental enforcement at the state level.

But EIP executive director Jen Duggan said that the Trump administration’s alarming proposal to cut the EPA’s budget by 55 percent, alongside efforts to systematically roll back clean air and water protections for the benefit of the fossil fuel industry and other polluters, has further weakened the regulatory capacity of states.

“The Trump administration is attempting to dismantle the EPA and roll back commonsense federal pollution rules, claiming that the states can pick up the slack and protect our communities — but that’s not the case,” Duggan told reporters on Wednesday. “Our research found that many states have already cut their pollution control agencies, and so more cuts at the federal level will only put more Americans at risk.”

Less funding and staff at state environmental agencies means fewer inspections of industrial facilities to prevent accidents, more air and water pollution released under outdated permits, and a slower response to chemical accidents, oil spills, and complaints from residents about foul orders or dirty drinking water, according to Duggan.

“When agencies have fewer resources to do their job, that means there are less inspectors that are able to do routine inspections or respond to community complaints, and it may take longer from the time a violation is identified to resolve that violation,” Duggan said. “It really means there are less people on the ground to make sure companies are following the law.”

Consider North Carolina, where an explosion in industrial meat production across the state, combined with intensifying storms and flooding, has contaminated streams and groundwater with animal waste that can contain dangerous pathogens and chemicals — not to mention the foul air pollution emitted by factory farms. North Carolina’s population has also grown alongside industrial development in recent years, but state leaders made some of the deepest cuts to environmental and public health oversight in the United States.

From 2010 to 2024, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) suffered the largest staffing cuts by percentage of any state environmental agency in the nation, losing nearly a third of its staff or about 386 jobs, according to the report. State lawmakers and governors from both parties voted to slash the agency’s budget by 32 percent over the same time period.

Drew Ball, the southeast campaigns director for Natural Resources Defense Council in Asheville, North Carolina, said the DEQ saw some improvement under former Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat whose term ended earlier this year. However, after facing years of attacks from Republicans, the state agency no longer has the capacity to keep up with the rapid growth of factory farms.

“DEQ has still been forced to operate with one hand behind their back, because lawmakers in Raleigh have treated environmental and public health protections as political targets … by weakening water pollution standards, and restricting people’s ability to hold industrial farms accountable when they are harmed,” Ball told reporters on Wednesday.

Ball said the cuts to North Carolina’s environmental office came as the number of factory farms known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) grew rapidly in the eastern end of the state, where 8 million hogs and 1 billion chickens have been living in cramped conditions since March 2025. The huge amounts of manure produced by CAFOs can leach pollution into streams and groundwater and is often stored in massive lagoons, some of which have ruptured or overflowed during hurricanes.

Ball said North Carolinians worry about what the next storm will wash into their yards.

“And now the federal government is making the deepest cuts to EPA in 40 years … it’s like dismantling the fire department when the fire is already burning,” Ball said.

With the EPA facing massive cuts under Trump, Duggan said that states will also have fewer if any federal regulators on the ground to respond to localized accidents, spills, pollution violations, and cleanups. If both federal and state lines of defense fail, Duggan said, communities will face greater risk of exposure to dangerous pollution.

“This uneven trend underscores that any effort to further weaken the federal EPA will have disproportionate impacts across the country,” Duggan said. “Communities could face an increase in pollution risks, while other states are better protected by a robust secondary defense for public health.”

After passing a short-term funding bill in November to reopen the government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history, Congress is expected to vote on funding for the EPA and other federal agencies in January.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2224533087-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 16:05:24.694995

An Energy Department spokesman said the loan, finalized in the waning days of the previous administration for the construction of plants in Tennessee and Kentucky, would be restructured to “reduce exposure to taxpayers and ensure its prompt repayment.”

The loan will be reduced in size and Ford is working voluntarily with the department to repay more quickly, said a person familiar with the matter, who asked to not be identified because the details are private. Ford declined to comment.

The loan changes could set back an already troubled initiative by the second-largest US automaker and the South Korean company to build out the domestic supply chain for EV batteries — a key priority of former President Joe Biden. SK announced that its battery unit and Ford had agreed to independently own and operate their production facilities, rather than run them jointly.

The dissolution of the venture marks the latest twist in Ford’s years-long struggle to stem losses at its electric vehicle business amid a broader industry trend of slower-than-expected EV adoption. Ford lost $5.1 billion before interest and taxes on its EV business in 2024 and has said its deficit could be even wider this year.

The new study, done by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project, found the state slashed funding for the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality by 71% from 2010 to 2024. Mississippi also had the largest decrease in total dollars from that time, with MDEQ’s inflation-adjusted budget dropping from $373 million t0 $107 million, the report said.

The EIP report also looked at staffing reductions over that timeframe. Mississippi ranked 10th in staffing cuts, going from 523 employees in 2010 to 433 in 2024, or a 17% decrease.

In total, 27 states cut funding to their environmental agencies over that period, including Mississippi’s neighbors Alabama (a 49% decrease) and Louisiana (26%). But its other neighbors, Arkansas and Tennessee, both saw opposite trends, with increases of 31% and 30%, respectively. South Dakota saw the second highest budget decrease with 61%.

In an interview earlier this year, MDEQ Executive Director Chris Wells described the agency as being understaffed.

“(MDEQ employees) in certain areas of the agency are stretched pretty thin,” Wells told Mississippi Today in April. “They’re working more than 40 hours a week, barely keeping their head above water, and in a lot of cases not necessarily meeting expectations from the outside in terms of how fast we get permits turned around.”

He estimated MDEQ had lost around 50 employees since he took over the agency in 2020.

MDEQ’s role is to conserve the state’s public, natural resources and to regulate pollution into the air, water and soil. Any business in the state that has such releases must first obtain a permit from the agency. MDEQ’s other roles include overseeing the state’s sewer systems, monitoring aquifers and managing dozens of projects funded from the BP oil spill settlement.

The EIP argued recent cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency at the federal level will put more pressure on state agencies. The White House is looking to cut EPA’s budget by 55% next year, which would bring its funding to the lowest amount since the 1980s, Politico reported in May.

“The Trump Administration is attempting to dismantle EPA and roll back commonsense federal pollution rules, claiming that the states can pick up the slack and protect our communities – but that’s not the case,” Jen Duggan, EIP’s executive director, said. “The implementation of our environmental laws depend on both a strong EPA and state agencies that have the resources they need to do their jobs. But our research found that many states have already cut their pollution control agencies and so more cuts at the federal level will only put more Americans at risk.”

Legislative budget records show about a third of MDEQ’s funding comes from the federal government.

In response to Wednesday’s report, the agency said it couldn’t comment on the study, but added that funding from the state Legislature for MDEQ’s operational costs had increased nearly 14% since 2010.

Records available online show a slight uptick in funding from the Legislature since fiscal year 2011 when adjusted for inflation. But they also show a large drop-off during much of that period, as seen in the chart below.

Moreover, those funds, about $16 million a year, only make up a small portion of MDEQ’s total appropriations. Most of MDEQ’s funding comes from other sources, such as fees it collects and federal support. Overall, funding for the agency decreased by over a quarter between fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2025, the chart below shows.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47653/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06203318/mg_4367-scaled1765503780.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=vGJQvYLq,N,,2025-12-11 21:00:06.188525

According to the report, India’s solar manufacturing capacity has expanded significantly since 2022, with current operational capacity reaching 120GW for modules and 29.3GW for cells (as of June 2025).
Limited scale in domestic polysilicon production also undermines cost competitiveness, highlighting the structural challenges in achieving a self-reliant and globally competitive solar manufacturing ecosystem.
“Delays in implementing PLI solar PV facilities have also limited the scheme’s economic impact,” says Sharma.
The report underscores that PLI non-compliance can lead to substantial financial losses for solar PLI awardees.","9 December 2025 (JMK Research and IEEFA South Asia): A new report from JMK Research and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) notes that while the solar PLI scheme has helped lay the groundwork for domestic PV manufacturing, it continues to face significant operational and policy challenges.

“The scheme channels government support towards measurable industrial output, helping build durable, long-term manufacturing capacity,” says Vibhuti Garg, Director, IEEFA South Asia, and a contributing author of the report.

According to the report, India’s solar manufacturing capacity has expanded significantly since 2022, with current operational capacity reaching 120GW for modules and 29.3GW for cells (as of June 2025). Post-2022 capacity additions totalled 82GW in modules and 22.7GW in cells, representing a 216% and 344% increase, respectively, from 2022 levels.

Whatever limited polysilicon and wafer capacities exist in India have come solely through the PLI scheme — underscoring India’s continued upstream dependence on imports — while about 36% of total cell and 24% of module capacity originate from PLI allocations.

“However, the PLI scheme for solar PV manufacturing faces implementation challenges like high capital intensity of upstream integration, inadequate incentives, inconsistencies in trade policy, import dependency, and global raw material price volatility,” says Prabhakar Sharma, senior consultant, JMK Research, and one of the report’s authors.

Policy asymmetries — such as unrestricted imports for polysilicon and wafers alongside module restrictions under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) — and frequent ALMM revisions have created uncertainty for domestic manufacturers. Besides, the scheme’s emphasis on fully integrated wafer-to-module facilities requires steep upfront investments, while incentives cover only a small fraction of production costs.

“India’s reliance on imported machinery, components, and Chinese technical expertise has further slowed capacity ramp-up, a situation worsened by visa restrictions and limited equipment availability,” says Chirag H Tewani, senior research associate at JMK Research, and a co-author of the report.

Meanwhile, global price volatility — especially in polysilicon and wafers — and China’s dominance in upstream production expose Indian manufacturers to cost spikes and supply disruptions. Limited scale in domestic polysilicon production also undermines cost competitiveness, highlighting the structural challenges in achieving a self-reliant and globally competitive solar manufacturing ecosystem.

“Delays in implementing PLI solar PV facilities have also limited the scheme’s economic impact,” says Sharma. As of June 2025, only 31GW of the targeted 65GW module capacity was commissioned, attracting roughly Rs48,120 crore (~US$5.5 billion) in investments and creating 38,500 direct jobs — far below the targets of Rs94,000 crore (US$10.45 billion) and 1.95 lakh direct jobs, the report states.

The report underscores that PLI non-compliance can lead to substantial financial losses for solar PLI awardees. According to JMK Research, across both tranches, solar PLI awardees can incur a monetary risk of up to Rs41,834 crore (~US$4.80 billion) cumulatively, combining direct penalties (bank guarantees encashment), lost incentives, and unrealised revenue from sales.

The scheme’s trajectory hinges on comprehensive recalibration rather than timeline extensions alone. “Future PLI iterations should focus on improving cost competitiveness, upstream integration and market resilience,” says Aman Gupta, research associate, JMK Research, and an author of the report. Key measures include tax credits, low-cost financing, and risk buffers against global price volatility; layered incentives and longer policy horizons to encourage full value-chain participation; and support for critical components to foster an integrated domestic supply chain.

With the emerging 50% US tariff on Indian solar exports adding pressure, the policy environment is becoming increasingly complex and will require strategic adaptation. The report emphasises that India must develop institutional mechanisms for coordinated policy implementation, and better align incentives with manufacturing timelines and market protection measures, while providing long-term policy certainty.

While the long-term trajectory points toward rapid scaling, the immediate landscape is defined by a tension between ambitious decarbonization targets and the economic realities of bringing gigawatt-scale projects to final investment decision (FID).

A Market in Transition

The report identifies the primary engines of this growth: binding net-zero commitments, a surge in renewable energy capacity, and intensifying demand for clean mobility solutions.

According to the data, the market is entering a pivotal phase. While 2025 marks a valuation of roughly $2.8 billion, the anticipated leap to $74.81 billion suggests that the sector is expected to mature from pilot projects to industrial commoditization rapidly.

Dominant Technologies and Sources

Despite the buzz surrounding newer technologies, established methods remain the backbone of the industry.

Alkaline electrolysis is expected to dominate the market through 2032. Accounting for 61.2% of the market share by value in 2024, alkaline systems are favored for their lower capital expenditure (CAPEX) and avoidance of precious metals like platinum and iridium, which are required for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzers.

""Alkaline systems have been used in industrial hydrogen production for over two decades, yielding an excellent reliability record and a robust supply chain,"" the report notes. This maturity makes them the preferred choice for utility-scale projects where reliability and cost-efficiency are paramount.

On the energy supply side, wind energy has emerged as the leading renewable source, accounting for 48.9% of the market value in 2024. The high capacity factors of offshore wind—often exceeding 50%—allow for more continuous electrolyzer operation compared to solar, improving the economics of hydrogen production.

The Mobility vs. Industry Debate

One of the report’s most notable findings is the prominence of the mobility sector, which it identifies as the largest end-use segment with a 57.7% market share in 2024. The analysis points to heavy-duty transport, long-haul freight, and maritime applications as key drivers, where battery-electric solutions often fall short due to range and weight limitations.

However, this finding stands in contrast to recent data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). In its Global Hydrogen Review, the IEA noted that while mobility is a key growth area, the vast majority of current actual demand still stems from traditional industrial applications, such as oil refining and ammonia production. This discrepancy highlights the divide between the sector's current operational reality and the projected demand centers of the future.

North America’s Policy-Driven Boom

Geographically, North America is forecast to be the fastest-growing region, with a CAGR of 69.7%. This surge is heavily underpinned by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), specifically the Section 45V production tax credit, which offers up to $3.00 per kilogram for low-carbon hydrogen.

The region's growth has not been without complications. The industry spent much of 2024 awaiting final guidance from the U.S. Treasury on the ""three pillars"" of hydrogen production—additionality, temporal matching, and deliverability. With these rules now clarifying the path forward, developers are expected to move faster to capitalize on the $7-8 billion allocated for Regional Hydrogen Hubs.

Sector Recalibration

While the forecast is bullish, the broader industry context suggests a more complex road ahead.

The past 12 months have seen a ""reality check"" for green hydrogen, with major players like Shell, BP, and Orsted canceling or scaling back high-profile projects due to regulatory uncertainty and higher-than-expected renewable power costs.

Despite these headwinds, the consensus among analysts is that the sector is not stalling, but rather maturing. The focus has shifted from speculative announcements to projects with secured offtake agreements and viable economic models.

As the market pushes toward the 2032 horizon, the successful integration of large-scale wind farms with alkaline electrolysis, supported by clear policy frameworks in North America and Europe, will likely determine if the industry can meet its $75 billion potential.

Battery storage facilities and solar farms powered virtually all capacity growth in Texas’ electric grid throughout 2025, as the home of the nation’s oil and gas industry created almost twice as much new solar power as California.

More than 5,200 megawatts, or approximately 10,500 megawatt hours, of new battery storage made up the largest share of the more than 11,000 megawatts of new capacity, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), operator of Texas’ electric grid. Solar power accounted for the second-largest capacity addition, with more than 4,500 megawatts installed.

Pablo Vegas, ERCOT’s president and CEO, said during a board of directors meeting Tuesday that the new solar power represented “high” growth in intermittent power, while he characterized the new battery storage as “very rapid growth” of short-duration power supply.

“It’s a significant shift in operational requirements, and it represents an opportunity to create a more resilient and cost-effective grid,” Vegas said.

Wind power and natural gas trailed far behind solar and storage additions, adding more than 860 megawatts and 520 megawatts, respectively.

Vegas said the market continues to see low numbers of natural gas connections to the grid, despite the state’s $10 billion loan and grant fund to build more natural gas power plants. But he said there are “significant improvements” in interest among developers exploring natural gas connections to the grid.

Texas is leading the country in new solar capacity. The state added more than three gigawatts of solar power in the third quarter, making it the second-largest quarter for solar additions, according to a joint report by Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). The U.S. solar industry installed 11.7 gigawatts of capacity nationally during the third quarter, a 20 percent increase from the same period last year.

Over the first nine months of 2025, Texas installed 7.4 gigawatts of solar, almost double the capacity of California’s newest additions. This comes despite the Trump Administration’s efforts to roll back renewable energy development in the U.S.

“This record-setting quarter for solar deployment shows that the market is continuing to turn to solar to meet rising demand,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO.

The meaningful additions of solar and battery storage have positioned Texas’ grid to handle summer demand peaks well, with large amounts of solar generating electricity during the day and batteries helping the grid transition into the evening, Vegas said.

But winter continues to represent a higher risk period for ERCOT, Vegas said. Solar and storage capacity are limited during the most critical periods during winter, such as early in the morning before sunrise or in the evening just after sunset. But even then, the chance of rotating outages during the riskiest morning hours is around 1 percent, according to ERCOT reports.

That’s better than last year, when ERCOT predicted a 7 percent chance of rotating blackouts during last winter’s peak hours.

But ensuring the grid stays balanced during the winter months remains a concern, as ERCOT tries to innovate quickly to accommodate the growing variety of energy resources and to accommodate large energy users, like data centers and crypto mines, seeking to connect to the grid.

Vegas said both the state and ERCOT have worked hard since Winter Storm Uri, when blackouts across the state left many Texans without power or heating for days and at least 246 people died, to regain public trust that the state’s grid will hold up in Texas’ extreme weather.

ERCOT’s models show that if Texas experienced a winter storm like it did in February 2021 and demand exceeded record levels, the risk of rotating outages would increase 54 percent.

The forecast accounts for the state’s growth in recent years, projects that if Texas were to be hit by similar weather conditions to the 2021 storm, power demand would exceed 97 gigawatts. That’s far more than the current demand record of 85.5 gigawatts set during a scorching summer heat wave in 2023.

But the likelihood that demand will reach more than 97 gigawatts is less than one percent, according to the report.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-Untitled.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 18:01:11.275533

They say it’s an effort to reduce “wasteful spending” and give more environmental oversight back to states like Indiana.

A new report by the Environmental Integrity Project shows it’s unlikely states can shoulder more responsibility. More than half of states have cut funding for their environmental agencies since 2010 — both in red and blue states.

The Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s budget went down by 19 percent. That includes cuts to programs that respond to environmental emergencies, manage hazardous waste and control air pollution at major facilities.

EIP Executive Director Jen Duggan said critical state programs have already taken a hit.

“Continuing to weaken the federal EPA at the same time would leave significant gaps in public health protections and heightened pollution risks for communities across the country,"" she said.

Though IDEM’s staffing levels have rebounded since the pandemic, they’re still 16 percent lower than what they were 15 years ago.

The White House’s budget would also cut federal funding that supports state environmental programs — including projects for safe drinking water.

23 states increased funding for their environmental agencies since 2010. However, Duggan said even the most proactive states can't replace a strong EPA.

""The EPA establishes national pollution standards, provides critical program oversight, conducts its own enforcement efforts and leads essential scientific research. When states have the necessary authority, expertise and commitment — the EPA can delegate many responsibilities to them. But this shared system only works when both levels of government are adequately supported,"" she said.

Duggan also called on states to restore funding to their environmental programs to better protect residents.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d456bc3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x788+0+159/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F82%2Fbc2067454032bdc65e0ac4de2c7f%2Fidem1-0.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 16:05:29.488797

Public lands attacks were uniquely unpopular in 2025 This summer, mass opposition forced congressional Republicans to remove from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act language that would have required the sale of public lands.
Additionally, the Trump administration’s firings of park rangers and other public lands staff have prompted widespread and bipartisan concern.
Similar analysis found that 98 percent of public commenters oppose the proposed rescission of the Public Lands Rule, a cornerstone policy guiding land conservation and restoration across nearly 250 million acres of public lands.
Sadly, as we look ahead to 2026, the Trump administration shows no signs of changing course on public lands.","Notably, President Trump’s year-one agenda for public lands hewed remarkably close to the special-interest wish lists prepared by the oil and gas industry and industry-aligned Project 2025 before he took office. As CAP outlined in January, that checklist included offering massive oil and gas lease sales; weakening safeguards for drilling; targeting protections for the Boundary Waters, Chaco Canyon, and the Arctic; and erasing the Bureau of Land Management’s Public Lands Rule.

At the same time, President Trump and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) made deep and harmful cuts to public lands agencies. For example, about 24 percent of National Park Service employees were fired, resigned, or otherwise departed in just the first half of 2025, with further cuts already planned. The president’s proposed budget for 2026 would go even further, cutting public lands agency budgets by more than one-third from 2024 levels; robbing funds from the nation’s core conservation funding program, the popular and bipartisan Land and Water Conservation Fund; and even transferring some national park units out of federal ownership permanently. CAP estimates that Trump’s budget proposal would reduce per-visitor spending for public lands agencies by nearly 55 percent from 2011 levels—after accounting for inflation.

Public lands attacks were uniquely unpopular in 2025

This summer, mass opposition forced congressional Republicans to remove from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act language that would have required the sale of public lands. Pushed by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), a close Trump ally and chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, that portion of the bill would have sold off more than 2 million acres of public lands to help offset tax cuts. National polling shows deep opposition to selling public lands, and the Senate’s proposal met fierce opposition across the political spectrum.

Additionally, the Trump administration’s firings of park rangers and other public lands staff have prompted widespread and bipartisan concern. Faced with early backlash, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum backpedaled, reversing course on seasonal staffing cuts, rehiring some fired employees, and publicly promising to keep parks open as workforce concerns piled up. Similarly, the U.S. Forest Service backtracked on some of its firings in February and, after pressuring staff to leave the agency, subsequently asked resigned workers to return to help during the wildfire season.

Attempts to remove conservation protections for public lands have also met strong opposition. Of more than 600,000 public comments on the Trump administration’s proposal to rescind “roadless rule” protections for national forests, more than 99 percent were found to oppose the rollback of protections. Similar analysis found that 98 percent of public commenters oppose the proposed rescission of the Public Lands Rule, a cornerstone policy guiding land conservation and restoration across nearly 250 million acres of public lands.

Looking ahead: Was the shutdown a glimpse into the future?

Sadly, as we look ahead to 2026, the Trump administration shows no signs of changing course on public lands. Earlier this month, the administration nominated Steve Pearce—a former congressman with a track record of supporting public lands sell-offs and opposing national monuments, among other controversial positions—to lead the Bureau of Land Management. Meanwhile, despite public opposition, the Trump administration is plowing ahead with rollbacks, recently opening sensitive wildlife habitat in America’s Arctic to oil drilling.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/BadYearColumn-2201331607.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 18:00:21.709692

Developing nations gain industrial capacity and know-how while China secures a strong position in global supply chains and expands its influence.
If done correctly, these investments accelerate global net-zero goals and shift industrial power toward the Global South.","Since early 2023, Chinese companies have pledged more than $180 billion for clean energy projects outside China, according to a report by Climate Energy Finance. These firms produce most of the world’s solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles. They invest in full supply chains, from mining to recycling, helping other countries build green power systems.

China drives this change with large factories, low costs, and strategic planning. Leaders encourage firms to go global, focusing on places with big energy needs and signing agreements to share technology.

The result is a major shift in energy and trade flows. Developing nations in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East are becoming key hubs for green industries.

China Leads Global Clean-Tech Production

China dominates new clean energy plants. From 2018 to 2024, it controlled 80% of new solar, wind, battery, and hydrogen facilities worldwide, per the CEF report. Companies such as CATL and BYD set the pace, exporting billions in technology yearly.

Chinese investments cover complete supply chains. Mines, factories, battery plants, recycling centers, and renewable energy projects are all linked. By building such integrated systems, China ensures efficiency, scale, and long-term influence.

Trade agreements and political deals help China expand its reach. Firms get faster approvals, and pacts often include tech-sharing. These moves reshape how energy is produced, consumed, and traded globally.

In a separate report from SNE Research, China controls about 69% of the global electric-vehicle (EV) battery market in 2025. This dominance reflects the country’s strong control over battery supply chains, from material sourcing to manufacturing.

As a result, Chinese firms now significantly influence global battery prices, standards, and EV supply worldwide.

Targeting the Global South: Jobs, Tech, and Energy

Over 75% of China’s projects go to developing nations, and many align with the Belt and Road Initiative. The country selects locations with strict rules, clear policies, and high energy demands.

Chinese companies often form joint ventures with local partners. This approach shares jobs, skills, and technology. Governments support the investments with loans and incentives. Private companies lead the push, but state backing ensures that projects move quickly.

New investments reduce energy costs and create thousands of jobs. Countries see faster industrial growth and benefit from upgraded grids and green exports. China also adapts to local rules, meeting requirements for local labor, content, or training to secure contracts.

Southeast Asia: Batteries, EVs, and Solar Take Off

The world’s biggest emitter is making major moves in Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, CATL is building a $6 billion battery complex in West Java. The plant produces 6.9 GWh per year using nickel from local mines. Recycling units close the loop, and over 10,000 jobs will be created.

In Malaysia, EVE Energy invests $1.2 billion in energy storage, while BYD plans EV factories for cars and buses. GCL Technology also supports solar farms across the region. With these, trade with China is hitting new highs.

Thailand gets battery production from Sunwoda, a $1 billion plant with training centers. Moreover, Changan adds EV research sites, partnering with local firms. As seen in the chart below, the majority of the global battery manufacturers are Chinese firms.

China also uses tax breaks and fast permits to accelerate projects. Local content rules help create steady supply chains. These moves double trade with China and upgrade regional energy grids quickly.

Middle East Goes Green: Solar, Wind, and Hydrogen

China supports Middle Eastern countries in shifting away from fossil fuels. In Saudi Arabia, Shanghai Electric joins a $1.1 billion solar farm, powering 1.5 million homes. ACWA Power trains local staff in China.

Meanwhile, in Morocco, Gotion builds a $5.6 billion battery factory for Europe and local markets. Joint labs create green materials with a 100 GWh yearly capacity.

In Oman, JA Solar’s $564 million plant is producing 6 GW of solar cells. Also, wind turbine projects complement the country’s energy plans. Egypt gets hydrogen projects from LONGi, and Nigeria signs $8.27 billion in clean energy pacts. China brings full technology stacks, turning deserts into power hubs.

These investments lower energy costs, create jobs, and support ambitious national energy plans.

China Expands in Europe

China also targets European energy needs, especially for batteries. Hungary becomes a hub with CATL’s largest European plant in Debrecen. The site aims to produce 100 GWh per year and runs on green power. BMW is a target customer to source from it, and thousands of jobs are expected.

In Spain, CATL and Stellantis are opening a $4.1 billion plant in Zaragoza, producing 50 GWh of batteries starting in 2025. France hosts AESC’s Douai factory, with a target capacity of 40 GWh by 2030. Investments also reach Portugal and Slovakia to avoid EU tariffs.

China brings training programs and research centers, too. Partnerships help local firms gain knowledge and strengthen EV supply chains.

With all these, Europe benefits from faster compliance with car electrification rules by 2035.

Transforming Latin America

In this region, China reshapes Brazil’s auto industry. BYD converts a Ford plant into the region’s largest EV hub, producing 150,000 cars in the first phase. Local steel is used, and later phases add battery production.

Notably, Envision develops a net-zero industrial park, including hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels.

Wind, solar, and hydro projects expand with Chinese partnerships. China Three Gorges develops hydro plants, while grids are upgraded. As such, energy costs drop by 20%, accelerating green transitions in the region.

A Global Strategy with Local Benefits

China’s clean-tech expansion spreads soft power through technology. Research centers abroad train STEM workers, while new agreements ensure long-term cooperation.

A series of high-level bilateral deals were formed in 2025, linking China to emerging nations in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Investments grew by 80% in just one year, and local partners led sales and operations, building trust and reducing tensions.

The Global South, therefore, benefits from cheaper energy, industrial growth, and faster decarbonization with all these projects. Chinese firms remain at the core, guiding global clean-tech supply chains and speeding the transition to net-zero emissions.

China’s Clean-Tech Reach Is Global

China’s $180 billion clean-tech push is reshaping global energy and trade. It creates jobs, reduces energy costs, and spreads green technology. Developing nations gain industrial capacity and know-how while China secures a strong position in global supply chains and expands its influence.

However, careful management is essential. Host nations must enforce local rules, train workers, and build long-term capacity. If done correctly, these investments accelerate global net-zero goals and shift industrial power toward the Global South.

With its so-called NEST (Networks-Efficient-Safe-Transformation) process, the agency aims to make grid regulation “more effective and simpler” and cut bureaucracy. This regulation defines the risk and return profile of network operators.

According to a statement by the agency, operating the grid would become more efficient through the regulatory changes, which should also ensure that only “unavoidable” cost are added to grid fees.

Germany’s electricity grid requires substantial investments to absorb a growing capacity of renewable energy sources and enable the increasing electrification of economic sectors, driven by the rise of heat pumps, electric vehicles, batteries and other energy transition technologies. While the country’s roughly 900 distribution grid operators face billions of euros in costs to implement a more capable and digitalised grid, the BNetzA said it aims to prevent operators from earning excessive profits by passing on unnecessarily high costs to customers.

“We keep an eye on the interests of households, companies, and industry, who ultimately foot the bill,” said BNetzA head Klaus Müller. A key measure decided by the network agency is to continue the incentive regulation for gas and electricity distribution grid operators beyond 2027. BNetzA would set a revenue cap determining the maximum amount of money customers may be charged via network fees. The cap will then be updated for three years into the future, instead of the current five, which the agency said will allow it to reflect actual cost changes during the transformation more quickly. Transmission grid operators are exempt from the changes and regulated separately, the agency added.

Energy industry group BDEW criticised the network agency’s decision, arguing that it does not provide operators with a reliable investment framework. The NEST plan contains several “structural-methodological deteriorations” compared to existing regulation that would ultimately make it harder for companies to invest, commented BDEW head Kerstin Andreae. The lobby group said the regulator’s approach would deprive operators of funds that are needed to expand and modernise the grid.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-12-11 16:04:36.497216

WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ‌is ​planning to delay enforcement of a ‌Biden-era regulation requiring significant cuts in air pollution from vehicles, a senior agency official ​told Reuters.

In April 2024, the EPA finalized a rule requiring significant reductions in so-called ""criteria pollutants"" emitted from passenger and commercial vehicles ‍from the 2027 through 2032 model ​years. As part of a planned delay, the EPA is considering keeping the 2026 standard in place for two ​additional years ⁠to give the agency time to reconsider the Biden-era standards and how the agency sets standards, the official added.

The EPA has separately proposed revoking the scientific finding that justified setting greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles and engines.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Ford, Stellantis, Hyundai and others, ‌in September told EPA the criteria pollutant rule is ""unachievable without significant increases in EV market share, while ​at the ‌same time adding hundreds of ‍dollars of additional ⁠costs to all internal combustion engine vehicles. Several changes should be made to these regulations to produce a more appropriate, cost-effective criteria emission standard.""

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in March announced the plan to reconsider the agency's 2024 rules that would cut passenger vehicle fleetwide tailpipe emissions by nearly 50% by 2032 compared with 2027 projected levels. The EPA previously forecast that between 35% and 56% of new vehicles sold between 2030 and 2032 would need to be electric in order to comply.

Zeldin ​told reporters this week automakers told the agency the EPA requirements ""were causing adverse impacts... By heeding those concerns, it's going to have a positive impact on the auto industry, on auto jobs and bringing down the cost of vehicles and increasing consumer choice.""

The Biden rules require a 50% reduction in criteria pollutants like nitrogen oxides through 2032 for light vehicles and 58% cut for medium-duty vehicles. EPA last year estimated $13 billion in annualized benefits due to reduced emissions of criteria pollutants that contribute to the formation of soot and smog.

The EPA is reviewing if automakers should be able to continue to use electric vehicles to meet the standards and whether the agency should continue to allow credit banking and ​trading. Last week, the Transportation Department proposed ending credit trading as part of a significant rollback of fuel economy standards through 2031.

The automakers also want EPA to implement revised GHG standards as a backstop in case motor vehicle greenhouse gas standards were retained or reinstated in some way. EPA is ​also considering some changes to heavy-duty rules including on warranty obligations and useful life requirements.

This feasibility study is the crucial foundation that will help us present a robust case to investors, government, and the offshore wind industry.","The Crown Estate has announced today that it will support clean energy company, Morwind, to produce a feasibility study to further their proposals for Channel Gateway, a deep-water offshore wind port at Portland. Read the announcement from The Crown Estate.

The proposed wind port facility would bring thousands of jobs to Portland, Weymouth, Dorset and the South West, creating up to £2.7 billion of economic benefit

The feasibility study will explore the technical, environmental, and economic viability of the proposal, marking a significant step towards unlocking new growth opportunities for the region. Key factors such as site suitability, environmental impact and commercial benefits will be assessed.

The proposed Channel Gateway facility is specifically designed to service the offshore wind energy sector, including the manufacturing of components such as concrete substructures, the integration and assembly of large-scale components, marshalling and staging areas for deployment, and operations and maintenance support.

The project represents a transformational opportunity for Portland, Weymouth, and South Dorset. Channel Gateway would create over 1,000 direct jobs at the facility and over 5,000 positions in the wider regional supply chain - bringing long-term economic prosperity to local communities that will be at the heart of Britain's clean energy future.

The facility would provide 700-1,000 metres of deep-water berthing and 50-60 hectares of high load-bearing quayside at Balaclava Bay, making it the largest offshore wind port on the south coast of the UK. If approved and built following the feasibility study and formal consent processes, the facility is expected to be operational around 2032.

The project has received support from key local stakeholders including Weymouth and Portland Town Councils, Lloyd Hatton MP for South Dorset, and Cllr Nick Ireland, Leader of Dorset Council, reflecting strong backing from across the region for the potential economic, social, and employment benefits Channel Gateway could deliver.

Lloyd Hatton MP said: “I am delighted that this clean energy project has received initial funding from the accelerator fund. Channel Gateway will form a key part of the Dorset Clean Energy Super Cluster (DCESC) – a £28 billion investment opportunity that can make the whole of South Dorset a hub for producing clean energy.

“If successful, this cluster will deliver well-paid jobs for local people and help attract fresh green investment to South Dorset. I will continue to work closely with all the key players and Morwind to clear the path for delivery. By securing projects like Channel Gateway, we can finally create hundreds of decent jobs for young people locally.”

Ben Gowers, Director of Morwind, said: ""We are delighted to receive significant backing from The Crown Estate through the Supply Chain Accelerator Fund. As a South West-based company, we are committed to delivering this transformational project for Portland and our region. This funding enables us to undertake the rigorous feasibility work needed to demonstrate that Channel Gateway can become a reality for Portland and Dorset.

""Britain has ambitious offshore wind targets that will build UK resilience, but we simply don't have adequate port infrastructure to deliver them. The Celtic Sea alone has potential for over sixteen gigawatts of offshore wind capacity. Channel Gateway would address this critical gap, and we believe Portland is the ideal location to do so.""

The Crown Estate's Supply Chain Accelerator Fund (SCA2) is a £50 million initiative launched to strengthen the UK's offshore wind supply chain. SCA2 provides funding of up to 50% for early-stage development work, helping UK businesses build the facilities and infrastructure needed to support the growing offshore wind industry.

The SCA2 funding will support site investigations, technical and environmental assessments, planning applications, and developing a comprehensive business case. This feasibility phase, estimated to cost around £1.5 million, is designed to make the project investment-ready, with findings used to secure further funding and progress towards an application for consent for this Strategic National Infrastructure Project.

Cllr Nick Ireland, Leader of Dorset Council commented: ""Funding for the Channel Gateway Project is a major opportunity for the UK and will bring investment and energy to Dorset. We’re working with our unitary neighbours at Somerset, Wiltshire and BCP councils through the Wessex Partnership to boost regional growth and with The Crown Estate, we plan to support offshore wind supply chains, creating jobs, social value and economic growth for local communities.""

Portland is unique and an ideal location due to its sheltered harbour, deep-water access, and having one of the lowest tidal ranges in the UK, allowing 24-hour unconstrained operations. The site's strategic location provides easy access to both UK and European offshore wind markets.

Claire Pearce, Strategic Project Director for the DCESC commented: “I am thrilled that the potential of the Channel Gateway project to support the offshore wind industry in the South West has been recognised by The Crown Estate. Portland has unique capability to support investment in critical port infrastructure and help build UK supply chains, whilst directly connecting to local community to create new opportunities for training and clean energy jobs. This feasibility study will be a key next step on a pathway to delivery”.

Morwind has lined up leading experts for the successful bid, including Haskoning and Entr for technical definition, KPMG for financial advice, Dorset Council to ensure local benefits are fully realised, and the existing Portland Port to deliver mutual value across the site.

Ben Gowers continued: ""What makes the Channel Gateway project special is the collaborative approach we've adopted from the start, including working with the Dorset Clean Energy Super Cluster. This partnership approach ensures we are developing infrastructure that meets the needs of the offshore wind industry while delivering substantial long-term economic benefits for local communities right here in Dorset.

""If the feasibility study demonstrates the project is viable and we secure the necessary approvals and investment, Channel Gateway would create over 1000 direct jobs at the facility itself, with over 5,000 more in the wider supply chain. These would be long-term, skilled positions supported by comprehensive training programmes to ensure local people are prioritised for these opportunities.

""We believe in the importance of engaging with the local communities who will directly benefit from Channel Gateway from the beginning. Public consultation will be a critical part of our approach, hearing from local residents, businesses, and community groups to ensure Channel Gateway, if developed, truly serves the interests of the people of Portland, Weymouth, and South Dorset.

""We're grateful to The Crown Estate for their confidence in our vision. This feasibility study is the crucial foundation that will help us present a robust case to investors, government, and the offshore wind industry. We look forward to working with all our partners and, most importantly, with local communities, to explore how Channel Gateway can support both Britain's clean energy future and the long-term economic prosperity of our region.""",https://www.dorsetcouncil.gov.uk/o/adaptive-media/image/6833031/6834163/extra-small/Portland+Port.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 15:02:01.309819

The Ionna DC fast-charging network deployed its first stations less than a year ago, and already has more than 500 chargers installed at 50 locations. It will be a close race to get to 1,000 chargers by the end of 2025. The team is confident that the milestone should be achieved within several weeks, no later than January. Executing the plan with such precision is no small feat for an all-new company that emerged in early 2024.

Ionna CEO Seth Cutler, in conversation with State Of Charge‘s Tom Moloughney, noted that building the charging network is a process requiring constant adjustments. When deploying the first station, the company believed it had everything in order, but unforeseen challenges arose. Further changes, improvements, and iterations were still necessary to streamline the rollout process.

In the next stage, Ionna plans to accelerate deployment further and build more full-size Rechargeries (and Rechargeries at partners’ locations) rather than simple Relay sites. The smaller sites were easier to build at pace, but now that the company has 4,000+ stalls contracted, higher speeds can be achieved even on larger sites.

Interviews With Founding Members

In addition to showing us Ionna’s headquarters, Tom Moloughney interviewed some of Ionna’s founding members. Recall that the company was founded by eight automakers: BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Toyota.

The main takeaway from the interviews with automakers’ representatives is that they appear satisfied with the progress of the joint venture and emphasize the need to expand the current DC fast-charging infrastructure. That’s even despite some companies having their own charging networks in the US or participating in other infrastructure projects with other charging networks.

Automakers recognize they need a reliable charging network in North America to persuade customers to buy their electric vehicles. Tesla has such a network, but other manufacturers do not necessarily. A joint venture might be the right solution, as individual efforts are often insufficient without scale. An interesting fact is that Toyota was even considering an in-house charging network before joining Ionna’s joint venture.

The real fruits of the Ionna deployments are yet to come. Next year, there will be hundreds of available Ionna locations with the convenient Plug & Charge feature integrated by many EV manufacturers (including several non-members), and the company will launch some discount plans.

At the same time, competition never sleeps. The Tesla Supercharging network expands faster and faster, while other networks are also accelerating. Additionally, networks are integrating NACS (SAE J3400) connectors, which will simplify the user experience in the long term. That’s good for EV drivers and new buyers.

Fans of new sodium battery technology suffered a big disappointment earlier this year when the once-promising US energy storage startup Natron shuttered its doors. However, other US innovators have picked up the slack. That includes California-based Inlyte Energy, which has just completed a successful test of its full scale “salt battery,” aimed at pushing fossil fuels out of the power generation business.

A New Sodium-Based Energy Storage System, Supported By The US Department Of Energy

This year’s abrupt shift in federal energy policy brought much misfortune upon the US wind and solar industries, especially in the offshore wind area. However, energy storage continues to be a focus of attention — and funding — from the US Department of Energy.

In particular, the Energy Department is continuing to zero in on new utility-scale energy storage systems that deliver more electricity, for longer periods of time, than conventional lithium-ion battery arrays.

Inlyte fits the bill. Its iron-sodium formula is scalable to more than 48 hours, though the company states that it can also economically deliver electricity to fit daily 4-10 hour cycles. At four hours, that’s about the same as Li-ion technology but without the need for fire risk mitigation.

Research into sodium-based EV batteries and other energy storage systems devices dates back to the 1980s, though commercial applications proved elusive until a series of breakthroughs occurred in the early 2000s. CleanTechnica has been tracking 21st century progress in the sodium battery field, though Inlyte is a relatively fresh face on these pages.

The company formed in 2021 and quickly drew the attention of the Energy Department in 2022, which provided early stage funding through its ARPA-E SEED program. Inlyte also acquired the UK firm Beta Research — and its team of experienced sodium researchers — in 2022.

CleanTechnica finally caught up with Inlyte in March of this year, when the company announced a partnership with the Swiss sodium battery manufacturer HORIEN Salt Battery Solutions (formerly FZSoNick). The plan involves testing the new iron-sodium energy storage system in the UK, at a facility located in the Derby area, as a step towards the launch of a manufacturing facility in the US.

While that plan was under way, in June Inlyte received a $4 million award from the CiFER (Critical Facility Energy Resilience) program of the US Department of Energy, to support the installation of its long duration energy storage solution at the Alliance Redwoods health care campus in Occidental, California.

In September, Inlyte also announced the next steps in its transition from R&D to commercial application, including a partnership with the leading US utility Southern Company aimed at demonstrating a utility-scale version of its technology in Alabama.

Long Duration Energy Storage Really Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

So far, all has gone according to plan. Earlier today Inlyte announced the successful completion of a factory acceptance test at the Derby facility, with Southern Company personnel keeping a close watch.

“The test demonstrated the performance and integration readiness of Inlyte’s battery storage system — combining advanced sodium metal chloride cells, inverter and control electronics — a major milestone on the company’s path to commercialization,” Inlyte reported.

“The tested system represents the world’s largest sodium metal chloride battery cells and modules ever constructed, capable of storing over 300 kilowatt-hours of energy each,” the company emphasized.

“During the factory test, the module achieved 80% total round-trip efficiency, inclusive of auxiliaries and inverter, which is competitive with high-performance lithium-ion systems and well above the 40 to 70% range typical for other LDES systems,” they elaborated, with LDES being short for long duration energy storage.

Generally speaking, energy storage systems are source-agnostic. A diversified energy provider like Southern Company, for example, could deploy energy storage systems to scavenge excess kilowatts from nuclear power plants. Still, Southern Company has been growing its wind, solar, and energy storage portfolio. Between those three resources, the company already has almost 5.6 gigawatts’ worth of clean power in operation or under construction.

Accordingly, Steve Baxley, the energy storage use, research, and development manager for Southern Company, notes that the grid of the future will be saturated with long duration energy storage systems.

“Energy storage is essential for creating a reliable and flexible energy grid,” Baxley observed in a press statement.

“As the grid evolves toward longer-duration storage, developing solutions that are both low-cost and safe is critical to ensuring affordable, dependable service for customers,” he added.

More Clean Tech Manufacturing For The US

In today’s announcement, Inlyte observed that it has reached the last stages of site selection for the new US factory, with a final decision expected in 2026.

In the meantime, plans are under way for Southern Company to install Inlyte batteries at its Energy Storage Test Site in Wilsonville, Alabama, sometime next year, which also happens to be the host city of the Energy Department’s National Carbon Capture Center.

That’s…somewhat unexpected. Notably, though, Southern Company has a portfolio of energy storage research projects under way, including a partnership in the Energy Storage Research Center, located in Birmingham about about 30 miles from Wilsonville. The ESRC launched in 2019 with a mission to accelerate the development of next-generation energy storage systems. In addition to Southern Company, the other partners at launch included the utility Alabama Power, the Southern Research branch of the University of Alabama, the state of Alabama, and the Electric Power Research Institute as well as Energy Department and its Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.

“The facility will offer a resource for the industry to test and develop energy storage technologies needed to better integrate renewable energy into the power grid, as well as improve reliability and resiliency, while creating more value for customers,” Southern Company explained in a press release dated July 26, 2019.

The Rise Of The Sodium EV Battery

No word yet on whether or not Inlyte is interested in transferring its technology over to the EV field. However, other battery innovators are already on the case. In addition to the well known Chinese firm CATL, keep an eye on the California startup Unigrid.

Mike Collins (GA-10) and co-sponsored by Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Rep. Sam Graves (MO-6). This legislation represents a critical step toward unlocking America’s abundant energy resources, ensuring reliable infrastructure, and reducing unnecessary regulatory delays that drive up costs for families and businesses.

The PERMIT Act restores the original intent of the permitting process by grounding it in sound science and predictable standards—limiting the politicization and bureaucratic overreach that have stalled energy projects for years. By streamlining reviews, this bill will allow the nation to build the key projects needed to move the country towards energy abundance, which is essential for making life more affordable for all Americans.

Why Energy Abundance Matters for Affordability

Energy prices impact virtually everything people buy and need on a day-to-day basis—from groceries and clothing to utilities and transportation. When energy is scarce and expensive, the cost of producing, transporting, and delivering goods skyrocket. By unlocking domestic energy resources and modernizing permitting, the PERMIT Act can help lower costs across the economy, making essentials like food, electricity, and commuting more affordable for hardworking families.

AFP Chief Government Affairs Officer Brent Gardner issued the following statement:

“The PERMIT Act is about more than infrastructure—it’s about empowering Americans to live better, more affordable lives. Energy abundance drives down costs for everything from groceries to gas, and this legislation ensures we can build the systems needed to deliver that energy reliably and responsibly. We urge lawmakers to vote YES on H.R. 3898 and stand with families who deserve a future of opportunity and prosperity.”

The residential battery program is intended to bring affordable, whole-home backup to members of the Farmers Electric Cooperative, while also providing grid balancing services to the wider region.

Base Power will manage the installation, maintenance and service for the life of the battery. The company will deploy 20 MW of 24/7 dispatchable capacity through a fleet of networked residential battery systems. The Farmers Electric Cooperative will keep costs affordable for its members by using the batteries to shave system peak and perform energy arbitrage using Base Power’s proprietary algorithms.

Base Power plans to deliver the capacity over the next year and utilize a front-of-the-meter deployment configuration that ensures member bills are not impacted. The first installations under the program are due to start in January 2026, but farmers in the cooperative can already check if their home is eligible to qualify for the scheme.

Base Power’s ‘Gen 1’ battery is a ground-mounted 11.4 kW/25 kWh system with a typical duration of eight to twelve hours, based on the power use of a typical Texas household. Customers can also avail of a double ground-mounted system with a total storage capacity of 50 kWh and a typical duration of 15 to 24 hours.

The batteries and energy storage systems are safety certified according to industry standards (UL 1973, UL 9540) and the system is also certified against thermal runaway (UL 9540A) and according to inverter safety and grid interconnection standard (UL 1741).

“We are excited to welcome the Farmers membership into a growing community of Texans who are seeking more reliable and affordable backup power,” said Zach Dell, CEO of Base Power. “With our distributed battery platform, we can add meaningful, dispatchable capacity to support growth while providing households with protection against outages.”

Popular business model

Founded in 2023, Base Power has several partnerships with utility companies and electric cooperatives. Its business model of providing backup residential power via virtual power plants (VPPs) in Texas, an area frequently affected by power blackouts and extreme weather events, has proven extremely popular with investors and customers alike.

In February 2025, Base Power expanded into Houston and in March it began a distributed battery storage partnership with Bandera Electric Cooperative, a Texas-based member-owned cooperative. Under the deal, Base Power provides homeowners with battery backup systems as part of Bandera’s home battery program.

Commenting at the time, Dell described the partnership between Bandera and Base Power as “a major milestone – not just for Base, but for co-ops and municipal utilities across Texas.”

The CEO pointed out that such deals prove “utilities don’t have to wait years for storage capacity.”

We’re deploying at a speed never seen before in Texas, helping bring affordable, reliable energy to more communities.”

Justin Lopas, co-founder of Base Power, said in a statement reported by Reuters that the company has deployed more than 100 MWh of residential battery capacity and is building its first factory in Austin and planning its second.

In October, the company announced it had raised $1 billion in funding in a round led by VC firm Addition with other investors including Valor Equity Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, and Lightspeed. This announcement followed the company’s previous fundraise, a Series B round worth $200 million, in April.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1024px-Austin_July_2017_1_Texas_State_Capitol.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 19:02:26.288029

Swift Air Solar II and III will start commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2025.
""We're excited to have achieved this successful financing milestone for the Swift Air Solar projects.
The Swift Air Solar II and III financing represents the first project financing jointly led for Origis by Natixis CIB and Santander.
""Natixis CIB is pleased to have supported Origis in the financing of the Swift Air II and III projects, alongside Santander.","Origis Energy, one of America's leading renewable energy platforms, announced financial close for the Swift Air Solar II and Swift Air Solar III projects in Ector County, Texas. The two projects have a combined nameplate capacity of 313 MWdc. The $290 million senior secured debt facilities include construction debt, term debt and a tax credit bridge loan from Natixis Corporate & Investment Banking (Natixis CIB) and Santander Corporate & Investment Banking (Santander).

Natixis CIB and Santander acted as coordinating lead arrangers and bookrunners, hedging banks, and LC issuers, with Natixis CIB serving as green loan coordinator and administrative agent for the $290 million debt financing package.

Swift Air Solar II and III will start commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2025. The projects will sell energy and renewable energy credits with Houston-based Occidental Power (Oxy) and its subsidiary, OLCV Stratos Development for Swift Air Solar II under two 15-year Power Purchase Agreements, to provide zero-emission solar power for the Direct Air Capture (DAC) facility, STRATOS, currently under construction in the Permian Basin. Earlier this year, Origis started commercial operation of the 184 MWdc Swift Air Solar I project, which is also contracted with Oxy.

Origis is the builder, owner, and operator of Swift Air Solar II and III. The two projects are the first phase of a larger, 600 MW complex in Ector County, in West Texas, with three additional projects expected to provide Full Notice to Proceed before the end of the year.

""We're excited to have achieved this successful financing milestone for the Swift Air Solar projects. These projects further demonstrate Origis Energy's ability to scale efficiently and mark another step toward bringing over 3 GW of long-term contracted assets into commercial operation by the end of 2026,"" said Alice Heathcote, Chief Financial Officer, Origis Energy. ""A big thank you to Natixis CIB and Santander for their ongoing partnership on both these transactions and beyond.""

The Swift Air Solar II and III financing represents the first project financing jointly led for Origis by Natixis CIB and Santander.

Samsung SDI claims an advantage over its rivals in that it is the only non-Chinese manufacturer capable of supplying US customers with prismatic cells.
This makes its batteries a simpler drop-in replacement for system integrators accustomed to China-made prismatic LFP cells, the company has said.
In addition to cells, Samsung SDI plans to manufacture complete, integrated BESS solutions within the US.
The solar and energy storage owner-operator specialises in distribution-connected energy storage.","In early November, the Korean company revealed it would begin mass production before the end of 2025 and planned to establish 30GWh of annual production capacity for energy storage batteries in the US by the end of next year.

Around the same time, media outlets The Korea Herald and Reuters both reported that Samsung SDI was in talks over a multi-year, multi-gigawatt-hour BESS battery supply deal with Tesla.

Those reports are still unconfirmed and likely to fuel speculation that Tesla is the undisclosed customer behind the KRW2 trillion deal announced yesterday.

However, in truth, the rising demand for stationary grid storage in the US is such that there are numerous other possible candidates. The manufacturer’s announcement was ambiguously worded, making it unclear whether the deal might also cover complete BESS solutions.

That type of deal would not fit the profile of Tesla, which makes its own Megapack utility-scale BESS products using third-party cells and as of next year, some LFP cells made in-house in the US.

Samsung SDI said then that it would put its energy storage system (ESS) business at the heart of a turnaround strategy to mitigate slower-than-expected growth in its electric vehicle (EV) business (ESN Premium article).

US cell manufacturing head start for Korean providers

The company, like fellow South Korean manufacturers LG Energy Solution and SK On, is retooling some of its EV battery production lines in the US to produce ESS cells, allowing them a significant head start in a market increasingly focused on domestic content supply chains.

A consultant, speaking anonymously with ESN Premium due to the political nature of the subject, stated a couple of weeks ago that South Korean manufacturers’ announcements “could be enough to meet domestic demand for BESS.”

This comes amid the introduction by the US government of foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions that would prevent projects or manufacturing facilities from availing of tax credit incentives if using Chinese-made products or material assistance over a certain threshold.

That threshold all but prevents any project using Chinese cells from qualifying for the investment tax credit (ITC), given that cells comprise the largest single portion of capex cost.

Samsung SDI claims an advantage over its rivals in that it is the only non-Chinese manufacturer capable of supplying US customers with prismatic cells. This makes its batteries a simpler drop-in replacement for system integrators accustomed to China-made prismatic LFP cells, the company has said.

It also touted several key safety features of its designs, including an aluminium casing and a proprietary so-called No Thermal Propagation (No TP) technology, which separates cells with thermal insulation layers.

In addition to cells, Samsung SDI plans to manufacture complete, integrated BESS solutions within the US. It showcased two new products from that range at the RE+ clean energy trade show in September in Las Vegas, the LFP-based SAMSUNG Battery Box (SBB) 2.0, as well as SBB 1.7, which uses nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (NCA) cells.

Trina expands agreement with first US customer

Trina Storage has expanded a strategic partnership with US BESS developer Lightshift Energy, agreeing to supply equipment to a portfolio of projects totalling more than 1GWh.

Trina Storage will supply its Elementa 2.0 and Elementa 2.5 BESS solutions to the developer, owner and operator, which was formerly known as Delorean Power.

The BESS arm of vertically integrated Chinese solar PV manufacturer Trinasolar will be among the companies figuring out how viable their pathways to the US market will continue to be post-FEOC (ESN Premium article).

Chinese companies still have a significant runway of safe harbour projects where sufficient progress has been made to qualify for tax credits ahead of the shutters coming down.

Some sources have also suggested that batteries made in China may even be cheap enough that large customers with healthy balance sheets and fast turnaround project timelines may opt to buy them despite the lack of tax credit support.

Chinese companies may also explore other options that could help them meet FEOC rules by manufacturing in the US under compliant ownership structures, or in non-FEOC countries.

Trina Storage is known primarily as a system integrator, and although it uses in-house LFP cells for projects in China, it has used third-party suppliers for projects elsewhere, including the US.

It completed its first US projects in 2024, delivering four sites in Massachusetts totalling 16MW/64MWh in the summer for Lightshift Energy. The developer built those projects in response to a solicitation held by Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company (MMWEC), an organisation representing multiple municipal utilities in the New England state.

The solar and energy storage owner-operator specialises in distribution-connected energy storage. In May, Lightshift said it would build the biggest BESS to date in Vermont, a 16MW/52MWh system scheduled to come online in early 2026, then in October, the company closed US$75 million financing with KeyBanc Capital Markets, following capital raises of US$40 million in July and US$100 million in April 2024.

“Once you plant the tree, it takes four years to harvest it,” James said. “But once you plant your last tree, it takes four years to get out of the business.”

On Sunday, they sold their last tree.

Nestled in the pineywoods between Tyler and Longview, Danville Farms Christmas trees have become an East Texas staple for thousands of families over the last 40 years. Like so many December weekends before this one, families from across the region converged in search of the perfect tree. But this weekend was their last chance to do it here.

Customers bundled up as the temperature quickly dropped Sunday afternoon. One mom had her toddler wrapped in multiple blankets to keep him warm as they sat next to a fire, his feet kept sneaking out into the cold air. Fires roared in pits, a snack shack served warm goodies near a three-walled shop where customers paid for their trees and wreaths.

Three generations of Robinsons milled about, helping customers, chatting with each other, and reminiscing on the many long years they had worked on this farm. Customers said they came for just one last tree before the business closed.

“We have excellent customers,” James said. “Some of them have been coming ever since we opened.”

At 82, James was glad to see the last day of his tree farm. He had tended to thousands of trees for years and was ready to slow down and get to that honey-do list Mary was curating.

Robinson’s story is similar to many retiring farmers with no successors. Robinson’s farm provided well for his family and set his three daughters up for success in their chosen fields. And when it came time to decide if they would close the farm or name a successor, the family chose to let it go, to end the enterprise on their terms.

This could be a sad story, but it isn’t.

“We lose probably two or three farms every year due to retirement, or no one being able to manage it anymore because of their age,” said Stan Reed, the executive secretary of the Texas Christmas Tree Growers Association. “And then we also experience probably 10 or 15 new farms opening up every year.”

The number of tree farms has grown in Texas, Reed said. He has seen firsthand an increase in interest from younger farmers.

Furthermore, more Texans are shopping for real Christmas trees, according to an analysis by Texas A&M Agrilife. The number of real-tree purchases in Texas grew by 26% between 2017 and 2022.

Across the lawn at the Danville farm, William Griffin and his wife, Jamie, sat next to the fire with their two little boys. Griffin had visited this farm every year with his grandparents and cousins until his grandfather’s health began to decline. The tradition fell to the wayside as the family grieved.

That spark was reignited by William and a group of his cousins, who were now parents themselves.

“We want to preach that family is the most important, and stuff like these traditions keep that alive, they keep that going,” William said. “And hopefully my kids will do that with their kids.”

Griffin isn’t sure where he’ll take his family next year to continue the custom. But this year his smile grew as his parents arrived, and then his cousins. It was almost time to go pick out the tree.

Mary and James will miss people like the Griffins the most, folks whose names they may have forgotten but whose faces become familiar year after year.

James got his start when he and some of his buddies opened a small Christmas tree operation in the early 1980s. Business did fairly well, and Robinson wanted to do more. He worked out a deal with Lloyd and Evelyn Bolding, a local family with acres to spare. They started by growing peaches and blueberries, but then the Danville Farms Christmas Trees were born.

Business was slow at first. Robinson was happy to sell 100 trees in the first few years.

“About three years into it, I asked, ‘When are we gonna make any money?’” Mary laughed, recalling the struggle of those first few years.

Eventually, their customer base expanded thanks to word of mouth, and eventually the internet, and East Texans began adding a trip to the farm to their Christmas bucket lists. This year, the Robinsons saw hundreds of families on Black Friday.

Buying a Christmas tree here is not like grabbing a fir in front of a grocery store.

Customers drive down a dirt road through thickets and past ponds. The Robinson family and staff welcome visitors, who are allowed to explore the farm, pick and cut the tree down themselves before hopping on a tractor to ride back to the main area.

The tree is then cleaned, tied up and made ready for its trip home. Customers pay about $60 for a good-looking, 6-foot tree.

“The most enjoyable thing about it is the children,” James said. “The children come, they’re happy. They want to go on a ride. They want to get a tree. They want to get a s’more, eat some peanuts, and they’re just happy.”

While customers only see the farm for a few weeks late in the East Texas fall, the farm was a year-round operation that kept James busy. And now, he’s tired. He wants to turn his attention to family, a small personal garden and his favorite fishing spot.

The Robinsons, when asked, have encouraged their customers to seek out Solstice Tree Farm next year. Solstice is a new Christmas Tree Farm operation about 30 miles away, run by a local couple who have practiced a Christian ministry for years. They’re raising their three girls on the tree farm.

Kathy Adams, his middle child, was in third grade when her father started the farm. She fondly recalls those days spent among the trees. She’s grateful for what it gave her family. But now she’s looking forward to something new.

“We might actually get to cook together on Thanksgiving and watch football and do what normal families do,” Adams laughed. “I don’t know what it’s gonna be like. I’m sure we’ll start a new tradition and we’ll find things to do to fill the time.”

With gasoline demand projected to decline over the next decade, expanding E15 access is emerging as one of the most important levers for protecting long-term ethanol demand — and the billions of bushels of corn tied to it.

Ethanol currently consumes about 5.6 billion bushels of corn annually, but blend rates have stalled near E10, and outdated summer volatility rules restrict E15 sales in many states. Even with EPA’s temporary summer waivers, the lack of a permanent policy creates uncertainty for retailers and slows investment in pumps, tanks, and signage needed to grow adoption.

For corn farmers, the stakes are large. Without higher blends, domestic ethanol use could fall by 400 million bushels over the next decade. By contrast, moving entirely to year-round E15 could require up to 2.4 billion additional bushels of corn each year—a transformational shift for rural economies and biofuel markets.

Regionally, more than 3,000 U.S. stations already offer E15, and major automakers approve it for modern vehicles.

The idea was to create a vertically integrated battery supply chain for Ford’s next-generation electric trucks and SUVs.

But today, SK confirmed reports that they are dissolving the JV structure entirely.

According to the announcement, Ford will take full ownership of the two battery plants in Kentucky. One of these plants had already begun initial operations earlier this year, while the second is still under construction.

SK On, meanwhile, will take full ownership of the BlueOval City battery plant in Tennessee.

Ford acknowledged the announcement from SK, but it refused to comment:

We are aware of SK’s disclosure and we have nothing further to share at this time.

The South Korean battery maker was surprisingly candid about the reasoning, stating that the split allows them to “supply batteries for both electric vehicles and energy storage systems not only to Ford but to a wider range of customers.”

This confirms that SK On didn’t want to be tied exclusively to Ford’s production volumes, which have been fluctuating wildly over the last year as the automaker adjusts its EV strategy. SK On explicitly mentioned expanding into the Energy Storage System (ESS) market,a sector that is booming right now, using the capacity at the Tennessee plant.

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

This comes amid narratives of “slowing EV demand” from legacy automakers and a changing political landscape in the US that has introduced uncertainty following the end of federal incentives.

Electrek’s Take

This is a huge deal, and frankly, it smells like trouble for Ford’s original volume targets.

When you form a multi-billion-dollar JV, you do it to lock in supply and share the massive capital burden. Breaking it up less than four years later, before all the plants are even running, suggests that the original plan is effectively dead.

In short, it would suggest Ford does not want the battery capacity from the factory it gave to SK.

This is not exactly surprising considering Ford’s pullback of EV plans, such as the F-150 Lightning, recently.

For SK On, this looks like a smart pivot. If Ford isn’t buying enough cells to fill the lines because they are delaying EV models or pivoting to hybrids, SK needs the freedom to sell those batteries to Hyundai, VW, or into the energy grid storage market, which is insatiable right now.

They basically just freed up 45 GWh of capacity in Tennessee to sell to whoever writes the biggest check.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/BlueOvalSK-Battery-Park_03.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-11 14:00:28.210882

“We’re experiencing growing interest in our service area from data centers,” he said.
‘Pick me’ state While the commission denied OG&E’s rate hike request, the prospect of higher electricity bills for Oklahoma residents has sparked backlash from an Oklahoma legislator.
PSO would like higher rates to cover the cost of new generation capacity to serve more than 1,000 megawatts of power demand from new data centers planned near Tulsa.
And in return, data centers would only create nine or 10 full-time jobs in the community, she says.","Oklahoma takes pride in relatively low electricity rates compared to most other states. In fact, the low cost of power is part of the pitch economic developers use to lure new jobs and investment to the Sooner State.

But the days of lower electricity rates may be coming to an end as more and more AI-driven data centers pop up in Oklahoma City, Tulsa and smaller communities across the state. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission is already receiving rate increase proposals from utilities trying to build the power plants they need to keep up with the coming demand.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Oklahoma’s data center load has placed the state among the nation’s leaders in commercial sector electricity consumption growth.

And in a third-quarter earnings call with investment analysts, OG&E Chief Executive Sean Trauschke said Oklahoma’s power industry is entering a new era of commercial growth.

“We’re experiencing growing interest in our service area from data centers,” he said. “Negotiations and conversations are progressing.”

“While the electric power industry is entering an exciting new era, OG&E is uniquely positioned at the forefront,” he told analysts. “We’ve been experiencing load growth that far surpasses national trends, and data center loads will certainly be incremental to our already strong load growth.”

“At the heart of that growth is OG&E’s affordability. It’s key to our community success and central to our planning as we move ahead,” the CEO said.

In a rate increase application filed last May, OG&E asked the Oklahoma Corporation Commission for permission to raise rates to help fund construction of two additional generating units at its Horseshoe Lake facility in Harrah, east of Oklahoma City.

The increase would help compensate the company for construction of more than 400 megawatts of additional power generation capacity to meet surging demands. But in an order last month, the commission denied OG&E’s request, advising the company to return for a rate review once the facilities are complete and operational.

In a statement this week, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission acknowledged power demand issues that data centers are creating, and that it sees the potential need to expand generation and distribution infrastructure.

Work is underway with OG&E, PSO and others to plan and forecast future demand, and the commission will consider any proposed investments in generation resources before allowing utilities to recover costs from consumers. Those decisions will be based on need, prudency and whether resulting rates are fair, just and reasonable, the commission said.

‘Pick me’ state

While the commission denied OG&E’s rate hike request, the prospect of higher electricity bills for Oklahoma residents has sparked backlash from an Oklahoma legislator.

State Rep. Amanda Clinton (D-Tulsa) is voicing alarm over what she says is uncontrolled growth of hyperscale data centers that demand volumes of power equal to small cities and millions of gallons of water per day, affecting cost of living and quality of life across the state.

She says utilities would like to transfer the cost of accommodating data center power demand to all rate payers, citing recent rate increase proposals from OG&E and Public Services Company of Oklahoma. PSO would like higher rates to cover the cost of new generation capacity to serve more than 1,000 megawatts of power demand from new data centers planned near Tulsa.

“I have a problem with that,” she said. “Regular residential households are becoming more efficient all the time through refrigerators, dishwashers, and washers and dryers that are more energy efficient. Households are actually using less electricity than they have in the past. But the grid is requiring so much more to accommodate hyperscale data centers.”

“I just feel like that is not a cost that we should bear,” Clinton said. “I mean, I didn’t request 1,000 megawatts. Did you? I think it’s very unfair. If large tech wants to come into Oklahoma and they need all this power, they should pick up the tab.

“I like my modern conveniences just as much as anyone else,” she said. “Generative AI is making our lives more convenient and our work more manageable, and data centers are going to be necessary, but how do we strike a balance between putting Oklahomans first and our natural resources first?”

Clinton said she is pushing for legislation in the coming session to require greater transparency regarding data center development. She would like the Oklahoma Department of Commerce to create a directory of data centers with information about who the end user is, how much water they use, and how much electricity they use.

I don’t think that’s asking too much,” she said. “Oklahomans deserve to know who’s operating in our state.”

Clinton is concerned smaller towns and communities lack the resources they need to properly vet data center proposals, leading to poor decision-making.

She’s concerned about local communities granting precarious water consumption allowances and local property tax breaks as incentives to move in. And in return, data centers would only create nine or 10 full-time jobs in the community, she says.

“I worry about the tools and the resources available to these rural and suburban communities to properly vet these projects,” Clinton said.

Decisions involving many millions of dollars are in the hands of small-town mayors and city councilors who are serving in volunteer positions or are being paid small stipends without professional staff to help vet project proposals, she said.

“It’s a little concerning how insular these decisions are being made. Local communities hold the cards,” she said. “They’re in the driver’s seat. They do not need to give any concessions to these companies because if one of them passes, another one is going to come down the pike.”

She likened the state to a puppy saying, “Pick me, pick me.”

“We’re at a pivotal point in history right now with generative AI becoming more advanced every single day,” Clinton said. “And this is just the tip of the iceberg. People need to get plugged-in in their communities, they need to separate fact from fiction, and they need to get educated about this topic so they can let their local leaders and their state leaders know how they feel.”",https://journalrecord.com/files/2025/12/DatacenterPage-2-Photo-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 17:02:44.912944

Most African countries run isolated national grids that are small, costly and unevenly supplied. Regional energy interconnectivity is the key to unlocking efficiency, affordability and renewable growth.

Africa has a continent-wide roadmap for integration, but success depends on coordinated action and investor confidence.

Africa is a continent rich in energy potential. From the sun-drenched plains of the Sahel to the mighty rivers of Central Africa, the continent holds vast reserves of renewable and non-renewable energy. Sixty percent of the world’s “best solar resources” are found on the continent.

Yet, it receives less than 3% of global clean energy investment and more than 600 million Africans still lack access to reliable electricity.

The fragmented reality of Africa’s power systems

National grids on the continent are often small, underfunded and poorly maintained. Brazil’s domestic transmission network is longer in total kilometres of line than the combined transmission grids of 38 African countries.

While generation capacity across the continent is growing rapidly, the transmission and distribution networks needed to deliver that power are lagging.

What’s more, most African countries operate isolated national power grids, each designed to serve domestic needs. Connections with neighbouring countries are rare, creating a fragmented energy landscape.

This fragmentation leads to several challenges:

Uneven distribution of power: Some countries, such as Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, generate more electricity than they can consume. Others, such as South Sudan and Liberia, suffer frequent blackouts.

High electricity costs: Small national grids lack economies of scale, making electricity generation and distribution more expensive.

Limited viability of large renewable projects: Without the ability to export surplus power, countries hesitate to invest in large-scale solar farms or hydropower dams.

The lack of power interconnectivity across Africa also means countries are missing out on the developmental and economic benefits that energy trade could bring.

Regional interconnectivity, a game-changer

Regional energy interconnectivity – linking national grids to create a continent-wide electricity network – offers transformative benefits for Africa.

By interconnecting national grids, African countries could trade electricity among themselves, just as they trade goods and services, allowing them to share electricity during peak demand or outages, enhancing energy security and reducing dependence on costly emergency solutions.

Larger, regional markets also enable economies of scale, allowing for bulk purchasing, shared infrastructure and more efficient resource allocation, ultimately lowering costs for utilities and consumers.

Access to broader markets also encourages investment in renewable energy projects, as surplus power from solar, wind or hydro sources can be traded across borders. This integration supports economic growth and industrialization, providing reliable, affordable electricity to drive manufacturing, job creation and digital innovation.

Recent decades have seen substantial progress on this front, with the establishment of five regional power pools. The Southern African Power Pool, the West African Power Pool, the Eastern Africa Power Pool, the Central Africa Power Pool and the North African Power Pool have each improved cross-border electricity access and trade.

While these efforts remain at different stages of development and operation, they are paving the way for a future centralized interconnectivity programme that unifies the continent’s power systems and enables seamless energy exchange across regions.

The African Union (AU) has articulated a vision for a continent-wide interconnected power system (the Africa Single Electricity Market) that will serve 1.3 billion people across 55 countries, making it the biggest electricity market in the world.

In recent years, the Continental Power Systems Master Plan (CMP) has provided a much-needed strategic framework to integrate Africa’s five regional power pools into a single, resilient and scalable electricity network, laying the foundation for a truly interconnected energy future.

With demand expected to triple by 2040, translating this vision into reality will be essential to sustainably meet Africa’s energy needs. That’s where the recent Africa Ten-Year Infrastructure Investment Plan for Cross-Border Interconnectivity (TYIIP) comes into play.

Co-ordinated by the AU Development Agency – New Partnership for Africa’s Development, under priority 3 of the G20 Energy Transitions Working Group, this plan outlines a pipeline of regional transmission projects to be implemented between 2026 and 2036.

Phased over a decade and established in partnership with the various Power Pools, this plan embodies Africa’s commitment to a truly integrated continental grid.

One continent, one grid

Africa stands at a pivotal moment. Investing in Africa means tapping into 60% of global renewable energy potential and a $2.5 trillion infrastructure opportunity, driving sustainable global growth. The European – and more recently ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations – experiences with regional grid integration offer useful lessons for Africa to build on.

With the CMP’s vision and the TYIIP now out, the continent has a clear path toward a unified, resilient and sustainable energy future. What’s missing now?

Coordinated efforts among countries hosting future network infrastructure projects are essential to create enabling environments that improve predictability for investors. Beyond political commitments, risk mitigation will remain paramount.

Examples of collaboration among banks, development finance institutions and multilateral institutions to reduce counterparty risks and improve lending conditions have been successful.

Corridor approaches, taking a portfolio view of project developments, also offer greater scalability, synergies and more interesting risk profiles than isolated project preparation.

Lastly, beyond the very critical first step of project identification, helping provide greater market visibility, raising the profiles of these projects will now be key to getting investors interested.

To support this effort, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with key African stakeholders, will host a series of dialogues showcasing the biggest transmission and generation projects identified under the TYIIP as requiring investment to propel the continent’s energy transition.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_DarlZxO3w9GGGK29HJ8KgyK1DEKM4uxX4riDc43sgls.JPG,N,,2025-12-11 16:04:40.247789

But details about most projects are kept in the dark. If you know of a data center coming to your community, or if you have thoughts or information on data centers in Oklahoma, please fill out our form.

Big tech companies have plans to build more than a dozen data centers in Oklahoma to keep up with increased computing needs from artificial intelligence. Some will require enough electricity to power entire cities. Oklahoma’s two largest utility companies are investing more than a billion dollars in new sources of power to keep up with demand and plan to pass on some of the cost to residential customers.

The Frontier found at least 18 data center projects in the state that are either now under construction or awaiting government approvals. The newsroom used public announcements, land records, meeting agendas and air permit applications to compile that count.

The state’s two largest utilities, Oklahoma Gas and Electric and Public Service Company of Oklahoma, have said in regulatory filings that new demand from data centers and other industries will require more power than they can now produce. The utilities are already looking to pass the cost of new transmission lines and power generation on to all customers, including residential users. Though power prices are lower compared to the nation at large, Oklahoma residential customers already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the region, second behind Texas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The average per-kilowatt hour price for Oklahoma residents was up 7% in September from the same time the previous year.

John Laws, Gov. Kevin Stitt’s former secretary of budget and now a consultant for OG&E, told state regulators in May that big new users want assurances that OG&E will have enough power to fill their needs before they sign agreements with utilities. Laws noted that these big new users come from a variety of industries, including manufacturing, refineries, the federal government, data centers and cryptocurrency.

“The changes in recent prospective loads are unprecedented, both in the sheer size and the volume of requests,” Laws said.

A report from the Corporation Commission’s Public Utility Division in June warned that the data center boom could lead utilities to overestimate demand based on speculative proposals and unverified projections. Some data centers could close or never be built, leaving the remaining ratepayers in the state to pay for billions of dollars in new power generation.

Historically, adding new large customers has helped spread fixed costs across a broader base, supporting affordability for all customers, said Matt Rahn, a spokesperson for PSO.

“Our commitment is to protect our existing customers by ensuring new customers, including data centers, pay their fair share or contribution to the costs their load on the system creates,” Rahn said. “We’re also evaluating a large energy use tariff to further ensure prices reflect the cost to serve each customer group, keeping rates fair and balanced for all.”

Ken Miller, vice president of public and regulatory affairs for OG&E, said the company is building protections for existing customers into its new large load contracts and working to develop a new tariff for larger customers.

“The need is just tremendous,” Miller said. “As you see, not just here in Oklahoma, but the country and world, the world is electrifying, and we are all trying to keep up with that increased pace of electrification.”

A few of the proposed data centers in Oklahoma include plans for solar energy facilities to power them, including a set of five data centers planned in Stillwater and at least one of two proposed Google data centers near Muskogee, land and air permitting records show.

Oklahoma passed a law earlier this year that gives companies more options to buy or generate power on-site. But the law does not require companies to generate their own power.

New state law could add charges to electric bills

Another new state law, Senate Bill 998, which took effect in August allows utilities to recoup costs from customers to build new natural gas power plants as soon as construction begins.

OG&E lobbied for the new law. The utility believes it will save ratepayers money in the long run as it keeps financing costs from building up over the years, Miller said.

“It’s akin to a mortgage and you’re building a house and paying off the interest early instead of later,” he said. “The savings to customers comes by eliminating the long-term financing of those construction costs.”

But Oklahoma attorney A.J. Singer, who represents the Oklahoma chapter of AARP, says it’s more like an apartment building where current tenants pay more each month so the landlord can build new rental units, while current renters will never see any actual benefit. AARP lobbied against the legislation and believes it will only benefit large, for-profit utility companies, said Joy McGill, AARP’s associate state director of advocacy.

OG&E has already unsuccessfully tried this year to use the new law to charge customers more while it builds two new natural gas power plants as part of a $506.4-million plan to increase generating capacity. OG&E proposed charging customers an average of 55 cents extra per month starting in 2026, which would increase each year to an average $4.41 a month by 2031.

The Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities in the state, rejected OG&E’s cost-recovery plan in November because the new law hadn’t taken effect yet when the company submitted its application. The commission will allow OG&E to recover some of its costs to build the new generators, but only after they are put into service and provide power to customers. The average cost to consumers was not included in the Corporation Commission order.

The commission also ordered OG&E to come up with a plan to create a new tariff on large users like data centers by July 2026, in hopes of defraying future costs for residential customers. Both AARP and the Oklahoma Industrial Energy Consumers group have asked the commission to reconsider its decision to allow OG&E to recover costs from customers, though the commission has yet to rule on that matter.

In its current case before the Corporation Commission, Public Service Company of Oklahoma is also seeking to pass along the costs of building and buying new generation to customers, including in-progress construction costs to build two new natural gas generators.

PSO said in its application filed in September that it plans to purchase and build more than $1.25 billion in new sources of energy and will seek to recover $539.8 million in construction costs from ratepayers to build new natural gas-fired generators that are part of the expansion plan.

A Corporation Commission administrative law judge is scheduled to hear the case in February.

Singer said AARP will likely oppose the request, but he hopes the Corporation Commission will work to require big industrial users to shoulder more of the cost in the future.

“There needs to be some kind of guarantee from these data centers that if the utility and its ratepayers expend a bunch of funds to build out infrastructure and generation for these extremely large loads, that they’re going to be here in 15, 20, 30 years,” he said.

A shortage of power

Demand for electricity from data centers is expected to triple by 2030, making up around 14% of all power usage in the U.S., according to a recent report by McKinsey & Company.

Most of the increased demand comes from commercial and industrial customers that are coming on to the grid and “with electric needs far greater than PSO has experienced in the past,” Matthew Horeled, vice president of regulatory and finance for PSO said in testimony before the Corporation Commission.

As of September, PSO had 11 new “large load” customers under letters of agreement or contract, representing about 779 megawatts, enough energy to power around half a million average homes.

Several industrial parks in PSO’s service area were also in late-stage negotiations with large-load projects, Horeled said.

Unless it acquires new sources of power, PSO will face a 31% power deficit of 3,124 megawatts by 2031, a gap that could power 2 million average Oklahoma homes, according to its application to recover costs from customers.

One new customer that recently signed a preliminary letter of agreement with PSO will eventually need over 1,000 megawatts at any given time, roughly enough to power 666,000 average Oklahoma homes.

OG&E predicts that it too will eventually see a significant generation deficit unless it invests in new sources of power. By 2035, OG&E projects it will face a shortfall of 3,459 megawatts to meet demand, or about 38% higher than it is capable of generating.

OG&E is already preparing its next request for proposals to acquire new electrical generation resources, which will require it to bring a new application before the Corporation Commission in order to recover the cost of new generation from customers, a spokesman for the company said.",https://www.readfrontier.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-11 13:02:51.362400

For decades, demand for electrical power has remained stable. Utilities could count on highly predictable growth patterns to guide their capacity planning. However, the power requirements of AI and data are placing increasing pressure on power infrastructure, creating significant challenges for grid operators, utilities and developers alike.

While data centers aren’t the sole driver of rising load, they are a dominant factor shaping future demand forecasts. The power intensity of Artificial Intelligence/High-Performance Computing (AI/HPC) and the ever-growing power needs of cloud infrastructure are key drivers. To illustrate the power-intensity of AI, you only need to glance at NVIDIA’s product roadmap. An upcoming version of its flagship GPU solutions is projected to use 1MW – a volume of power that was the IT load of an entire data hall not long ago. Soon, that amount of power will be used by a single rack, not to mention the cooling and other supporting system power needed to support the required operating environment for these new products.

The power consumption of this equipment, combined with the overall growth in cloud-based IT, is leading to data center projects that require a volume of power previously unthinkable just a few years ago. Recent projects announced in locations such as Texas and Louisiana will utilize 1 GW, 2GW or more – equivalent to the demand from an entire city concentrated into just a few buildings. How much power does that add up to across the country? A recent research report by Goldman Sachs predicts that power demands from AI and data centers will reach 92 GW as early as 2027, driven by a volume of investment by major tech firms that is rapidly approaching $1 trillion.

How can utilities expand the capacity of the U.S. electrical grid to keep pace with this skyrocketing demand? It’s a question that comes up in every conversation I have with peers at utilities, and it dominates every industry conference I have attended recently. One thing that is certain is that this challenge will not be solved with a single solution and will require collaboration from both supply-side and demand-side stakeholders.

Building additional capacity and flexibility into the grid with renewable energy DERs, for example, will be an important part of the overall solution. However, a recent Duke University study poses a fascinating hypothesis regarding this issue: What if we don’t need to build new or expanded power plants to meet the power demands of AI and data centers?

Duke’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability recently published a report titled “Rethinking Load Growth: Assessing the Potential for Integration of Large Flexible Loads in US Power Systems” that outlines a strategy for utilities to meet the nearly 100 GW of projected power demands of AI and data centers with existing grid capacity. The key is for utilities and data center operators to work together in a collaborative way that utilizes flexible load management.

Rather than focusing capacity planning solely on total load, utilities would also need to focus on load shape and flexibility. A critical facet of flexible load management is for utilities to incorporate periodic demand curtailment as part of their collaboration with AI companies and data center operators. Duke’s research showed that if AI and cloud data center operators were willing to accept short-duration curtailments of less than 50 hours per year, utilities could accommodate a massive amount of new data center load without having to add more generation capacity. During these periods of curtailment, data center operators would shift workloads by controlling compute and storage resources– strategies that tech companies are already incorporating into their operational strategies. This approach is suitable for end-user-owned data centers but may not be as feasible for wholesale and colocation data center operators. However, utilizing onsite generation during load reduction events is an operating strategy that could be more broadly applicable to all ownership types.

According to the study:

“Flexibility allows large electricity users to temporarily reduce consumption during periods of grid stress by shifting workloads, utilizing on-site generation, or adjusting operations. By leveraging flexibility, new large loads can be interconnected more quickly while reducing the need for premature investment in additional power plants and transmission lines….”

Their point about reducing the delays for interconnection is a critical part of the story because accelerated interconnections help make this a win-win for data center operators and utilities. By agreeing to work with utilities to allow for short-duration curtailments, data center companies would benefit significantly from much faster approvals of interconnection requests. This is a significant benefit to data center operators, given the backlog of interconnections that is leading to substantial, costly delays for data center projects. The current backlog is driven in large part by the inflexibility of current requests for large loads, which are based on guarantees for a 100% maximum electricity draw 24/7/365, regardless of other demands on the grid. It is this rigidity in those terms that drives the need for significant upgrades to the grid.

The most time-intensive and costly infrastructure upgrades required for new interconnections are often associated with expanding the transmission system to deliver electricity during the most stressed grid conditions (Gorman et al. 2024). Suppose a new load is assumed to require firm interconnection service and operate at 100% of its maximum electricity draw at all times, including during system-wide peaks. In that case, it is far more likely to trigger the need for significant upgrades, such as new transformers, reconductoring of transmission lines, circuit breakers, or other substation equipment. Introducing more flexibility into those terms would enable utilities to expedite interconnection requests, allowing data center operators to plan with greater confidence and deliver facilities to customers more quickly.

In September 2025, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) issued a Level 2 Industry Recommendation for Large Load Interconnection, Study, Commissioning, and Operations. Utility system planners and operators are advised to adopt a proactive approach to enhance system reliability through actions focused on interconnection, planning, operational readiness, and disturbance recovery. Strategies that leverage NERC recommendations, combined with innovative and flexible load interconnection prioritization, can help overcome current challenges and accelerate AI data center integration.

Flexible load management is not achieved with a flip of the switch, though. Making it a reality will require utilities to take important steps such as utilizing transmission constraint modeling, creating demand performance frameworks, revisiting how they construct rate design, employing a more collaborative approach to working with large-load customers, proactive reliability strategies, and more. At PPL, we proved that orchestrated energy can unlock real flexibility. In the first year of our Pennsylvania connected distributed generation pilot, curtailment amounted to only 9.5 kWh across 768 events, representing less than one percent of annual output. Nevertheless, the program still expanded hosting capacity, enabled same-day interconnection approvals, and reduced upgrade costs. The result was faster timelines, lower costs, more satisfied customers, and, most importantly, a replicable model for integrating even the largest new loads, including data centers.

Having a unified, holistic strategy for planning, asset management, resiliency, and regulatory compliance provides a strong foundation for achieving each of those pillars of flexible load management. But even if your utility does not embrace the specific model proposed in the Duke study, taking steps to build more flexibility into how you meet growing demand still has significant value – including for better leveraging renewables and other DERs to meet overall demand and peak demand scenarios. These initiatives are hard work, but worth it to successfully meet demand without requiring massive capital investments that put the burden on ratepayers.

The split marks a reset for one of the major U.S. electric vehicle battery partnerships, coming as slowing EV demand and the loss of U.S. subsidies push South Korean battery makers to reshape their U.S. strategies and accelerate expansion into the energy storage systems business.

SK On, a subsidiary of SK Innovation, which supplies automakers including Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp, said a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will assume full ownership and operate the Tennessee plant.

""The production start schedule for the Tennessee plant remains flexible at this time, as it is related to the ownership transition,"" SK On said.

In 2022, SK On and Ford invested $11.4 billion to build the joint battery plants in the United States.

SK On said the move reflected a strategic overhaul of assets and capacity aimed at enabling it to respond more quickly to market changes, accelerate its North American energy storage system business, and strengthen productivity and cost competitiveness in its battery operations.

The company said the restructuring is expected to improve its financial structure and profitability by sharply reducing debt and cutting fixed costs.

SK On posted an operating loss of 124.8 billion won ($84.72 million) for the July-September period, nearly double the 66.4 billion won loss in the previous quarter due to slowing EV battery shipments.

In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that electric-car sales could fall by around 50% following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for buyers.

SK On has been expanding into the energy storage system business to offset weaker EV demand. In September, the company signed a deal with U.S.-based Flatiron Energy Development to supply lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems.

Developed through extensive engagement across the entire packaging value chain, the paper outlines six key policy levers that support effective, equitable, and implementable EPR programs.

The paper reflects months of work by brands, retailers, manufacturers, recyclers, NGOs, government entities, and technical experts. It draws on a value-chain survey, a hybrid workshop on EPR fundamentals, and multiple rounds of review by U.S. Plastics Pact members (called “Activators”), whose feedback shaped the final guidance. This broad, active participation makes the points in the paper both balanced in perspective and pragmatic in design, offering a rare point of alignment for stakeholders who routinely navigate complex and often contentious EPR debates.

“There is no shortage of EPR guidance in the marketplace — but what makes this one different is the process behind it,” said Megan O’Brien, program manager for reporting and special projects at the USPP. “This paper reflects genuine consensus across stakeholders who don’t always come to the table with the same priorities. Its value is that the Pact has already navigated the hard conversations, giving policymakers a credible, balanced foundation to build from.”

The position paper identifies six policy levers — Funding Model, Funding System Design, Fee-Setting & Eco-modulation, Performance Targets, Responsible End Markets, and Covered Materials — that states can use to build structured, harmonized EPR systems while retaining flexibility to address local infrastructure, data, and market realities. Drawing on USPP’s Roadmap 2.0 and widely recognized guidance from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the paper emphasizes clear definitions, transparent and responsible end-market criteria, achievable initial requirements, and mechanisms to increase ambition over time.

“Developing the U.S. Plastics Pact’s EPR position paper was a collaborative process that brought in valuable perspectives from the public, private, and non-profit sectors on what representatives would like to see out of the future EPR programs,” said Preston Peck, Senior Sustainability Analyst with the City of Tacoma, WA. “We hope that this document can provide legislators and advocates with guidance on best practices, lessons learned, and other policy considerations from Pact members’ experience with EPR policy development and implementation across the U.S.”

“As a global packaging company, we see firsthand how fragmented approaches can hold back progress,” said Robert Flores, Vice President of Sustainability Operations and Advocacy - Americas at Amcor. “EPR works best when every part of the value chain is engaged and contributing to balanced outcomes that are sustainable long-term.”

The position paper underscores the link between supply-side EPR obligations and demand-side policies needed to strengthen postconsumer recycled content (PCR) markets — a critical element of a functioning circular system. By translating circular economy objectives into clear, consensus-built guidance, the U.S. Plastics Pact offers policymakers a practical resource for developing legislation that works in real-world conditions while maintaining long-term circularity goals.

The stories are too often the same. It’s always “China puts the whole car world into a tailspin,” or “BYD will dominate the whole world,” and “foreign brands should just throw in the towel now since there’s no chance they’ll ever catch up to China.” At the same time, a China-detractor will insist that the country’s automotive push is ill-gotten, and its sales are solely due to nationalism and artificially low labor costs.

I suppose I’m also no stranger to writing those types of stories, but I have grown weary of both of those narratives. Not that they’re necessarily wrong, but I feel like the conversation doesn’t get enough into why Chinese brands have made such inroads there and now in other places: the cars themselves.

This was readily apparent for us when we visited the Shanghai Auto Show earlier this year. Take Volkswagen: it's the original Western brand to make inroads in China, and for decades, it did extremely well there. But sit in an ID.3 and then sit in something from Nio, Xpeng, Chery or any number of homegrown brands. The Western stuff relies on leftover products often at least a generation behind, slightly rewarmed for a public these automakers assumed didn’t know much better. But now, they certainly do, and they know they can do better.

In the two years I’ve been back and forth to the People’s Republic—an eternity in Chinese car development years—it seems like some “foreign” brands are figuring out just how to compete. During my last trip to China, for Xpeng’s AI day, I skulked around both Beijing and Guangzhou in search of two cars: the Ford Bronco EREV, and the Buick Electra L7. Unfortunately, the Ford wasn’t on dealership lots quite yet. Chinese media got a special preview of the car as I was leaving the country.

But the Buick Electra L7 is there right now, though. And a quick impression in a Guangzhou dealership tells me one thing: Western brands actually do know how to make an EV (or EREV, in this case) when they want to, but you’ll never, ever see that. And that’s a damn shame.

Why The Buick Electra L7 Is So Important

Photo by: Kevin Williams/InsideEVs

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you probably know that Buick has kind of been the backbone of GM’s Chinese operations for about 20 years now. The brand officially entered China in 1997, but close ties with local automaker SAIC (via China’s then-mandatory 50/50 joint venture scheme) and early entry into a market with very immature homegrown brands saw GM gain ground pretty quickly with Buick.

For years, Buick sold localized versions of cars from the GM global portfolio, like the Buick Excelle, a really nice version of the Daewoo Lacetti. Or, perhaps you’re familiar with the Buick GL8, a Chinese version of the old Chevrolet Venture that remains a staple on its roads today. Both cars sold millions in China. The success of Buick in China is why it didn’t get the big chop in 2008, while Pontiac did.

But the idea of simply localizing global (or American) products for China isn’t quite panning out the way it once used to. Buick’s Chinese sales numbers have seen big drops, while GM itself has been losing money in China for the first time in decades. The line of global products tweaked and then sold in China just wasn’t working, even if some were electrified. For example, Buick got its own variants of the GM Ultium platform, called the Electra E4 and E5, but sales weren’t so hot.

Buick Electra E4

Buick China cut prices deeply on the E5, and even cancelled the E4 entirely. Chevrolet China was once supposed to get locally made versions of the Equinox EV and Blazer EV, but they too were killed instead. Given what I’ve seen from the competition in China, it was likely the right move.

So, GM China went back to the drawing board and came up with this: Xiao Yao.

Photo by: Buick

That’s the name for a new platform co-developed by Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center Co., GM’s engineering and design joint venture with SAIC. Unlike Ultium, which is EV only, Xiao Yao is designed to be a flexible vehicle architecture, offering PHEV, EREV, or full EV, with drive wheels that can be at either end, or both of them for AWD. In concept, it feels pretty similar to what we’ve seen in Ultium, although I’d argue that Xiao Yao lends itself to a final product that doesn’t feel so large and wide. All of the Ultium cars I’ve driven feel huge, while at least a static impression of the Electra L7 feels like a normal-sized sedan.

But the platform itself goes beyond just drive wheels and batteries. Buick leaned into China’s software and hardware ecosystem, so expect assisted driving that differs from the U.S.-market Super Cruise, and processing power straight from the now-ubiquitous Qualcomm Snapdragon line of chips. On paper, it seems like it’s ready to go toe to toe with similarly sized EV or EREV sedans from brands like Zeekr, Lynk & Co, Xpeng, and Nio.

So what exactly is the L7?

At its core, the Buick Electra L7 is an extended-range EV midsized fastback sedan about the same size as the Buick Regal from not too long ago.

Buick Electra L7

Power for the Electra L7 comes from a 338-horsepower rear-mounted motor that spins the rear wheels, fed by a 40.2 kWh battery. Since this is an EREV, there’s a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 154 horsepower. There may be plans for a full EV or dual motor AWD Electra L7, but Buick China has not confirmed the timing or specifications quite yet.

In person, I found the Electra L7 to be pleasantly handsome. I’ve not been a huge fan of Buick’s latest styling trends both in China or North America; the cars feel both too downmarket and too generic for what is supposed to be a storied American luxury brand. Buick’s crossovers just feel like nice Chevrolets with leather, almost as if GM itself is holding the brand back to make room for Cadillac.

Yet the Electra L7 is a stunner by comparison. It feels like the first iteration of Buick’s new styling themes that feel coherent and upscale. The L7’s proportions are smooth, whereas the Ultium cars sometimes look like they’re going out of their way to hide a huge and thick battery. This car’s low-slung body looks downright svelte by comparison. The proportions are slick, the hood is long, but not overly so. There’s enough bright work on the body to look more elevated compared to a non-luxury oriented car, but not so much to the point where the car would feel comfortable parking front row in the parking lot of a nursing home.

The real story is the interior. It’s so much improved from what I’ve experienced on Chinese-market Buicks. I’ve been in the back seats of cars like the old GL8 van (which still used the U-body Venture chassis until about 2019), or the PHEV or EV version of the Velite 6 station wagon. It’s all hard, rough, and loud. The first time I went to China, I wondered why GM didn’t sell cars like the Buick Velite 6 or Chevy Menlo in the United States. Within five minutes of seat time of any of Buick’s China-only specials, I learned how low-quality and unpleasant they are.

But the Electra L7 felt like GM, or at least SAIC-GM, had taken those comments to heart. See, it feels like China’s mid-tier and premium sedans have kind of all fallen into a similar level of interior quality and expected accoutrements for passengers. Sit in the back of an Xpeng P7+ or Lynk & Co 07, and you’ll realize there isn't a single Chinese-market car (whether ICE or electrified) that isn’t overwhelmingly soft to the touch in its rear quarters. Everything is padded, and adjustable, a far cry from the Velite 6es I’d ridden in the back of as rideshare cars. The Electra L7 finally joins the ranks of China’s best.

Really, it’s overwhelming how downright sumptuous the L7’s interior is. Of course, the unit on display in the dealership was a top trim Avenir model, so this car had every option on the sheet equipped. Still, every single touchpoint was covered in soft and padded leather or vinyl. Both rows of seats were heated and cooled, while the cabin was incredibly quiet.

SAIC-GM even went out of its way to minimize the use of the standard parts bucket options of GM’s switches and knobs; the only familiar thing to me was the turn signal stalk. Everything else felt new, expensive, and well-weighted. Add in the super snappy China-specific infotainment software, and it finally felt like I was in an American-branded car that felt like it was on par with China’s best offerings. It was even priced right, too. The L7 started at $24,000, although the top-of-the-line Avenir would be closer to $31,000. Right on target for plenty of premium line Chinese midsize sedans like the Lynk & Co Z10 or Changan SL03.

It’s a shame that I couldn’t drive it.

You Will Never Get It. Sorry.

It’s clear that SAIC-GM, either with the help of GM’s global assets or operating autonomously, knows how to build a car. The Electra L7 is one of its latest examples. Travel to Mexico or parts of Southeast Asia and you’ll see plenty of “Chevrolet” badged vehicles that are actually captive imports of Chinese Wuling, Baojun or SAIC-GM vehicles sold with a familiar badge. And, it’s working. These cars are selling decently because of their strong value, affordability and perception of quality.

But we’ll likely never get it. The Xiao Yao’s batteries and software are very much intertwined with China’s supply chains. GM CEO Mary Barra has reportedly gone out of her way to disentangle GM’s North American supply chains from China entirely. The prospect of bringing a U.S.-localized version of the Electra L7 to the U.S. would likely take a lot of work, if it's even possible in a political climate that is actively pushing back standards on fuel economy.

And yet Electra L7’s existence proves that brands can actually compete in China, with a little work. That might mean closer ties with Chinese brands and listening to what Chinese folks actually want to buy.

The L7 is nice, but Buick isn’t the only brand that’s figuring out how to play ball. Volkswagen has gone to Xpeng for platform and software stuff for its next crop of China-oriented vehicles. Ford and JMC came up with a competitively priced Bronco EREV that, so far, has strong initial impressions among Chinese media. Toyota’s Chinese bZ--series cars sometimes share parts and development with GAC and even BYD batteries. The end results are good.

It’s a shame we won’t ever be able to experience them. But if the “foreign” automakers keep this up, they may have a decent shot at relevance.

A new survey from the National Association of Realtors found that businesses are focused on energy efficiency when purchasing or leasing commercial property. The responses came from over 2,000 realtors, more than half of whom reported that promoting a building’s energy efficiency is valuable when listing it. Similarly, a third of realtors said green building certifications increased commercial property value.

While 70% of respondents said clients found utility and operations costs to be important considerations, only 27% said clients were focused on renewable energy systems such as solar and geothermal. Even still, 35% of realtors said it was important to understand how solar panels impact a real-estate transaction. Behind-the-meter solar infrastructure that directly powers buildings can lower utility bills, as can net metering, and proper insulation prevents heat or cooling loss.

In a recent House hearing on energy efficiency, hearing witness Kara Saul Rinaldi, chief policy officer of the Building Performance Association, said that energy efficiency can guarantee building longevity and support the grid.

“Energy efficiency in buildings and appliances lowers costs for families and businesses,” Rinaldi said during the hearing. “Advancing energy efficiency across the US reduces demand on our energy system.”

Beyond lowering energy bills and aiding the grid, a new report from the Building Performance Association also found rising employment as a result of green building construction and upgrading existing structures. The energy-efficiency industry is “creating more jobs than any other energy sector” and the number of energy-efficiency jobs has “nearly doubled since 2021.” What’s more, energy efficiency is the “largest energy sector” in most states.

Although the sector continues to throw points on the board, an energy-efficiency home improvement tax credit created by the Inflation Reduction Act is about to be phased out as part of Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill. But an executive from an energy-efficient home appliance company told Tech Brew that higher energy prices will make energy-saving devices more attractive, even without the tax credits.

“A variety of actions that the administration is taking are expected to drive up prices in ways that have the potential to be pretty significant,” Michael Rigney, CEO of smart heat pump company Cala Systems, told Tech Brew over the summer. “That’s going to make the savings even bigger.

A study released this week by the Environmental Integrity Project found that 27 states have reduced budgets for their environmental agencies over the past 15 years, adjusted for inflation, and Texas was among the worst offenders.

The Lone Star State is among seven that have axed a third or more of their funding for environmental oversight. Indeed, the 33% funding reduction for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality was the nation’s seventh-largest. Lawmakers whittled the agency’s budget from $615 million in 2010 to just $413 million last fiscal year.

Texas also was among the two-thirds of states — 31 to be exact — that also took an ax to staffing for their environmental agencies. Those states eliminated 3,725 positions, or about 13 percent of total jobs, over the past 15 years. TCEQ faced a 2% force reduction over that time period.

“These deep reductions mean that the Trump Administration’s proposed downsizing of the EPA would have an increased impact on pollution control efforts across the country,” the study’s authors wrote. “Not only will the federal pollution cop no longer be on the beat, state authorities may not show up either.”

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal would cut the EPA’s funding by 55%, or $4.2 billion, according to the report. House Republicans have recommended slashing it by a quarter, while the Senate Appropriations Committee voted for a 5% decrease.

Amid such a federal downsizing, many states won’t be able to take on more environmental oversight responsibilities because years of budget cuts have effectively neutered their ability to manage pollution, according to EIP’s study.

Calling out the Lone Star State

While Texas isn’t alone in slashing away at its environmental protection agency, the state’s actions warrant special attention because of its brisk growth and its large concentration of polluters, according to the report.

To that point, EIP created a special case study on the state in its report. The environmental group called out Texas for:

• Cutting TCEQ’s budget at a time when the number of companies requiring air pollution expanded by 15% statewide.

• Allowing such a high turnover rate at TCEQ that, last year, 30% of its workforce had less than two years’ experience and half had less than five years’ experience.

• Enabling TCEQ — which is led by three appointees of Gov. Greg Abbott — to operate as “reluctant regulators” who encourage polluters to “self-govern and self-police,” as described in one of the state’s own reports.

In EIP’s analysis, Annalisa Peace, executive director of the Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance, warns that Texas’ environmental regulators don’t receive the necessary support from agency leaders to carry out their work.

“They do have a lot of people who want to do good, but [the leaders] make it very hard on them,” said Peace, who’s observed the TCEQ for roughly three decades.

If the U.S. continues to resist carbon price, we are choosing to surrender our hard-won industrial advantage.","For decades, American industry has held a quiet, underappreciated competitive advantage: On a per-unit basis, much of our heavy manufacturing — steel, aluminum, cement — is cleaner and more carbon-efficient than many of our major international rivals’. This “carbon advantage” is a powerful tool, reflecting years of technology shifts and strict local environmental regulation. But this position of leadership is fragile, and the United States risks forfeiting it entirely if we continue to ignore the global momentum toward pricing carbon. A new initiative launched at the recent COP30 makes this threat immediate and undeniable.

The new global carbon alignment

At COP30, held in Belém, Brazil, in November 2025, a group of nations formally launched the Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets (the coalition), a voluntary initiative that strengthens environmental integrity by encouraging experiences-sharing. It is focused on aligning domestic carbon-pricing systems, harmonizing Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) protocols, standardizing accounting rules, and exploring long-term market interoperability. In short, the world’s major economies are taking concrete steps toward creating a unified, predictable global price signal for carbon.

The idea is rooted in rigorous policy research, building on work from the Global Climate Policy Project (GCPP) at Harvard and MIT. The GCPP’s September 2025 report outlined the potential: A voluntary coalition of nations coordinating on robust carbon-price floors could significantly cut global emissions; raise trillions in revenue for emissions-reduction and adaptation efforts; and, critically, prevent a chaotic and economically destabilizing patchwork of unilateral border measures. The coalition essentially serves as the technical and political engine for realizing the carbon-priced future the report envisioned.

During COP30, a diverse set of countries joined the new coalition. The ranks now consist of Brazil, China, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Chile, Germany, Mexico, Armenia, Zambia, France, Rwanda, Andorra, Guinea, New Zealand, Monaco, Singapore, and Norway. Seven of the countries in this group account for more than two-thirds of total U.S. goods exports. They’re now working together to implement mandatory carbon pricing frameworks, incentivizing emission reduction domestically and providing a competitive edge when facing border charges on exports.

The fragility of the American advantage

The implications for U.S. energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries are staggering. Analyses from our own work and from groups such as the Climate Leadership Council have consistently shown that U.S. heavy industry is, for the moment, among the least carbon-intensive in the world. In steel, chemicals, glass, and cement, for example, the carbon intensity of U.S. production is among the lowest in the world. This is partly the result of cleaner electricity supply relative to competitors, and partly the result of relatively modern industrial facilities.

But this leadership is fragile. As countries in the Open Coalition implement carbon pricing, they create two reinforcing incentives: first, for their domestic firms to accelerate investments in clean industrial technologies; and second, for their governments to implement Border Carbon Adjustments (BCAs) to protect those firms from dirtier imports. Firms in those jurisdictions will begin to benefit from a combination of carbon cost signals and financial support that reward cleaner production.

The carbon cost signal to the U.S. would also be clear: If the U.S. does not adopt policies that provide similar incentives, the carbon advantage that currently benefits U.S. exporters could narrow or even disappear.

What makes this situation even more alarming — and arguably more likely — is that this global acceleration toward lower emissions comes as U.S. policy moves aggressively in the opposite direction. The Trump administration, for instance, aims to extend the life of coal-fired power plants. A recently signed executive order defines coal as a critical mineral and proposes to repeal power plant regulations like the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards and Carbon Pollution Standards. The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy are even looking into using backup diesel generators to meet high energy demand.

These actions, by diminishing the costs of polluting, jeopardize the health of both adjacent communities and downwind states, while weakening America’s industrial-carbon advantage. As other countries increase their decarbonization efforts, U.S. policies are widening the gap, making our energy grid — and the production that relies on it — more emission-intensive and more vulnerable to trade penalties.

Understanding where plants are most vulnerable and which new tools and practices are helping remains essential as the industry braces for deeper electrification, rising load and increasingly erratic winter weather.
Top Winter Problem Areas Across North American thermal plants, EPRI sees the same winter trouble spots repeat year after year.
That has been changing since NERC introduced the EOP-012 cold weather standard.
NERC recently reported early progress in its first annual Cold Weather Data and Analysis report, submitted in October.","Are U.S. power generation owner-operators getting better at winterization and freeze protection? According to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the answer is yes, and not by a small margin.

“Anything that you focus on like that is going to result in improvements,” said Brad Burns, program area manager for Fleet Management and Operations at EPRI.

Burns oversees research in integrated asset management, plant management essentials and cycle chemistry, three areas deeply tied to practical O&M and seasonal readiness. He said owner-operators are now taking winter preparedness more seriously after several years of severe cold events exposed long-standing weaknesses in instrumentation, insulation and plant procedures.

The improvements are measurable. Plants are investing in more structured work management processes, more frequent walkdowns and more robust engineering reviews. New technologies are entering the field. And the strong push from NERC’s cold-weather standard is forcing changes that would not have happened on their own.

But while progress is real, Burns said the job is far from complete. Understanding where plants are most vulnerable and which new tools and practices are helping remains essential as the industry braces for deeper electrification, rising load and increasingly erratic winter weather.

Top Winter Problem Areas

Across North American thermal plants, EPRI sees the same winter trouble spots repeat year after year.

“Sensing lines and instrumentation is probably the biggest one,” Burns said. These small-diameter impulse lines operate in low- or no-flow conditions, making them extremely vulnerable to freezing. Once they freeze, the consequences can be immediate.

“You can’t continue to fire a boiler without drum level. If it sees that there’s no drum level as a false indication, because the sensing line froze, guess what? Unit trip, you’re offline,” Burns said. “And it’s very difficult to get units back online in cold weather.”

Problems almost always trace back to poor insulation and heat-tracing: missing or damaged insulation, improperly installed heat-trace systems, or systems that were never sized correctly in the first place.

Cooling systems also suffer when temperatures drop. Burns cited icing in cooling towers, cooling water intakes and service-water systems, particularly when a cooling-tower cell is taken out of service and freezes solid.

Fuel and material handling add another layer of risk. Coal and limestone systems can freeze, diesel fuel can gel, and natural-gas curtailments during extreme cold create operational constraints even if equipment itself remains functional. Burns noted that more plants are moving to dual-fuel capability to maintain reliability when gas supply tightens.

Even human mobility becomes an operational constraint. Some plants require tire chains, traction gear or specialized cold-weather PPE simply to allow operators to move safely around the site and perform routine duties.

What Went Wrong During Uri/Elliott – And Why It’s Changing

During Winter Storms Uri and Elliott, heat trace systems often failed because they had never been tested under real extreme-cold conditions.

“Of course they test their systems to make sure they’re functional, but not under full load, maximum cold conditions,” said Burns.

In many cases, the only indicator of whether heat trace was functioning was a single LED light — not a true assessment of whether circuits could hold full load without tripping.

“They didn’t have any sophistication in those systems,” said Burns.

He noted that plant management was also reluctant to spend on freeze protection unless they had no choice.

“Let’s be honest here, power plants are not going to spend money on freeze protection systems when they need other critical equipment,” Burns said.

That has been changing since NERC introduced the EOP-012 cold weather standard. The rule requires owner-operators to establish cold-weather preparedness plans, perform seasonal readiness tasks, document deficiencies and prove their units can operate in extreme cold conditions.

As Burns put it, “It forced them to do it.”

The standard has led to improved CMMS usage, pre-season walkdowns, checklist discipline and engineering analyses of winter performance. NERC recently reported early progress in its first annual Cold Weather Data and Analysis report, submitted in October.

Newer Technologies EPRI Sees in the Field

While administrative improvements are important, several notable technologies are emerging that directly reduce winter risk.

One is the growing use of instrument enclosures with real-time monitoring. Instead of relying on spot checks, operators can verify heat-trace performance and enclosure temperatures from the control room.

“Having enclosures for your sensing lines, and having those enclosures monitored in real-time with temperature and things like that, that’s a whole technology that’s emerging,” Burns said.

Another trend is the adoption of guided-wave radar (GWR) for drum-level measurement, particularly in HRSGs with triple-pressure drums exposed to the elements.

“It’s basically a device that’s mounted on a chamber,” Burns said. “It sends low-energy pulses down a probe that’s reflected back up to the device, and it detects the drum level without use of sensing lines.”

These changes align with what Emerson is seeing across the industry. Marty McDonough, senior business development manager for the company’s power business, said utilities are adopting wireless temperature monitoring, acoustic sensors and non-intrusive flow meters at a pace that would have been unlikely a decade ago.

“Once you have a wireless system, then it’s easy to add monitoring points,” McDonough said. “It’s very cost advantageous once the gateways and the system are in.”

Emerson is also seeing structural changes in how drum-level measurement is specified. Historically, GWR was more of a brownfield upgrade. Today, McDonough said HRSG OEMs themselves are requesting it on new projects.

“We actually have the HRSG OEMs coming to us from the experiences of the end user, saying, ‘Hey, we want guided-wave radar here. We don’t want to do wet legs and impulse lines anymore,’” he said.

But despite regulatory pressure and technological progress, Burns noted that budgets remain tight.

“Most plants in the U.S. and North America nowadays, they’re just not swimming in cash,” he said. “They’re being forced to look at every dollar they spend, and those dollars are not going to go towards cold weather preparedness, unless they feel like it’s a real reliability risk or a compliance risk.”

But industry experts say attitudes about cold weather reliability are changing. Severe cold events have forced utilities — particularly in the South — to make winterization upgrades. McDonough said these regions are now among the most proactive in pursuing new monitoring, eliminating freeze-prone wet legs and upgrading heat-trace verification systems.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc-pp-hrsg-winter-storm-uri.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 12:05:24.844778

By Rebecca Williams, Managing Director, Rockefeller Group Foreign Trade Zone Services and Eric Dalby, VP Support, Professional Services at Descartes","In 1934, when Congress passed the Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) Act and established the FTZ program, the U.S. economy faced a policy environment similar to today’s: high (and prevalent) tariffs and heightened concern for protecting domestic industries and encouraging domestic investment. Then, as now, policymakers sought mechanisms to help U.S.-based companies stay competitive in the face of escalating costs by offsetting the burden of high tariffs.

For decades, FTZs have been used actively and on trend with overall U.S. import and export statistics, providing importers, exporters, and manufacturers with a toolkit to manage customs duties, streamline operations and bolster cash flow. Today, however, recent tariff actions on steel and aluminum that for most countries doubled to 50% under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as well as sweeping International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) reciprocal tariffs imposed on nearly all commodities from all countries, have upended global trade and shifted the FTZ landscape significantly.

As trade tensions push import duties to record highs, companies big and small are looking for ways to insulate themselves against tariff volatility and stabilize cash flow against economic uncertainty. While FTZs are resonating as a strategy to mitigate or avoid absorbing higher tariffs into operating costs, the program is not a silver bullet. Instead, FTZ participation in 2025 demands a more nuanced cost-benefit analysis that weighs the traditional advantages of FTZs compared to the current benefits against changing trade policy.

Traditional FTZ Benefits

Licensed by the U.S. FTZ Board, FTZs are secure, designated sites traditionally located within 60 miles or a 90-minute drive from a U.S. port of entry (although FTZ sites now are often located at further points as well), in which domestic and foreign merchandise (i.e., inventory) receives the same treatment by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as if it were outside the commerce of the United States. FTZs enable companies to defer, reduce or eliminate duties, depending on where goods end up (e.g., distributed domestically or exported to avoid applicable duties and taxes).

Historically, one of the most important FTZ benefits was inverted tariff relief for manufacturers. Through the Boggs Amendment of 1950 and regulatory clarifications in the 1980s, U.S. manufacturers could import higher-duty inputs, process them domestically, and release finished products into the commerce of the U.S. at lower duty rates of the finished products. This helped manufacturers reduce overall tariff costs, enhance profitability and get on more even footing with offshore manufacturers.

Put another way, it gave U.S.-based businesses federal approval to rationalize what historically was “irrational tariff treatment” in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the U.S. (HTSUS). Irrational tariff treatment is when imported parts and materials are assessed at higher duty rates than the finished goods they are incorporated into. Without the ability to invert duty rates, companies would be financially incentivized, from a customs duty treatment perspective, to import finished goods rather than produce them domestically.

Beyond inverted tariffs, FTZs offer additional benefits:

Export relief: Goods brought in and stored or manufactured in an FTZ can be exported in bond without incurring quota charges or U.S. duties, insulating businesses from the adverse effects of tariff hikes. Plus, merchandise exported from FTZs to international customers and subsequently returned can be admitted to an FTZ for storage, repair and export again without being subject to duties.

Cash-flow benefits: The timing of when duties are paid makes a significant difference to cash flow. By deferring the payment of duties until goods leave an FTZ, companies improve working capital. By bringing the duty cost closer to when goods are sold to the customer, companies can shorten the cash cycle and optimize cash flow. Depending on how fast a business turns its inventory, this can be a critical part of a company’s ability to maintain its U.S. operations.

Weekly customs entry and Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF) savings: MPF is paid per customs entry (.3464% against the value reported on the entry) but has a maximum amount today of $651.50 with routine incremental increases each year. However, FTZs permit qualified companies to consolidate an entire week’s worth of shipments out of the FTZ into a single weekly customs entry, thereby creating the opportunity to possibly save broker entry fees and significantly reduce annual MPF spend. Filing consolidated weekly entries is especially appealing for high-volume importers but comes with its own set of complexities in the current trade policy environment.

State and local tax savings: In states that assess ad valorem tax on inventory, such as Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Puerto Rico, inventory held in FTZs may be preempted from such taxes through the federal FTZ law. Likewise, some states have codified state-level tax benefits, such as Arizona’s reduction of up to 75% for real and personal property held in FTZs. These tax exemptions and reductions—above and beyond the traditional duty benefits of the program—create additional financial incentives and help further reduce operational costs for FTZ users.

A Changing Trade Landscape

For decades, these advantages attracted a diverse mix of manufacturers and distributors into the program. In 2018, however, key tariff developments began to disrupt the global trade landscape. In January 2018, the U.S. imposed safeguard tariffs on solar panels and washing machines from all sources (except Canada) under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. In March 2018, Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum took effect, with temporary exemptions for Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea and the EU. By June, however, exemptions had expired for Canada, Mexico and the EU, and Section 232 tariffs were imposed.

In April 2018, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) released a list of 1,333 China-origin imports for proposed 25% Section 301 duties, as part of a broader and new trading strategy with the East Asian nation. Within days, China imposed retaliatory tariffs of its own on U.S. exports. By June, the USTR proposed a new list of products from China, worth $50 billion in trade, to be subject to Section 301 duties of 25%. These initial trade remedy actions in 2018 were just the beginning of what is now an almost eight-year-long, increasingly complicated but fundamental change in U.S. trade policy.

Interestingly, with the first six months of 2018 also came a pivotal shift in how FTZs function today: a change to mandating the election of Privileged Foreign (PF) status for imported merchandise at the time of admission to an FTZ, which locks in an item’s classification and duty rate on that date. For decades, imported raw materials, components and finished goods were largely admitted into FTZs in Non-privileged Foreign (NPF) status, which requires classification on the item’s condition as removed from the FTZ at the duty rate in effect on the date of entry. For FTZ manufacturers authorized by the U.S. Department of Commerce, NPF status elected for imported parts and components is what drove inverted tariff benefit (i.e., the ability to apply the finished good duty rate to the value of the parts/components consumed in the finished good). With 2018’s new tariff actions, the Administration through the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Commerce began requiring FTZ imports to be admitted in PF status. PF status “locks in” the normal, or Most Favored Nation (MFN), duties and any remedy tariff rates on goods at the time of their admission into an FTZ, which means the imported component’s duty and tariff rates apply even if the finished good made in the FTZ carries a lower duty rate.

What does this mean in practical terms? It means the inverted tariff benefit for FTZ manufacturers was essentially eliminated in April of this year when the PF status admission stipulation began applying to nearly all imported commodities from all countries of origin via IEEPA reciprocal tariffs. Now, existing FTZ manufacturers as well as manufacturers considering the program must recalculate the savings opportunities from FTZ usage. For some manufacturers, the program may continue to make sense or drive even more benefit, while for others the program may no longer make sense. Paradoxically, tariffs intended to protect U.S. jobs are simultaneously hampering some FTZ manufacturers from promoting domestic production, the original intent of the program. If the same finished product is made in another country, under IEEPA reciprocal tariffs, it still offers a lower overall tariff rate when imported than the imported parts and components used to make the finished product in the U.S. If the goal of current trade policy, however, is to reshore and nearshore manufacturing, don’t FTZ manufacturers still need the inverted tariff benefit to rationalize what is otherwise still an irrational HTSUS?

FTZ Advantages Today

What are the main advantages for FTZ users today then? For many importers, it’s cash flow: by delaying duty payments, companies can preserve capital. This benefit, however, depends heavily on inventory turnover. Large retailers cross-docking goods through distribution centers may realize little advantage as goods enter U.S. commerce within days, triggering prompt duty payments. By contrast, businesses holding inventory for weeks or months can extract more meaningful benefit from duty deferral, such as industrial distributors, seasonal retailers, or exporters awaiting foreign buyers.

In the absence of inverted tariffs, the importance of export relief has grown. Manufacturers that ship even a portion of their production abroad can typically eliminate duties altogether on exported goods. For many businesses that traditionally relied on inverted tariffs, this now represents one of the few clear savings opportunities. Additionally, some manufacturers that previously had little reason to consider FTZs are now compelled to join the program precisely to avoid duties on outbound shipments.

While tariff relief is the focus for many, ancillary benefits remain material. Although now more administratively complex, weekly entry/MPF savings continue to appeal to some while the compliance requirements may outweigh the fee savings for others. Inventory and real/personal property tax abatements are still available in states such as Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Arizona and Puerto Rico, but these benefits are not guaranteed. They require negotiation with local impacted tax recipients and cannot be assumed across the board. Companies that install imported production equipment in their FTZ production facilities can also achieve duty/tariff deferral benefits on the machinery until it begins being using in production.

Looking Ahead: Uncertainty and Opportunity

The FTZ program is at a crossroads. Its historical role as an engine for tariff rationalization for U.S. manufacturers has been curtailed, but its potential as a platform for cash flow management, export relief and targeted ancillary tax savings is legitimate. In addition, pending litigation, including possible Supreme Court rulings, could dramatically reshape the tariff landscape overnight. A rollback of tariffs could potentially restore inverted tariff benefits for many industries and commodities, while new tariff exemption frameworks could offer parallel relief.

For importers and manufacturers, the shift in trade policy has forced more sophisticated supply chain analyses. Establishing and operating an FTZ requires significant time and investment in an extremely complex trade compliance environment. Understanding if setting up and operating an FTZ makes sense in the context of this complexity is not a simple exercise. For tax and finance professionals, determining whether FTZ participation will yield measurable benefit requires a more granular assessment of inventory turn rates and export volumes. Companies must model turnover rates, tariff exposures, and compliance costs in detail to decide whether an FTZ is advantageous for the organization’s unique product mix, trade patterns, and risk tolerance.

Parting Thoughts

For businesses, agility is critical. Companies must reassess FTZ participation regularly, model cash flow implications under various scenarios, and assess measures for ancillary benefits, including engaging with local authorities on property and inventory tax opportunities where appropriate.

For policymakers grappling with the challenge of reconciling tariff policy with industrial strategy, FTZs may represent an underused tool. In an era when tariff policies are used both as protectionist levers and geopolitical instruments, FTZs provide a stable, regulated framework for balancing trade governance with competitiveness.

FTZs are not loopholes. They are highly regulated, overseen by U.S. CBP and the Department of Commerce, and subject to annual reviews and public interest considerations for manufacturers. In many ways, they are better suited to provide equitable tariff mitigation than ad hoc exemption processes. A 2019 econometric study conducted by The Trade Partnership titled The U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones Program: Economic Benefits to American Communities quantified that—all else being equal—employment, wages, and value-added activity are higher in areas with FTZs than similar areas without FTZs, and that a company’s access to FTZ benefits has substantial positive ripple effects throughout its U.S. supply chain.

And so, as they were conceived, FTZs are an effective mechanism for encouraging domestic manufacturing and facilitating global competitiveness.

Congressman Lou Correa introduced the Design for Recycling Resolution (“Resolution”) that is described as recognizing and encouraging:

… efforts by manufacturers to reduce waste and consumption of raw materials by designing products to maximize their recyclability.

The Resolution is described as recognizing the recycling industry’s contributions to the United States economy and the environment, through:

Jobs created.

Revenue and taxes generated.

Recovery of goods (including rare earth materials).

The Resolution describes “design for recycling” (“DFR”) as a:

… method of designing products to ensure they are made from recycled material, are free of hazardous materials that may impede the recycling process, and can be easily recycled through current or newly designed recycling processes and procedures after the end of their life in a cost-effective manner.

The Resolution argues that DFR would:

Reduce the amount of waste that ending up in landfills.

Reduce greenhouse gases.

Reduce consumption of raw materials.

Recycling materials industry annually contributes nearly $170 billion to the United States economy.

According to the Recycled Materials Association:

Generates $7,160,000,000 in State and local tax revenues.

Provides nearly 600,000 jobs in the United States both directly and indirectly.

In 2022, the recycled materials industry recycled over 137,000,000 metric tons of materials.

According to calculations from the Waste Reduction Model, Version 16, of the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), using recycled materials in manufacturing reduces energy consumption by up to 90 percent.

EPA estimates that about 75 percent of waste is recyclable, but only 35 percent of that is actually recycled.

Americans generated more than 267,000,000 tons of solid waste in 2020.

Container and fiberglass industries collectively purchase 3,350,000 tons of recycled glass annually, which is remelted and repurposed for use in the production of new containers and fiberglass products.

75 percent of global plastics produced are thermoplastics that can be melted and molded over and over to produce new plastics.

Only 20 percent of the polyethylene terephthalate, high-density polyethylene, and polypropylene plastics in circulation in the United States are recycled.

United States generates about 6,900,000 tons of e-waste but only recycles around 25 percent.

E-waste has hazardous chemicals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic that can require special disposal methods.

Recycling e-waste is a sustainable way to recover rare earth materials.

American Forest and Paper Association nearly 60 percent more paper products are recycled today than in 1990.

The Recycling Partnership states that additional investment in recycling will create 200,000 new jobs.

Material journey mapping can help companies succeed at DFR.

California Redemption Value program incentivizes consumers through the free market to return their cans and bottles to a recycling center.

The circular economy is a system where products and materials are kept in circulation through processes like maintenance, reuse, recycling, and composting.

Companies that assist manufacturers to embrace a circular approach through their eco-design and sustainable sourcing models.

Using local resources in manufacturing and understanding locally available resources can promote circularity.

Product life extension means keeping material and products in the supply chain for as long as possible.

Dematerialization is a strategy to minimize the use of raw materials and energy in product creation while maintaining the products quality.

Collection of recycling data by CalRecycle is critical to helping manufacturers design packaging for recyclability.

DFR would encourage manufacturers of goods to ensure their products are made of recycled material and fully recyclable.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 16:05:38.510731

“Nowadays, without being able to afford hunting, a lot of that’s been taken away.” As for impacts on fish and caribou, Pattee believes mining safeguards work.","Ambler, Alaska — Ice blocks drift past Tristen Pattee’s boat as he scans the banks of Northwest Alaska’s Kobuk River for caribou. His great uncle Ernest steadies a rifle on his lap. It’s the last day of September, and by every measure of history and memory, thousands should have crossed by now. But the tundra is empty, save for the mountains looming on the horizon — the Gates of the Arctic National Park.

Days after Pattee’s unsuccessful hunt, the Trump administration approved construction of the Ambler Access Road — a 211-mile (340-kilometer) route designed to reach massive copper deposits that would cut through that wilderness, crossing 11 major rivers and thousands of streams where salmon spawn and caribou migrate. The approval, which is facing lawsuits though proponents believe construction could start next year, came as record rainfall in Northwest Alaska flooded villages and ripped through fish spawning habitat — the latest climate-driven blow to Indigenous communities already watching caribou and salmon numbers plummet.

As the co-owner of a wilderness guiding company in Ambler, Pattee’s livelihood depends on keeping this landscape intact. An Inupiaq hunter, his ability to feed his family and continue the subsistence traditions of his ancestors depends on healthy caribou and fish populations.

Yet he supports building the road.

“Everything takes money nowadays,” said Pattee, who serves on Northwest Arctic Subsistence Regional Advisory Council, a federal advisory group. Jobs in local villages are scarce, and with gasoline at $17.50 a gallon, the ability to power all-terrain vehicles and boats needed to hunt is out of reach for many. Pattee estimates a single caribou hunting trip from Ambler costs $400. Mining jobs, he believes, would offer a lifeline, and the minerals could slow the climate shifts that are threatening his subsistence way of life.

It’s the irony of climate change in Northwest Alaska: the minerals needed to power the green energy transition sit beneath some of the continent’s last pristine wilderness — a landscape already on the frontlines of the climate crisis, where temperatures are rising four times faster than the rest of the planet.

“I see the climate changing. I’ve been seeing it for years now. It’s scary,” said Pattee. “Losing our culture, our tradition, is very concerning. So let’s do anything we can to help mitigate it.”

The decline before the road

Over the last two decades, the Western Arctic Caribou Herd has plummeted from nearly half a million to some 164,000 — a 66% decline, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Of those that remain, fewer now cross the Kobuk River during fall migration, where Pattee and other Inupiaq hunters would historically gather in late summer to stockpile meat for winter. While caribou populations naturally fluctuate, scientists say the increasingly delayed cold and snow that triggers the migration south has caused caribou to remain in the Brooks Range, where they are difficult for hunters to access.

The day after Pattee’s unsuccessful hunt, the first snow fell. On Oct. 6 — far later than historical norms — caribou began trickling across the Kobuk. Then the rains came, bringing heavy, late-season downpours that scientists say are becoming more common in the warming Arctic and devastating for salmon. Intense rainfall can damage and dislodge eggs, while rising water temperatures reduce oxygen levels fish need to journey upstream.

One recent study found dozens of clear streams in the Brooks Range have turned orange with toxic levels of metals — changes researchers believe is the result of permafrost thaw — which may help explain recent drops in salmon numbers. Chinook and chum salmon in particular are experiencing “sustained and dramatic declines” with periodic population crashes, which has led to complete closures of some fisheries, according to NOAA Fisheries.

Experts worry about what this year’s record storms will mean for future runs.

“Elders who’ve lived here their entire lives have never seen environmental conditions like this and they’ve never seen fish conditions this poor,” said Alex Whiting, Environmental Program Director for the Native Village of Kotzebue.

Adding pressure to a buckling landscape

The Ambler Road would add its own pressures. Thousands of culverts and nearly 50 bridges would disrupt water flow and fish passages, and more than 100 trucks would traverse the road daily over the decades-long production period. Federal biologists warn the region’s rocks contain naturally occurring asbestos and that heavy traffic would kick up dust that would settle on thousands of waterways as well as the vegetation caribou depend on. The road would also fragment the habitat of the Western Arctic Caribou Herd, potentially hindering migration patterns. The Bureau of Land Management designated some 1.2 million acres of nearby salmon spawning and caribou calving habitat as “critical environmental concern.”

Then there’s the mine. Vast amounts of water would be drawn from rivers and lakes, while groundwater levels and permafrost would be permanently disrupted. The operation would generate enormous quantities of waste rock and require a tailings facility to store toxic slurry, risking spills that could send heavy metals into waterways.

Given the record-breaking rainfall the region has seen in recent years, residents downstream worry about breaches. In Kotzebue, a hub of 3,000 at the mouth of the Kobuk where flooding prompted an emergency declaration this fall, many fear contamination could harm drinking sources and traditional Inupiaq foods like fish and bearded seals, which are already threatened by disappearing sea ice.

Poop ""rolls downhill — and that’s where Kotzebue’s at,” said Karmen Monigold, an Inupiaq member of Protect the Kobuk, a grassroots effort working to stop the road, and co-chair of the Kotzebue Sound Subsistence Advisory Council.

Monigold learned to live off the land as a child from her grandparents. Determined to share her connection to nature, she taught her four sons and their cousins to hunt and fish. She’s watched climate change erode the subsistence lifestyle she fought to preserve and fears the road would accelerate that loss.

Like many opponents, she doubts promises that the road would remain private and notes other Alaska roads, such as the Dalton Highway, opened to the public despite similar assurances. An influx of outside hunters and fishers, they fear, would further stress fish and caribou populations. Even Pattee’s support for the road hinges on it being closed.

“We lose so much every generation,” Monigold said. “But right now we still have enough of a culture for it to be worth fighting for.”

In an emailed statement, Kaleb Froehlich, Managing Director of Ambler Metals, the company behind the mining project, said the operation would use proven safety controls for permafrost and will treat all water from the mining process to strict standards. The company also tracks precipitation to size facilities for heavier rainfall and has a binding agreement with NANA, an Alaska Native corporation, to prioritize recruitment from nearby communities.

Ambler Metals declined to comment on concerns specific to the road, including naturally occurring asbestos, traffic impacts, public access and habitat fragmentation, noting the company is not the road developer, though it has contributed to pre-development costs and would be its primary user. The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, the state-owned investment bank developing the road, did not respond to a request for comment.

The carbon footprint of decarbonizing

Critical minerals are becoming increasingly vital — growing demand for green energy technologies could scale production by nearly 500% by 2050, according to a 2020 World Bank report. The Arctic deposit would yield not just copper, but also zinc, lead, silver and gold. At an estimated 46.7 million tons of mineral reserves, it ranks among the largest undeveloped polymetallic deposits in North America.

But there’s no guarantee the minerals would fuel clean energy. President Donald Trump has spoken openly about his disdain for electric vehicles and wind power, and the majority of copper in the U.S. goes to construction projects, according to the Copper Development Association.

The Trump administration has framed the issue as one of national security and deemed reliance on “hostile foreign powers’ mineral production” an acute threat. In March, the White House issued an executive order instructing the Secretary of the Interior to prioritize mineral production and mining as the primary land use on all federal lands known to hold mineral deposits.

Yet even that argument doesn’t quite fit. While the U.S. is heavily reliant on China for some 20 different minerals, the Arctic deposit’s primary minerals — copper and zinc — are not among them, according to the 2025 USGS report. The U.S. sources 45% of its refined copper from Chile, Canada, Mexico and Peru, and 73% of its zinc from Canada and Mexico. The rest is mined domestically.

The real issue isn’t whether the minerals are needed — it’s who gets to decide, said Andrea Marston, an associate professor of geography at Rutgers University who studies mining and Indigenous rights in the Americas. Mining projects like Ambler are sometimes located on Indigenous lands, creating what she calls a false ethical dilemma: mine to save the climate, or protect the land and perpetuate warming. That framing, she argues, obscures other possibilities like investing in mass public transportation, recycling minerals that already exist and designing systems that consume less.

“You cannot justify steamrolling Indigenous lands with a kind of global story of climate change because that just ends up reiterating colonial plunder in a new way,” she said. “The starting point should be: it is their land to decide what to do with.”

A community divided

Ambler mayor Conrad Douglas recognizes the exorbitant cost of living in his village and the desperate need for jobs. But he also knows the Canadian and Australian mining companies that hold the rights to the Ambler deposits may source workers from elsewhere, and he fears what it would all do to the land.

His concerns are layered: fugitive dust, tailings runoff and a cruel cycle where increasingly heavy rains wipe out fish runs, forcing people to rely more on caribou just as the road threatens to further disrupt those herds. With gas prices already putting hunting out of reach for many families, the equation becomes impossible.

“I don’t really know how much the state of Alaska is willing to jeopardize our way of life, but the people do need jobs,” he said, dressed in a pro Ambler Road hoodie.

Douglas worked at Red Dog Mine in the early 1990s and has seen how it benefited neighboring villages with jobs and community support. But he worries the companies behind Ambler won’t take the same approach.

For Pattee, the jobs represent more than income — they would allow people to reconnect with their culture. Young Inupiaq hunters once took immense pride in providing for their families, he said.

“That was their proud moment. That was what they lived for,” he said. “Nowadays, without being able to afford hunting, a lot of that’s been taken away.”

As for impacts on fish and caribou, Pattee believes mining safeguards work. In addition to wilderness guiding, he works as an environmental technical supervisor at Red Dog Mine and has seen good practices firsthand.

Still, ""there’s always a worry,” he said.

What would be left

Nick Jans, an author who moved to Ambler in 1979, has watched the landscape transform over 46 years. When he first arrived, permafrost banks held firm against the rivers and caribou poured through by the hundreds of thousands.

The road, he argued, would deliver the final blow to a landscape already stressed by climate change.

“This isn’t about my backyard — this is about your backyard. This is the world’s backyard,” he said, his voice catching. “We have to protect something that was this planet as it was before us. Otherwise, we’re gonna lose our way. And I would say we already have.”

The night after his unsuccessful hunt, Pattee and his family gathered around a table of bowhead whale, beluga, seal and moose — a rare meal all together as relatives had flown in from Anchorage. Like many in Ambler, Pattee’s family members have left over the years to find jobs. In a village this small, each departure is felt — the population has dwindled from 320 in 2010 to some 200 today.

“We’re losing our community. We’re literally losing it,” he said. “People want to be home but they just don’t have the opportunities to keep them there.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/11/PDTN/87716273007-ap-25344585440684.jpg?crop=6294,3542,x0,y327&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-11 16:05:42.889193

December 11, 2025

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) launched the Clean Air Act Resource for Data Centers webpage to provide data center developers, local communities and Tribes with a central location for Clean Air Act (CAA)-related resources. These additional resources further two core pillars of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative—making America the artificial intelligence (AI) capital of the world and advancing cooperative federalism.

Looking exclusively through the lens of the CAA, OAR’s specific new resources provide state and private sector partners with regulatory information, guidance and technical tools that can assist with modeling, air quality permitting, and regulatory interpretations relevant for data centers and AI facility development.

This webpage and EPA’s CAA reforms provide transparency for data centers and AI development across the U.S., speeding up the ability to build data centers and the necessary backup generation. These efforts will help decrease the cost of new facilities while preserving the reliability of our electrical grid and keeping electricity rates down. This ultimately will reduce the cost-of-living for Americans who rely on data centers and AI for their daily lives—from ensuring food at the grocery store to photos on their phones.

“The global race to harness the power of artificial intelligence and build data centers is underway. President Trump’s AI Action Plan made it clear; we need to win that race and establish America as the home for of the next great technological forefront,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin. “EPA is diligently working to eliminate burdensome regulations and ensure data centers and related facilities can be built in the U.S. as we Power the Great American Comeback. Developers, local communities and Tribes will now have easy access to the tools they need to build big, beautiful data centers and AI facilities.”

“Good rulemaking and policies must be coupled with sound public knowledge regarding regulations. As EPA works to enact policy that helps make America the AI capital of the world, our new webpage provides an essential resource to those looking to understand the current regulations,” said EPA Assistant Administrator for Air Aaron Szabo. “OAR is pleased to be able to respond directly to the request from developers, local communities and Tribes who have been asking for these resources since day one. EPA is committed to following the law and helping Americans do the same.”

Many of the current CAA requirements that impact the building of data centers date back to the 1990s when the available technology was vastly different. Historically, these rules ensure companies maintain proper pollution control. However, many of these requirements have not been updated to reflect technological advancements of the 21st century. The digital revolution has ushered in new needs and new industries, which demand a holistic approach from EPA to update rules and further cooperative federalism in this rapidly growing space. As EPA continues to advance rulemaking to streamline permitting and end overly burdensome Biden-era requirements that stunted the development of data centers and AI facilities, the following tools will provide much needed guidance and clarity on the current CAA rules as developers, local communities and Tribes navigate this uncharted territory.

OAR’s webpage is broken up into the following sections:

Regulator Resources: Power sources are a major concern for planning data center and AI infrastructure. This section provides links to information on rules that apply to stationary combustion turbines and stationary engines—common sources of primary and backup power for data centers—and which are subject to various new source performance standards for certain air emissions and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants. Before building, it is important to understand the regulations in place.

Air Permitting Resources: This section houses EPA guidance documents, letters responding to permitting requests, and interpretations of permitting regulations. Understanding how EPA has handled permitting in the past based on the agency’s statutory obligations will allow those looking to develop data centers and AI facilities to see what permitting requirements they may face.

Modeling Guidance Documents: Over the years, EPA has released several modeling guidance documents and clarification memoranda that help developers show compliance with CAA air quality standards as they build. In this section, users will find EPA’s Guideline on Air Quality Models which provides models, tools, and methods to use when dealing with CAA regulatory air quality requirements and lists the agency’s preferred air quality models for use in the Prevent of Significant Deterioration (PSD) programs. There are also modeling resources to assist with permit applications and showing compliance.

In addition, and in line with EPA’s commitment to advance cooperative federalism, EPA’s OAR staff will also be available to consult with permit reviewing authorities and individual sources on a case-by-case basis. OAR will update the webpage to reflect the most up to date CAA regulations and guidance material available.

Subsequent rounds of the Texas v. BlackRock litigation hopefully will clarify that such investors need not sit on their hands as the world burns.","Texas v. BlackRock (E.D. Tex.) (BlackRock), a case in which 11 states claim that the institutional-investor defendants colluded to profit through coordinated output reductions at coal companies they partially owned, remains in its early stages, with discovery continuing through 2027. Already however, opponents of climate-risk mitigation have rushed to extract specious theories of antitrust harm from Judge Kernodle’s partial denial of the motion to dismiss (the BlackRock MTD decision).

Following procedural requirements, Judge Kernodle took as true plaintiffs’ allegations that the BlackRock defendants joined climate alliances and pursued related mitigation goals that “necessarily result in the reduction of coal output.” Judge Kernodle also found plausible plaintiffs’ allegations of antitrust harm to consumers, as reflected in rising prices during a period of decreased production by the relevant coal companies. Judge Kernodle did note that BlackRock may possess a valid defense to these allegations, stemming from long-term declines in coal consumption. But interests aligned with the BlackRock plaintiffs already have assembled a house-of-cards antitrust argument that any institutional investor factoring climate risk into its business decisions should face heightened scrutiny on routine portfolio acquisitions.

A neutral analysis of the BlackRock MTD decision does not justify imposing such legal burdens, which would hinder these investors’ capacity to compete against their climate-indifferent rivals. This post seeks to clarify: (1) why the BlackRock MTD decision remains far from proclaiming institutional investors’ every climate consideration a proven anticompetitive output reduction; and (2) why institutional investors’ “solely for investment” exemption from antitrust scrutiny still permits these investors to promote a wide range of climate-risk mitigation measures.

The Court Has Not Yet Taken Up “Weighty Economics Questions”

The BlackRock complaint contains multiple antitrust claims. The plaintiffs assert violations under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, claiming each defendant used its partial ownership of coal companies in a manner reasonably likely to reduce competition, to consumers’ detriment. Plaintiffs also assert violations under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, claiming defendants collectively agreed to coerce the coal companies’ implementation of a coordinated output reduction (reducing coal supply in order to intensify demand, raise prices, and boost profit margins). And Plaintiffs assert violations under state antitrust laws (not covered by this blog post).

Judge Kernodle’s MTD dismissal notes that the Texas complaint’s “first of its kind” allegation of a “horizontal agreement among investors to pressure competitors in another industry to reduce output” [italics in original] does not call for per se antitrust analysis (an approach which assumes the anticompetitive harms of a given activity, and only considers whether defendants engaged in that activity). Instead, the court will conduct an elaborate rule-of-reason balancing, to “divin[e] the procompetitive or anticompetitive effects” of these defendants’ business arrangements. Judge Kernodle makes clear that “weighty economics questions” remain to be resolved in later stages of litigation. Those questions will likely focus on defining an appropriate market to measure the competitive effects of defendants’ actions, determining whether plaintiffs have persuasively pinpointed how defendants’ actions harmed competition in these markets, and assessing defendants’ claims of procompetitive benefits.

Defendants Can Argue for a Broader Market Definition

To scrutinize antitrust defendants’ effects on competition, courts typically first define a particular market in which the purported harm occurred or might occur. Judge Kernodle’s MTD dismissal notes that defendants did not contest “at this stage” of litigation the plaintiffs’ proposed focus on the markets for South Powder River Basin coal, and thermal coal. Yet defendants may have good reason to contest these market definitions at subsequent stages. Consideration of a broader market (one encompassing a wide range of energy sources that satisfy the relevant consumers’ needs) could allow defendants to argue that modernization and diversification of product options in order to meet shifting economic conditions (such as mounting climate risk), have not, on balance, harmed energy consumers.

By extension, defendants might call into question the status of coal-company output decisions as a but-for cause of consumer harm, by pointing to across-the-board price increases for a diverse array of energy products. Alternately, if defendants could show that rising coal prices coincided with increased demand for substitutable energy products (such as renewable power, nuclear power, and/or natural gas), this also may weaken the plaintiffs’ claims of harm to consumers or to competition.

Defendants Can Dispute Anticompetitive Effects

The BlackRock plaintiffs will face additional challenges meeting their burden of persuasion as this case progresses. The defendants only need to poke holes in plaintiffs’ theory of harm. The defendants might start, for example, from plaintiffs’ argumentative reliance on: “different responses…exhibited by…publicly held companies…whose shares Defendants acquired and who cut their output during a period of rising prices…and…privately held companies, who raised their output.” This facile comparison between publicly and privately owned coal companies looks easily contestable.

The plaintiffs must convince the court that broader economic trends would not have prompted these same disparities between public and private coal companies’ output. But given the escalating societal concerns and conspicuous financial risks associated with an emissions-intensive energy source like coal, public companies’ greater susceptibility to reputational costs (alongside their added disclosure obligations) may incentivize such categorical differences in output. That certainly offers a simpler account than the elaborate conspiracy plaintiffs allege, in which institutional investors promised transformational clean-tech innovations, pushed for robust emissions reporting while faking their focus on climate mitigation, and cynically captured inflated profits by peddling dirty fuels.

The BlackRock plaintiffs also advance tenuous antitrust causation claims through their frequent conflations of defendants’ alleged coal-reduction, emissions-reduction, and net-zero pledges. This misapplies antitrust’s output-reduction concerns to restraints on firms’ negative externalities (greenhouse-gas byproducts), rather than on their supplying of economic goods (carbon-based energy sources). To date, Judge Kernodle has taken as true plaintiffs’ assertion that a pledge to reduce coal emissions “necessarily means cutting coal production because ‘there is no realistic path for a coal company to cut coal emissions other than by cutting production.’” Yet regardless of whether one doubts the fossil-fuel industry’s pledges of near-term clean-coal deployment, we consider it unlikely that a merits-stage court analysis would give the plaintiffs’ brusque, future-oriented pronouncement of “no realistic path” much factual weight in proving present market harms. We likewise find it ironic that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has signed off (both as a licensed attorney, and as an accountable public official) not only on this sweeping denial of clean-coal boosterism, but also on a recent letter celebrating President Trump’s “BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL” [capitalization in original] agenda.

Nor do AG Paxton’s questionable claims stop there. In fact, the BlackRock complaint comes closest to demonstrating an agreement to reduce coal output (rather than to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions) by repeatedly misrepresenting plaintiffs’ own evidence on this topic. For but one example, the complaint brazenly cherry-picks from a Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) document, so that NZAM appears to call on its members (including each BlackRock defendant) to “immediately ceas[e] all financial or other support to coal companies…building new coal infrastructure.” Yet plaintiffs fail to disclose that the cited NZAM document does not require this particular approach. The approach is one of five climate-mitigation strategies that NZAM signatories are expected to choose from (other options include a “phase out” of thermal-coal investments on an unspecified timeline, or “restricting financing for unabated coal power generation, i.e. without carbon capture and storage”).

Judge Kernodle’s MTD decision, in turn, cites this NZAM quotation in multiple passages, at times reading it as an express NZAM requirement, rather than as a nonbinding option. Later stages of litigation will allow defendants to question whether membership in a climate alliance that permits an open-ended “phase out” of coal investments has evidentiary value in a lawsuit claiming real-world market effects between 2019 and 2022—and whether plaintiffs established that evidence in bad faith.

Former Congressmember (and ranking Republican on the House of Representatives’ Antitrust Subcommittee) Ken Buck has catalogued further ways in which “the facts dispute the allegations,” including: no relevant coal-company manager being removed by proxy vote during the complaint’s timeframe; certain defendants never voting against a single director; and purportedly colluding defendants consistently voting differently from each other.

Defendants Can Show Procompetitive Benefits

Should plaintiffs navigate these impediments to presenting a persuasive causal chain that culminates in anticompetitive effects, they still will need to address defendants’ procompetitive defenses. Multiple procompetitive rationales for corporate climate pledges present themselves, particularly for pledges to reduce emissions. To begin with, given regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. on coal emissions, as well as increasingly strict greenhouse-gas regimes in other advanced economies, reducing industry emissions (especially through lower emissions intensity) may facilitate continued coal production, under whatever constraints the industry finds itself facing. Moreover, the net-zero commitments in this case’s climate pledges need not even commit a signatory to reduced coal emissions (let alone reduced coal output), since by definition “net-zero” calculations balance GHG additions to, and removals from, the atmosphere (with possibilities for offsets).

Defendants also may argue that collective emissions pledges improve the quality of each investor firm’s offerings, and follow antitrust law on standard-setting by “encourag[ing] competition with cleaner, more innovative, or more transparent products.” Along related lines, the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission’s (the Antitrust Agencies) statement-of-interest filing on the BlackRock MTD sets the stage for a green-transition procompetitive defense, particularly in investment markets: “an institutional investor…could advocate in favor of the business in which it owns…stock to exit one market in favor of another, more profitable market [and] could even pressure the management of the firm to undertake such a transition [so long as this transition] would reduce output in the first market in service of achieving higher profits in another.”

This logic leaves ample room for institutional-investor defendants with substantial coal holdings to persuade the court that they did not seek to self-destruct by advocating a net-zero transition—but instead to increase profits (and improve their own investment products) by calling for energy-sector innovation that better fits evolving economic circumstances.

Applications of the Antitrust Agencies’ Statement of Interest Seem Overblown

Amid these daunting challenges still faced by the BlackRock plaintiffs, climate denialists already have doubled down on dubious antitrust rationales for stifling emissions-mitigation and disclosure initiatives.

The “woke alert” advocacy organization Consumers’ Research, for example, sent a September letter to the Antitrust Agencies, celebrating Judge Kernodle’s “vindicat[ion]” of the agencies’ BlackRock statement, which primarily argued that defendants overstated antitrust law’s exemption from Section 7 scrutiny, provided to stock acquisitions made “solely for investment.” Consumers’ Research highlights the Antitrust Agencies’ assertion that “an investment is not ‘solely for investment’ if an investor has an intent to use stock to influence significantly or control management of the target firm.”

Yet from this measured premise, Consumers’ Research mischaracterizes many reasonable business efforts to reduce climate risk as suspicious “mixed motive” practices demanding enhanced antitrust scrutiny. These suspect practices would include: an institutional investor’s public statement encouraging clarity in corporations’ greenhouse-gas reduction targets; an institutional investor’s voting of shares against incumbent directors who fail to pursue net-zero alignment; and even an investor’s mere vote for annual emissions disclosures like those increasingly required in most advanced economies.

This legal pivot from anticompetitive harms and managerial control (in the Antitrust Agencies’ statement), to a much broader array of climate-minded “business decisions,” would vastly restrict the shareholder rights of institutional investors and their clients, while harming competition in investment markets by capriciously targeting firms that engage in broad categories of risk analysis. By contrast, the Antitrust Agencies’ BlackRock statement offered multiple indications that “conferring with directors and management on best practices for…oversight processes,” or using “investment holdings and market status to influence or change…public reporting practices,” does not inevitably depart from Section 7 solely-for-investment standards. Rather, these actions confirm the “critical role in corporate governance matters” played by institutional investors. Subsequent rounds of the Texas v. BlackRock litigation hopefully will clarify that such investors need not sit on their hands as the world burns.",https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/files/2025/12/dominik-vanyi-Mk2ls9UBO2E-unsplash-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 16:05:51.883562

OPINION – Just a few miles from downtown Los Angeles, the Sterigenics sterilization facility in Vernon poses a silent threat to surrounding communities. The plant uses ethylene oxide (EtO), a toxic gas classified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a known human carcinogen, to sterilize medical equipment. Yet, many residents are not aware of the dangers of what they’ve been breathing for years.

In 2016, the EPA determined that EtO is up to 60 times more carcinogenic than previously believed, but the agency didn’t issue a public warning. When the 2018 updated National Air-Toxics Assessment finally revealed cancer-risk hotspots around sterilization plants nationwide, it was too late for many. In places like Willowbrook, Illinois, and Laredo, Texas, modeled cancer risks reached 6,400 per million people, more than 60 times the acceptable federal threshold.

In Vernon, the story bears striking similarities. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) identified the Sterigenics facility as a “Potentially High-Risk Level Facility.” While the agency requested an “Early Action Reduction Plan” in 2022, including emission monitoring and temporary shutdowns, these measures were implemented years after residents had already been exposed.

For all the communities living near the Vernon facility, this contamination is a personal issue far more than just an environmental problem. Ethylene oxide doesn’t just vanish once released. It lingers in the air and builds up in the body over time, increasing risk for breast cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia.

According to an EtO exposure map, Maywood, for instance, lies at the very center of the life-threatening emissions from the Vernon plant. In 2025 alone, the ongoing legal action against Sterigenics in Illinois resulted in 97 settlements, totaling over $30 million in payments to plaintiffs. This precedent can become an incentive for Maywood’s community in their pursuit of justice and compensation.

This crisis persists mainly due to loopholes in the EPA’s regulations. Many EtO facilities operate under Clean Air Act exemptions that allow them to avoid the modern pollution controls required of other industrial emitters.

The EPA’s 2024 rule for sterilization facilities introduced stricter EtO limits and requires leak detection, but it comes after years of delay. Still, enforcement remains uncertain, and oversight is split among federal, state, and local agencies, leaving gaps that companies can exploit. Even now, local regulators like the SCAQMD can monitor, investigate, and fine facilities, but have no authority to provide health screenings, relocation assistance, or compensation for affected families. The result is a patchwork system where accountability often blurs into bureaucracy.

Los Angeles needs actions focused on community well-being, not corporate convenience. First, federal institutions must enforce continuous air monitoring at every EtO facility and ensure public access to real-time data. People living near these potentially hazardous plants need to be constantly informed about the air quality they breathe.

Moreover, the Clean Air Act loopholes that exempt older plants from modern controls must be permanently closed. These exemptions were designed for exceptional cases that prioritize national security and were not meant to be granted loosely without consideration for the communities affected by toxic exposure.

Lastly, but most importantly, the at-risk areas need immediate medical screenings and state-funded cancer registries. This way, the federal government will finally gain a clear picture of this crisis and begin providing timely treatments and compensation to the affected people.

Los Angeles residents deserve transparency, justice, and, most of all, clean air. The EPA’s silence has already cost lives and trust. It’s time for decisive federal and state action to ensure that no one must wonder whether their next breath will turn them into cancer patients.

Texas’s one-year turnaround for Class VI applications is ambitious and could signal strength to investors if achieved with regularity.","The EPA oversees underground fluid injection well permitting through its Underground Injection Control (UIC) program. As carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects take off in the U.S., more states are seeking primary enforcement responsibilities to issue and enforce Class VI injection well permits, known as primacy. State primacy is seen as a method to streamline well permitting and allow for greater local government control. On November 12th, 2025, the EPA announced that it had approved Texas’s Class VI injection well primary enforcement application, joining a cohort of five other states with Class VI primacy: Wyoming, North Dakota, Arizona, Louisiana, and West Virginia. In this Insight, we dive into the process by which states apply for primary enforcement responsibilities, discuss the implications of primacy for the industry through the lens of Texas and Louisiana, and spotlight the expected approval timeline for Class VI permit applications still under EPA administration.

Getting Primacy

Class VI wells are used for the geologic sequestration of anthropogenic CO2. To receive primary enforcement, states must follow a four-phase process outlined by the EPA, shown below. There are currently eight states working through various phases of the approval process; of active applications, Colorado is the sole state that has progressed into Phase III, with all other states working on Pre-Application activities at Phase I. Once primacy is reached, the EPA will hand over any Class VI permit applications currently in review to the state. Of the six states with primacy, three (West Virginia, Arizona, and Texas) were granted primacy in 2025.

Permit Pause in Louisiana

Among states that have been granted primacy, Texas and Louisiana present two contrasting approaches to the program’s rollout in 2025. Like Texas, Louisiana has garnered attention for CCS projects primarily owing to its siting near major energy corridors and favorable local geology. While Texas begins the process of accepting and reviewing all Class VI permit applications, Louisiana has paused new Class VI application submissions for the near future and is instead focusing on five priority sequestration projects. This pause comes just under two years after receiving primacy in December 2023. Louisiana is currently working through a backlog of 33 Class VI well applications.

In his October 2025 executive order issuing the moratorium, Louisiana Governor Landry stated that the pause will allow for a balanced approach that considers the concerns of citizens, streamlines the permitting process, and ensures environmental due diligence. However, the pause could prove to be untimely. Contrary to most other energy transition technologies, CCS continues to benefit from bipartisan support at the federal level. This, and the fact that the pause has no explicit end date, has raised concerns among industry leaders and investors in the state that capital could be redirected to other states with active and efficient primacy programs.

Texas Chugging Along

While states continue to develop the best approach for their programs, the EPA continues to review and grant Class VI injection applications with a target turnaround of 24 months. Of the 70 Class VI applications currently in review, 18 will be transferred to the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC), the regulatory body responsible for overseeing Class VI applications in the state. This should go a long way towards increasing the EPA’s permitting efficiency. Notably, the RRC has stated that they anticipate Class VI applications in Texas to be reviewed in just six months, with another six-month waiting period before injection can begin. Other states with multiple sequestration projects, like California, Illinois, and Indiana, have not indicated that they will be pursuing primacy at this time, relying solely on the EPA’s approval process.

Going forward

As more states apply for and are granted primacy, stakeholders will watch closely to see how state-led programs influence project development, regulatory efficiency, and a broader path to decarbonization in the United States. Louisiana’s decision to pause application processing introduces some uncertainty to the industry even as it attempts to shore up its primacy process. Texas’s one-year turnaround for Class VI applications is ambitious and could signal strength to investors if achieved with regularity. However, states not pursuing primacy could also stand to benefit from permitting efficiency gains as the EPA’s backlog is cleared.

Wealthy coal plant owners – like NRG and Luminant – now have permission to avoid installing readily available, common-sense pollution controls and move forward with spewing more toxic emissions into the air.

The EPA decision withdraws a strong federal rule for Texas, finalized during the Obama Administration, that would have required upgraded or new pollution control equipment to be installed at 15 of Texas’s dirtiest coal units (see list below). In its place, Trump’s EPA approved a regional haze plan from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) that would require no pollution reductions. EPA also approved a different yet related regional haze plan from the Texas government that would likewise require zero pollution reductions from massive polluters.

Regional haze impairs visibility in natural spaces and national parks. It is produced when large industrial sources, especially coal-burning power plants, emit harmful pollution that mixes with sunlight. The Clean Air Act calls for states to propose their own plans for reducing regional haze, and if those aren’t adequate, EPA is required to implement its own federal plans that comply with the law. In Texas, haze plans from TCEQ – whose commissioners have all been appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott – have consistently been so weak they would do nothing to reduce haze in any meaningful way.

Statement from Emma Pabst, Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Manager

“For the last 20 years, Texas and EPA failed to properly implement the Clean Air Act’s requirements to reduce haze pollution in Texas, and today’s decision makes clear that both care little about clear skies on our public lands. Monitoring shows that the majority of haze comes from coal-burning power plants, and TCEQ and EPA have an obligation to reduce emissions from these facilities. But both agencies continue to blatantly disregard public input and show us – again and again – that our skies and our health aren’t important to them, especially when it comes to giving wealthy donors a pass to pollute. Americans are getting sicker, and this Administration is paving the way.”

The following coal plants would have been required to install pollution control equipment under the federal EPA haze plan, but no longer have to due to the Trump EPA withdrawal of the rule (some plants have multiple units):

Martin Lake – Beckville (East Texas), owned by Luminant/Vistra

Limestone – Jewett (east of Waco), owned by NRG

Twenty-five years ago this week, history was made when the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was signed into law after years of negotiation between the U.S. Congress, the Clinton administration and the state of Florida. This $8 billion (at the time) agreement solidified a federal-state partnership to preserve the greater Everglades ecosystem, which had been stressed by decades of water flow manipulation, unhealthy agricultural practices and unchecked urban development.

CERP was the top priority of my boss at the time, Sen. Bob Smith, a Republican from New Hampshire who called the intricate ecosystem “America’s Everglades,” an attempt in part to convey to his constituents nearly 1,500 miles away that his attention on this crown jewel was warranted.

As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which led the charge on authorizing the extensive components of the CERP, Smith set the tone for the proceedings. That started with his declaration at a Jan. 7, 2000, field hearing in Naples, Florida, that there was “no daylight” between him and the late John Chafee, his predecessor and the former EPW Committee chair with a reputation as a strong environmentalist.

The standing room only crowd cheered.

The fate of the Everglades and attempts to pass this historic restoration effort had been in question after the unexpected death of Chafee, who had been on the record as a strong proponent of the project. But the staunchly conservative Smith quickly nipped those fears in the bud and kicked off a robust set of hearings and negotiations that lasted most of the year.

CERP was being negotiated as a key part of the Water Resources Development Act, the biennial bill authorizing projects under the scope of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Ironically, the Corps was responsible for many of the issues facing the ecosystem, harkening back to a day when we prioritized development over ecosystems. But the Corps would be critical to restoring the ecosystem back to some better version of its original glory.

Enactment of the CERP was no small feat. Appropriately so; given the cost and the environmental and economic ramifications, it shouldn’t have been easy to push through Congress like many of today’s big bills. This was an era when congressional committees did due diligence to the landmark legislation they drafted.

This was an era of bipartisanship.

And looking at the accomplishment through today’s bitter political lens, passing the Everglades legislation bipartisanly feels even more remarkable. What truly made this effort special was the level of commitment from Republicans and Democrats alike to seeing the project through to the day, Dec. 11, 2000, when President Bill Clinton signed it into law.

Next to him stood an array of lawmakers across the political spectrum, including Smith, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sens. Bob Graham and Connie Mack of Florida, and most of the Florida congressional delegation. Spirits were high. Witnessing this signing is easily a top-three career moment for me personally.

But Dec. 11, 2000, isn’t just in the history books as the day the CERP was enacted. In fact, probably only a handful of us who were there at the time even remember the specific date. Dec. 11 was also the day the Supreme Court heard arguments in Bush v. Gore. But even the divisive 2000 election didn’t crush the bipartisan will to get the Everglades restoration done or the amity between the lawmakers (and staff) present for the signing.

2025 can take a lesson from 2000. We aren’t always going to agree, but we can still conduct ourselves with grace, kindness and respect without sacrificing tenacity. If we can do it for the Everglades, we should be able to do it on other important issues that touch all Americans.

The split marks a reset for one of the major U.S. electric vehicle battery partnerships, coming as slowing EV demand and the loss of U.S. subsidies push South Korean battery makers to reshape their U.S. strategies and accelerate expansion into the energy storage systems business.

SK On, a subsidiary of SK Innovation, which supplies automakers including Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp, said a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will assume full ownership and operate the Tennessee plant.

""The production start schedule for the Tennessee plant remains flexible at this time, as it is related to the ownership transition,"" SK On said.

In 2022, SK On and Ford invested $11.4 billion to build the joint battery plants in the United States.

SK On said the move reflected a strategic overhaul of assets and capacity aimed at enabling it to respond more quickly to market changes, accelerate its North American energy storage system business, and strengthen productivity and cost competitiveness in its battery operations.

The company said the restructuring is expected to improve its financial structure and profitability by sharply reducing debt and cutting fixed costs.

SK On posted an operating loss of 124.8 billion won ($84.72 million) for the July-September period, nearly double the 66.4 billion won loss in the previous quarter due to slowing EV battery shipments.

In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that electric-car sales could fall by around 50 per cent following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for buyers.

SK On has been expanding into the energy storage system business to offset weaker EV demand. In September, the company signed a deal with U.S.-based Flatiron Energy Development to supply lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems.

Other South Korean battery makers, including LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, have also been repurposing EV battery production lines to produce energy storage systems due to the phasing out of U.S. subsidies.

Energy storage batteries have a similar chemistry to automotive batteries and are used to power facilities such as data centres.

Original announcement link Source: Great British Energy","The £1 billion Energy Engineered in the UK (EEUK) programme will mobilise public and private investment to unlock critical supply chains and create thousands of skilled jobs.

As part of this programme, GBE is opening its £300 million GBE Supply Chain Fund: Offshore Wind & Networks, designed to tackle urgent bottlenecks in key components such as blades, turbines, transmission cables and converter stations.

This investment will build manufacturing capacity and ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of offshore wind deployment and electricity network innovation.

The fund is a key part of the UK Government's modern Industrial Strategy which sets out a ten-year plan to boost investment, create good skilled jobs and make Britain the best place to do business.

GBE will work alongside partners including the National Wealth Fund, Scottish National Infrastructure Bank, and The Crown Estate to unlock financing for large-scale manufacturing projects.

To cement the UK’s position as a global leader in deepwater offshore wind, GBE is also establishing a Deepwater Wind Commercialisation Programme in partnership with FLOWEX, bringing together industry leaders to unlock the industrial opportunity from the next frontier of offshore wind deployment.

With strong public backing and collaboration across government and industry, Energy Engineered in the UK will deliver:

High-value manufacturing capacity in the UK

Skilled, well-paid jobs for communities across the country

A resilient supply chain for future low-carbon technologies

Great British Energy CEO, Dan McGrail, said: 'Great British Energy is investing in British industry, we are helping to create jobs, driving innovation, and ensuring clean energy infrastructure is built here in the UK. This programme is about more than funding; it will help overcome the current challenges and ensure the benefits of a world-class supply chain are felt in communities across the country.'

Energy Minister, Michael Shanks, said: 'We want our clean energy future to be built here in Britain as part of our modern Industrial Strategy. This fund will boost our manufacturing capabilities for offshore wind – supporting jobs and growth in communities across the country.'

Great British Energy Director of Supply Chains, Rob Gilbert, said: 'Energy, Engineered in the UK, is a national initiative to drive down technology costs, crowd in private finance, and use our unique role between the public and private sector to support structured market interventions. This programme will help the UK energy sector to learn collectively, scale deliberately, and compete globally – not just on cost, but on homegrown, long-term capability. This will create jobs, economic growth, and energy security for all areas of the UK.'

Background

The £300m GBE Supply Chain Fund: Offshore Wind & Networks scheme Guidance and link to the online application portal will be available on the Great British Energy website from Thursday morning, along with other supporting documents.

Great British Energy’s £1 Billion funding for clean energy supply chains was announced earlier this as part of the Industrial Strategy launch

EEUK will invest an initial £300 million in grant funding for supply chains through the Great British Energy (GBE) Supply Chain Fund: Offshore Wind and Networks, and will invest a further £700 million in renewable energy supply chains within this parliament. This will ensure the clean energy revolution is built in Britain, bringing GBE’s total contribution up to £1 billion.

Further detail on the £700 million will be announced next year, including through the launch of an Investment Fund in Summer 2026.

As part of EEUK, Great British Energy (GBE) is today confirming the development of a Deepwater Wind Commercialisation Programme – a whole-value-chain approach to accelerate the deployment of floating wind and other deepwater technologies (“deepwater wind”), with the consideration of a competition on deepwater wind foundations and supporting serialisation as the initial areas of focus. In partnership with FLOWEX to advance floating offshore wind, the programme will set out clear next steps, timelines and delivery pathways that demonstrate GBE’s long-term commitment to the sector and to a system-wide approach to cost optimisation and UK industrial value creation. Guided by an expert team, this initiative will shape commercialisation pathways, reduce technology costs, kickstart supply chain investment and establish the UK as a global leader in deepwater offshore wind.

The programme will accelerate modularisation and standardisation of manufacturing, delivering cost reductions across the value chain, while working with partners across the sector, including wind turbine Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Working with such partners, the programme will develop commercial structures and demand signals that provide predictable, bankable markets for UK-made foundations, giving investors confidence to commit to long-term capability building.

However, in terms of sales volume during certain periods in China, the Mini EV has already surpassed the Model 3.","The Chinese Mini EV, which costs just over an iPhone, is already being touted as the world's cheapest electric car and raises an uncomfortable question for the industry: why is urban mobility still so expensive in much of the world?

In a market where a brand-new car is often synonymous with luxury, the emergence of an electric car that costs little more than an iPhone seems unattainable, but it's not. In the R$25 to R$30 range, the Mini EV shows that it's possible to have an affordable, functional electric car designed for city driving, breaking with the notion that electric vehicles are only for the wealthy, corporate fleets, or early adopters.

At the same time, this electric car, which costs little more than an iPhone, is not just a curious product: it has become a global case study. The Mini EV outsold the Tesla Model 3 at various times in China.It is manufactured on a large scale, targets very short-range urban mobility, and proves that there is pent-up demand for simple, compact, and affordable solutions.

How did the electric car that costs little more than an iPhone come about?

The idea behind this electric car, which costs little more than an iPhone, is straightforward: to meet the needs of those who require a basic urban vehicle, without luxury, but with the essentials for everyday life. Instead of betting on giant SUVs, movie screens on the dashboard, and excessive power, the Mini EV is born with a different priority: It should fit in the budget of someone who buys a premium smartphone today, not a car that costs R$ 150.

The Mini EV is the result of a partnership between Wuling, General Motors, and a Chinese giant in the sector, combining industrial scale, mastery of electric technology, and a production chain optimized for low cost. The result is a car that, in its simplest configuration, costs less than $6, or about R$25 to R$30, a price that positions it as the cheapest electric car in the world today.

In terms of its proposition, it doesn't try to compete with mid-size sedans, luxury SUVs, or high-performance models. The focus is entirely on urban mobility.: short trips, daily use in dense urban centers, easy parking, and sufficient range for a typical city routine.

Mini EV: the world's cheapest electric car that became a pop icon.

The full name is Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, but the world ended up shortening it to Mini EV. Despite its tiny size, the impact was enormous. It became the cheapest electric car in the world and, at the same time, a style icon among young Chinese people.

The Mini EV offers versions for two or four people, a single electric motor, and a typical range of... 120 to 170 km in urban use and rechargeable using a standard 220V outlet.

No superchargers, no complex infrastructure. The idea is: you get home, plug the car in, and the next day it's ready for another cycle of short trips.

What's surprising is how this inexpensive electric car has taken on a life of its own in pop culture. It's customized with stickers, flashy paint jobs, neon lights, and even kits that simulate Lamborghini-style doors.

The Mini EV has become an object of personal expression. At urban mobility events in China, it's common to see ""mini EVs"" competing to see who has the most creative design.

For a product conceived as an essential urban mobility solution, this transformation into a desirable item demonstrates its widespread appeal. Instead of simply being ""the cheapest electric car in the world,"" it has become a symbol of a new way to move around cities.

How is it possible to have a electric car That cheap?

The inevitable question is: how can an electric car that costs little more than an iPhone be viable? The answer lies in the combination of three factors: extreme simplicity, industrial scale, and a total focus on cost.

First, The Mini EV delivers only what is essential.The seats are simple, the finishes are functional, the dashboard is digital but basic, and many features considered ""convenience"" in other cars are replaced by cheap solutions.

Instead of a sophisticated multimedia center, there's smartphone support. Air conditioning is present, but without any technological frills.

Secondly, the Chinese production chain allows for the large-scale manufacturing of this inexpensive electric car, with a more competitive workforce and tax benefits geared towards electrification.

The Chinese government has been subsidizing electric vehicles for years, which helps to reduce the final price and encourage mass adoption.

Third, the Mini EV is extremely lightweight and compact. This reduces the amount of materials used and allows Smaller batteries, which are precisely the most expensive part of any electric car.

Less weight, less battery, less cost. The result is an electric car that costs little more than an iPhone, while still fulfilling the basic promise of transporting people safely in urban environments.

Urban mobility in practice: where the Mini EV shines

The Mini EV wasn't designed for high-speed cross-country driving. Its natural habitat is urban mobility: narrow streets, scarce parking spaces, short commutes, and heavy traffic. In dense cities, An inexpensive, small, and easy-to-park electric car offers obvious advantages.

For those who live and work in the same area of ​​the city, a range of 120 to 170 km is more than enough.

Charging via a standard wall outlet solves the problem for those who don't have access to fast charging networks. And the cost of energy is much lower than that of gasoline, which reinforces its economic appeal.

In the context of urban mobility, this electric car, which costs little more than an iPhone, offers another benefit: silence and zero local pollutant emissions.

In cities with increasingly polluted air and constant traffic jams, Every inexpensive electric car that replaces a combustion engine vehicle helps reduce noise and polluting gases.

Therefore, the Mini EV is often cited as a living laboratory of what a city with more compact electric vehicles could look like, designed not for showing off, but to solve everyday commutes in a simple way.

The threat to major automakers and the Tesla effect.

When people talk about electric cars, many automatically think of Tesla. However, in terms of sales volume during certain periods in China, the Mini EV has already surpassed the Model 3.

And this sends a clear message to the industry: There's a huge market of people who don't want luxury, they just want a cheap electric car that works.

Traditional automakers like Volkswagen, Fiat, Renault, Toyota, and others have accelerated their electric compact car projects, trying to occupy this space before it is dominated by ultra-cheap solutions from China.

Citroën, for example, launched the AMI, an urban electric microcar. But in markets like Brazil, it still costs over R$100, a far cry from the proposition of an electric car that costs little more than an iPhone.

The Mini EV, with its crushing price tag, is forcing the entire industry to rethink costs, platforms, and even the logic of profit per unit.

If it's possible to make the world's cheapest electric car with a well-defined, essential package, why do so many models still cost double or triple? This is the question that bothers the boards of directors of car manufacturers.

Would an electric car that costs little more than an iPhone work in Brazil?

From an urban mobility standpoint, the Mini EV would be a perfect fit for cities like São Paulo, Curitiba, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, or Recife. Short distances, heavy traffic, tight parking spaces, and high fuel costs create the perfect scenario for an affordable electric car.

The problem is that the current Mini EV model wasn't designed to meet Brazilian standards. It still doesn't meet all local safety requirements, such as front airbags and stability control, and it lacks Inmetro certification to be driven as a passenger vehicle here. In other words, the world's cheapest electric car is still facing regulatory hurdles.

Some import companies are already studying adapted versions, with reinforcements and additional security systems, to try to make something similar viable in the domestic market.

If this happens at a competitive price, an electric car costing little more than an iPhone could explode in adoption and put significant pressure on the entry-level segment, where today a basic combustion engine car easily exceeds R$ 80.

What the Mini EV reveals about the future of urban mobility.

Ultimately, the Mini EV is less about itself and more about what it reveals. He proves that the future doesn't have to be made up only of giant, expensive cars full of screens.

This shows that there is room for a new generation of small, affordable electric vehicles that are deeply connected to real urban mobility, not just the idea of ​​status.

An inexpensive electric car like this, comparable in price to a top-of-the-line smartphone, reveals a shift in mindset: perhaps it doesn't make sense to pay a fortune for a vehicle that sits idle most of the time and travels, on average, only a few kilometers a day.

The electric car, which costs little more than an iPhone, opens the door to a broader discussion about consumption, cities, public transportation, bike lanes, micromobility, and urban planning.

If such an inexpensive solution already exists and works on a large scale in another country, the issue ceases to be technological and becomes one of politics, regulation, and business model.

And those paying attention to this transformation realize that the Mini EV may be just the first of many. As new generations of compact electric cars emerge, with greater safety, better finish, and still a low price, the pressure on the current mobility model is likely to increase.

If the world's cheapest electric car is already a reality, the remaining question is simple: What is preventing our cities and our laws from truly enabling this more accessible urban mobility?",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Carro-eletrico-que-custa-menos-que-um-iPhone-vira-fenomeno-mundial-Mini-EV-com-custo-por-volta-de-R-25-mil-desafia-montadoras-vende-mais-que-Tesla-na-China-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 13:03:44.020233

Offshore wind creates good union jobs, provides reliable energy, and makes our environment healthier and our air cleaner.","A federal judge has vacated President Donald Trump’s executive memorandum, lifting the pause on federal permitting for wind energy projects in a ruling on a lawsuit brought by over a dozen state attorneys general and the Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Several state-based climate jobs coalitions filed an amicus brief supporting the lawsuit. The brief described workers’ and labor unions’ extensive investments of their time and resources to train for the offshore wind energy sector, which promises to be a large and growing source of domestic jobs.

This legal decision is a major victory in efforts to deliver clean power to communities across America.

“As energy demand rises and utility bills are burdening working families, we need reliable, domestic energy sources that keep the lights on and provide family-sustaining jobs for our communities,” said Climate Jobs Massachusetts in a statement. “Offshore wind projects have created thousands of jobs in Massachusetts alone, and our union members have invested millions of dollars to train workers in specialized skills for building them. With several more projects ready to go, the wind industry will bring thousands more family-sustaining jobs to Massachusetts, as long as the federal government issues the necessary permits. This ruling is an important step towards green-lighting the clean energy projects our region desperately needs. We thank Attorney General Campbell for her leadership in standing up for workers and the clean energy projects that will benefit our communities in countless ways.”

“President Trump’s unpopular and illegal wind ban undercut the ability of Maine and New England to become energy independent and stabilize electricity prices for working families. It left nearly completed wind projects abandoned offshore in other parts of New England, stalled critical port development in Maine, laid off thousands of workers, and kept a large amount of clean power off of the grid that could have brought hundreds of millions of dollars of savings to households across the region. Union members in Maine invested in specialized training to prepare for offshore wind – training made possible by hundreds of thousands of dollars in union-backed workforce development. These workers are ready to build the next generation of clean, reliable power. Political interference took those job opportunities away,” said the Maine Labor Climate Council. “We thank Attorney General Aaron Frey and the coalition of attorneys general for their leadership in holding the federal government accountable and defending a clean energy future that benefits working people.”

Climate Jobs Rhode Island stated, “This decision protects good union jobs, years of workforce training, and the future of a clean-energy industry that Rhode Island workers have helped build from the ground up. Climate Jobs Rhode Island joined our regional labor partners in filing an amicus brief to show exactly what was at stake: the livelihoods of skilled workers who trained, worked, and sacrificed to make offshore wind real in our state. Today’s ruling means those workers can keep doing what they do best, building America’s energy future with union skill, safety, and pride. Thank you to AG Peter Neronha for standing with workers and defending our state’s future. We are ready to keep building.”

In Rhode Island, the federal government is also waging separate challenges to Revolution Wind, a 704-MW offshore wind project set to power 350,000 New England homes and support over 1,000 jobs. The federal government issued a stop work order on the project in August 2025, and while a subsequent federal court ruling allowed construction to resume, workers remain uneasy about the future of their jobs. Climate Jobs Rhode Island and the Rhode Island AFL-CIO recently released a video featuring workers on the project.

Climate Jobs New York also jointly announced with environmental groups the delivery of more than 14,000 petition signatures from New Yorkers urging continued advancement of wind project permitting and offshore wind development. The signatures, collected through collaborative organizing efforts, signal that New Yorkers clearly understand the value of offshore wind for jobs, energy costs, and the environment.

“New York’s offshore wind industry is creating thousands of family-sustaining union jobs, strengthening local economies, and building a more resilient energy system,” said Esther Rosario, Executive Director of Climate Jobs NY. “This ruling brings much-needed stability to the permitting process and to the lives of the workers across our state who depend on these projects. The public’s strong support shows how urgent it is to continue to move forward.”

“This decision is a victory for Ironworkers in Maryland and our brothers and sisters from across the labor movement. For years, we in labor have known that offshore wind is a critical piece of our energy future, and accordingly, we have invested heavily in training our members to work in this industry,” said Kendall Martin, President of the Ironworkers District Council of the Mid-Atlantic States. “This week’s legal victory is an important step toward ensuring that training will continue to be put to use. Offshore wind creates good union jobs, provides reliable energy, and makes our environment healthier and our air cleaner. As energy demand is skyrocketing and costs are burdening families, we need to bring as much domestic, affordable power online as possible. Offshore wind is ready to provide that power. Let’s get back to work building it.”

Tag: Latitude Media, covering the new frontier of the energy transition.

Shayle Kann: I’m Shayle Kann and this is Catalyst.

Alex Modon: As a third party contractor, your incentive is really, we only make money when the project costs more and takes longer. So yeah, high level what’s broken is it’s the incentive structure.

Shayle Kann: Coming up: Is there a better way using modern technology to build big capital projects?

I’m Shayle Kann. I lead the early stage venture strategy at Energy Impact Partners. Welcome. All right, so here’s a cycle that I have seen play out many, many times. Developer X of project Y wants to go build a big new project and somewhere in the development process they engage in EPC, EPC being an engineering, procurement, construction firm, there are many of them. Many of them are very, very large and they’re kind of ubiquitous. If you’re going to build the big capital project, they engage the EPC and then there’s a fairly painful process from there on where it’s slower than they want it to be. They have to go through multiple cycles of iteration. There’s a value engineering, the cost comes in higher than they expect, and then at the end of the day, a bunch of change orders anyway. And there are cost overruns, there are time overruns.

It’s not necessarily the fault of the EPC, right? Lots of things can happen in the world, but the process of actually getting big projects constructed is notoriously hard, and some folks have been wondering whether there’s a way to leverage modern technology, AI included, to do it better. Certainly that is the opinion of Alex Modan, who is our guest today. Alex is the CEO and co-founder of Unlimited Industries, which is a startup that recently unstealthed to basically be a modern EPC. They’re trying to start from scratch to build a company that will do engineering, procurement and construction with new technology, with a different business model to try to get projects built faster, more on budget, potentially cheaper. It’s an interesting question and it applies to everything from data centers to power generation projects, battery storage projects, new chemical plants, anything that we might build that’s a big capital project, so it’s relevant to basically everything else that we talk about here. Anyway, here’s Alex.

Alex, welcome.

Alex Modon: Hello. Thanks for having me.

Shayle Kann: Thanks for being here. Let’s talk about EPC, engineering, procurement construction. You founded a company based on the premise that it could be done better, so I want to start with what’s wrong with it today. As you’ve observed EPCs and how they work fundamentally, what is the problem that you see?

Alex Modon: Yeah, well, it might be first contextualizing the what is EPC and where does it play in the value chain? So to start this, let’s just imagine we’re going to build, I don’t know, let’s just say a data center project. So if we want to go build a data center project as an owner of a project or a developer of a project, the first thing that we do is we kind of find the land and we contract that and we start to figure out what permits we need. We figure out what power we need to buy, and then you typically go find an offtaker or some sort of tenant for that actual data center project or again, whatever the product is that comes out of the facility, the last big contract that you’re trying to do is go find the third party that’s going to design and build the thing.

EPC, engineering, procurement construction is basically the vertically integrated or all three of the design, manage the supply chain, actually manage the build of the project, all three of those in one contractor. And for all intents and purposes, they are the people who design and build the thing that EPC piece. And so I think when I got into it, I was actually really excited the first time we went to go work with an EPC thinking that there’s going to be all these different kind of disciplines and institutional knowledge under one shingle. I think the biggest thing that’s challenged with the industry today is that the incentives between the developer, the person who actually wants to build the thing better, faster, cheaper, or some sort of metric like that versus the third party, the incentives are so fundamentally misaligned because of how these contracts get produced. You either have, the vast majority of these contracts have some element of cost plus where we’ll give some sort of guidance about how much the project’s going to cost.

But as a third party contractor, your incentive is really, we only make money when the project costs more and takes longer. Or there’s sometimes these contracts that run on a fixed firm basis where that third party will actually say, Hey, we will build it for this much, but they define the contract so tightly that inevitably what happens is when you learn something through the design process or when things change, which inevitably they always do, you get issued these massive change orders and at that point that’s where that third party EPC typically makes all their margin just because you’re already working together and you can’t really easily leave. So yeah, high level what’s broken is it’s the incentive structure, the incentives between the third party or the actual developer who wants to build better, faster, cheaper, and the third party who’s in control of making all the decisions about what gets designed and what actually gets built.

Shayle Kann: If I’m being charitable to EPCs, and I asked the question of why is it cost plus typically or fixed firm, but where change orders are the norm, I would imagine in part it is because there’s one, there’s this time lag, right? There’s signing the contract on day one, but they’re actually procuring the commodity materials six months later, a year later, 18 months later, whatever it might be. Those prices are volatile. They would have to hedge them every single time if they weren’t going to do that. Not to mention labor availability and labor costs and all this other stuff. Is it because they just can’t wear that kind of a risk, the time risk? Or is your experience that there’s a different reason why it ended up being cost plus or fixed firm with all sorts of change orders?

Alex Modon: No, I mean definitely to steelman, it’s because it’s ultra complex to build these projects. There are hundreds of people that’ll be involved in how the thing gets designed that manages the entire supply chain to get it built and then manages all the boots on the ground of the project that’s actually doing the building. So there is tons of complexity and the reason that these contracts are structured in this inherently flexible way is because it’s really hard to know upfront how much exactly is the thing going to cost. So yeah, I mean it certainly has evolved this way because when you think about these projects, and I mean the small version of these are like a hundred million dollars, the more normal version of these is many hundreds of millions, and then the bigger ones are certainly in the meaty billions of costs. So because you have all that risk, the contracts effectively are this big risk mitigation strategy, and the easy way for the e PC not to take any risk is just to say, we’re going to get a margin on top of what it costs us to build a thing, but the problem is that there’s no motivation then to make the thing cost less.

If anything, there’s a motivation the other way to make it cost more.

Shayle Kann: Yeah. You mentioned there’s a lot of people and a lot of uncertainty. I mean, I guess one way I think about it is that there’s a spectrum of different types of projects. On one end of the spectrum is a thing that looks the same every time you build it more or less. I mean maybe a version of this would be, I don’t know, utility scale battery projects or utility scale solar or something like that where we’ve built hundreds of them, they generally look the same wherever you go. And you would imagine that on those types of projects it would be pretty well known. Maybe there’s some commodity risk, maybe there’s some labor risk, but broadly speaking, the designs are going to be similar and the experience is high. And then on the other end of the spectrum, there’s a first of a kind thing that’s never been built before and they’re obviously your error bars on the cost and the time, the labor and all that is going to be highest. And then there’s a bunch of stuff in between. I imagine data centers are in between actually because in some ways they look the same. There’s like a powered shell, the shell is a building, but then inside the data center there’s all sorts of innovation. Is this one liquid cool, this one using which Nvidia chips? Is it using- How is it designed? There’s so much innovation in that space that it’s changing all the time,

Alex Modon: Which also changes the facility too. These changes trickle out for sure.

Shayle Kann: Right. So I guess as you think about this, the incentive structure being misaligned, do you view it as being more misaligned on I guess relatively speaking, easier stuff to Bill because there you should be able to have high level of certainty on what the cost should be, or is it more misaligned on the esoteric stuff because the error bars are even higher and so the risk aversion of the EPC leads them to way over price, for example?

Alex Modon: Yeah, I mean definitely the contingencies are the egregiousness of this cost misalignment is certainly true with the more custom the project gets. So the first of a kinds are a great example of that, or you even mentioned data centers that are shifting in their requirements of course have more and more of this baked in. It’s basically just correlated to risk. How much risk is there in this solar has less and less risk as we deploy more and more the exact same way. Same thing with utility storage, but I do think that where you see, so you definitely get misaligned contracts or misaligned incentives, which kind of balloon costs, and that is the kind of status quo for how you contract these things anyways, but the other thing that falls into this is how projects broadly are approached. And so if you think about how we build products, we have a metric for it. We say, Hey, we’re going to make this widget, it’s going to come out of a factory. We’ll have some sort of cost per widget metric, and that allows us to approach these projects with this continuous improvement type approach and drive costs down. That’s like our learning rate. I think arguably that’s why solar has fallen so aggressively is because we keep kind of making, or at least I should say the module costs, which is even different than, this is maybe a side tangent, but it’s different than the actual install costs.

Shayle Kann: Yeah, well, it’s actually the problem with solar is that the module costs have fallen much faster than the installed costs have. We haven’t solved it on the construction and all the other commodity materials and stuff.

Alex Modon: And that’s all progress happens with this highly iterative process and this continuous improvement process that we get out of manufacturing a thing. But when we move into projects world, everything’s a snowflake. It’s like everything’s n of one. Even a project that we’re building, we built lots of refineries. That next refinery that we build is still an N of one project. And because it’s approached in that way, you don’t really get any sort of benefits of learning through that process. And by definition, each project’s going to be unique. It’s a different piece of land. But, and again, maybe this is a tangent, but that’s another big problem in the industry is everything’s done from scratch. So even if you’re going to go design a slightly different data center or a solar project or something else of that sort, every tweak or change that you make effectively reintroduces the entire redesign of the process. And so yes, there’s some stuff that gets lifted, but the overall amount of work that happens is not the kind of delta of the change. It is a significant rehaul of work and it just keeps us from learning and iterating to improve how something gets designed, not just in terms of saving engineering costs, which is actually a pretty small piece of the cost anyways, but actually having a better design that improves the overall cost or performance of the facility.

Shayle Kann: I guess one thing I wonder is, okay, so let’s take EPC, engineering, procurement and construction. Just taking at the simplest base layer of what the work entails, let’s just say you could dramatically improve because what you’re describing is the learning I think I guess maybe is on all three, but predominantly on engineering. Can you design this thing so that it’s fast and easy to design is definitely going to work upfront. My guess is that in most of these big capital projects, the E out of EPC is the smallest slice of the pie in terms of total cost. And the bulk of the cost probably comes from a combination of procurement, the actual physical materials, much of which are going to be like steel and cement and aluminum and commodities that have prices that vary. And then construction, which is sort of a function, it’s an outcropping of how the engineering occurs, but certainly is also just driven by construction process and labor and so on. So as you think about where is there an opportunity to deliver cost reduction and also cost certainty, how much of it is the E versus the P versus the C?

Alex Modon: Yeah, totally. Okay. So those are two separate things, right? So let’s say cost certainty versus an overall reduction cost. On the certainty side, everything, it’s really kind of planned out or teased out in the engineering portion. And so generally, again, lifecycle of these projects are you start with some conceptual design, you understand maybe plus or minus 50% how much the thing is going to cost. Then for the most part you dig into this front end engineering design and you’ll get to totally changes per project, but say you get to plus or minus 10% a cost, and that gives you enough confidence to go to a lender, an actual bank and say, Hey, let’s underwrite this project. We think you’re going to get the IRR you need, and then we move forward. But in the vast majority of projects, when you go to final investment decision and you have plus or minus 10% estimates, you’re only maybe 30% of the way through your engineering, 70% you still have to go do, and it doesn’t make sense to do it upfront because it takes a lot of time and it costs a lot of money and it’s a lot easier to finance that with the actual lender’s money rather than the development capital.

So the certainty that you have going into a project before you actually take the money from the bank to go build it is actually pretty low. There’s so much more work to go do and you just don’t do it because there’s a high marginal cost of the engineering. So one way that you really reduce all the risk, if you will, or all this uncertainty from how the project’s going to work, is if you could instead just take these projects further through the design process so that by the time you’re doing your earthwork, so you’re moving some sort of ground, you’re actually a hundred percent done. You have your issue for construction package, which doesn’t happen today. And so there’s that big piece on how do you remove uncertainty, how do you remove costs? I mean, yeah, you’re totally right. The engineering cost is anywhere from three to 10% or 15% of the project costs.

So it’s not a huge lever in itself. But if you think about the way these projects are designed today, because again, such a high marginal cost to engineering, what you end up doing is you only really design something one pass through. There’s no sort of iteration, there’s no optimization of design, and that leads you to a spot where you make early decisions, you freeze those design decisions, you do the next stage gate of design of your design process, and you eventually get stuck in these very low local optimums rather than ever understanding what the global optimum of that design process is. So yeah, I can get more into how we approach this problem, but there’s huge gains and opportunities to use the E to rapidly reduce the P and the C.

Shayle Kann: Okay. Let’s talk about how to use technology, which is I think what you’re alluding to here. This is an area where my suspicion is generally it’s not the first category of AI adoption or at least it hasn’t been historically. Where do you see the biggest opportunity? Where are the step function improvements that one can achieve by leveraging modern technology, be it AI or something else?

Alex Modon: Yeah, so we have built a lot of technology to help accelerate that pre-construction phase. So this is basically the E and lots of the procurement management side of things. And we have a software and kind of like an AI native version of this that helps accelerate the chemical design, mechanical, electrical, civil, structural controls. And in doing that, we basically are building a platform that allows us to remove that risk, but at a very, very low marginal cost that helps you accelerate through the design process, not just saving time, but exploring a much wider search base and getting to much greater levels of definition before you actually have to freeze designs. That has a big impact. To previous point, it is just removing uncertainty, reducing costs through optimization.

Shayle Kann: Can you go a level deeper on that? What does that actually mean to reduce uncertainty using software? What are you actually doing?

Alex Modon: Yeah. If you start a project today at zero, completely uncertain, and as you start specifying or defining bringing definition to that project, which is the process of engineering it, you start to remove risk. You say, Hey, we can actually size a pump that will solve that moving the fluid from point A to point B, or actually we can design a tank like this to hold this amount of volume. And once you start providing that level of definition, you remove a lot of the ambiguity, but there’s still tons and tons that goes into the thousands of documents that you’ll generate to design a plant fully. So this is what we have built. It is a platform that our engineers use. I think the important distinction here is this is not like a software technology that we sell. It’s like we use this as an internal tool ourselves.

So our engineers have this AI platform that has all of their data in one place, all the requirements about the project, all of the potential vendors that could be used, and they use it to basically accelerate that design process really significantly. We haven’t redefined how you’re engineering these projects. We’ve significantly augmented the people that are doing that work so that they’re able to just with the same amount of time and capital, they’re able to define way more and provide way more engineering definition as well as time to optimize those designs. So you can remove suboptimal design.

Shayle Kann: Can you articulate a little bit what is distinct about this from the EPCs? Have been using engineering software that is super mature for a long time, maybe that’s the problem, but what’s distinct about what you just described from what you could just get off the shelf to design a project?

Alex Modon: Most of the software in this industry really hasn’t changed much in the last maybe 20 years. And I again kind of always come back to the incentive structure. There’s no real incentive structure for an EPC to want better software. It’s the same reason your law firm doesn’t necessarily want AI software to help them accelerate and reduce their billables. So the way these softwares work now is that there’s a bunch of distributed software solutions or maybe decentralized solutions. So you’ll have a CAD tool that you use to actually do the designs. You’ll do almost all of your rough engineering or hand calcs in Excel. You’ll use dedicated simulation software for some sort of fluid design or structural analysis or whatever that might be.

And then you use another tool to review those PDFs with a tool to put red lines on them and go through design cycles and then push to drafters and then other tools to manage how do you reach out to your vendors? And anyways, there’s all these different software solutions that you’re using in order to do engineering. And what we built from day one was just a modern version of the software. So we put all those different disparate tools into one underlying platform and we gave modern software to them, which is automatically doing version control and collaboration and everything that you would expect out of just a modern tool. And what that allows us to do is not just have much more streamlined workflows, but it allows us to build AI in as a core primitive to the solution. So now sometimes our engineers will do some sort of work manually within one of our softwares, but often they will dedicate delegate a task to an AI that knows how to use all those tools in our software so that it can do that design task, do that design task, and then surface that back to the engineer who delegated it.

Shayle Kann: So it’s at least in significant part, it’s like integration of a bunch of what otherwise are kind of disparate workflows to allow for faster iteration and more automated iteration. You do a change somewhere in one piece of software right now you’d have to go to another piece of software, make the change in that software, see how it changes the other thing, do that over and over again. So it’s like building everything into a single comprehensive suite basically.

Alex Modon: Yeah, totally. There’s one underlying data model. There’s not the same piece of data that shows up in 10 different softwares, and that’s really helpful not just again for streamlining your own workflows, but it’s so that an AI can do it and it doesn’t have to manage all these different tools and interfaces that the same information is repeated but out of date and or edited by the wrong person who didn’t have permission or something of that sort.

Shayle Kann: When you say AI in this context, what do you mean? Is it LLM type AI where you’re like, I want to be able to, in my single pane of glass, be able to ask what would happen if I changed all the screws in this entire project from X to Y or something like that? Is it LLM ai? Is it? What is the ai? There’s also a version of what you’re describing that’s like enterprise software for sure, but doesn’t a big data component to it, but it’s not inherently AI.

Alex Modon: Yeah, no, it’s like an exact use case, the one that you gave that you would do. So we’ll record all our meetings and that meeting you’re having with a handful of different disciplines of engineers or people who understand the commercial, the agreement and what that’ll trigger through that recording is a bunch of tasks for Ais to go do and it’s us. You just basically mentioned a trade there. It’s like what if we had, I don’t know, one type of material over another type of material, one type of conveyance over another type of conveyance for this project to this material an AI will go explore that different design path, and that’s a trade that you would give to an engineer and you’d say, Hey, go spend a week, assess the trade-off between using belt conveyance or pneumatic conveyance for some sort of material handling problem and then tell me back what do we feel like is the right total cost of ownership trade?

And it’ll just explore that. And so that’s an LLM who’s doing a lot of that work and importantly, you’re not just asking a chat GBT or something of that sort to go explore that and produce something which it’ll do and honestly, it’ll do in a pretty impressive way, but the way that we’ve built it is that it’s grounded both inside of the data for the project, it has all that in one place and then inside of the tools that we’ve set it because it knows how to use, how to down select actual vendors or how to read spec sheets that we fed it or how to use simulation software that we fed it in order to derive these answers.

Shayle Kann: You mentioned data centers, and I think you guys put that in as one of the categories you’re most interested in your announcement when you guys unveiled. Is that because we’re building a lot of data centers or is that because there’s something specific to data centers and data center construction and engineering that makes it especially attractive here or is there something else that you would describe as the perfect prototypical use case for this in the early days is X?

Alex Modon: So these projects have a handful of different reasons of why you would apply this technology. In the data center use case specifically, speed is really an important lever for them. And so you can take instead of the design portion taking, call it six to nine months of your critical path, we can massively collapse that period of time, and that’s really important for these data center projects to accelerate how quickly we can actually build them. The same piece though with the fact that if you right now budget six to nine months for your design portion, almost none of that, you’re going to start to figure out, well, how do we optimize that design or do some sort of value engineering to save costs or to design for long lead items or to design for constructability. So really strong value prop in these data center projects as we end up increasing the capacity that we have on our team though it’ll make sense to pick up basically many of these types of large industrial projects of which we’ve already pushed the technology to be able to demonstrate and it’ll end up being really applicable across all types of construction.

Shayle Kann: So if you can deliver more certainty upfront, then that presumably is the thing that unlocks a different kind of business model that hopefully solves the incentive problem. Is that just a fixed price contract with no change orders allowed or what does that look like?

Alex Modon: That’s exactly it. We literally put no change orders in our contracts,

Shayle Kann: So you wear the risk to make it explicit, you wear all the risk basically if there’s a cost overrun, you’re going to go negative on the project. And the premise here is that because EPCs notoriously don’t have huge margins, right? Construction firms are like high volume, low margin type businesses, and so I guess the thinking on your side has got to be because we are reducing the cost of everything along the way, we naturally have higher margins, which would allow us a little bit of a buffer if things do become a little more expensive than we expected. At least we’re not in the red. Do I have that concept right?

Alex Modon: RYeah. I mean we definitely will have a different margin profile than the industry, but it’s not that because even when you think about it, the engineering margin, it’s it’s pretty small because the spend of the engineering is actually really small relative to the larger construction scope of the project. The important part of what allows us to absorb that risk without the kind of risk that we go into the red, or at least in a risk adjusted way, is because we’ve been able to do so much design upfront and we’ve been able to not only remove all that extra risk by taking the definition, instead of doing that at 30%, we can take that definition all the way through a hundred percent. You just remove all this ambiguity of how much the thing should actually cost. So again, traditionally when someone gives a contract to go build a project, because they have such little core definition, they don’t know all the vendors that they’re going to buy from. They have you even mentioned, I think this example earlier of there’s a tariff risk By the time that you fund the project and you commit to a cost tariff can change in six more months. You need to finish the design in order to order the parts. That doesn’t exist in our world because we’ve been able to just very, very quickly remove all this risk before we actually commit to a price and that’s very unique.

Shayle Kann: Wait, how does that work? So it’s a good specific example. So I guess what you would do is issue the purchase order for all of the material before you commit to a price to the customer. How do you avoid the tariff?

Alex Modon: Yeah, exactly. It’s timing it all out. So just to compare this again to how it works today is you’d only when you’d say, Hey, we’re the EPC, we’re going to give you a performance guarantee or some sort of fixed firm price When you go to buy this or fund this project with a notice to proceed or final investment decision, at that point you literally don’t even know all your bulks, so all your commodity equipment, the steel that you need, the wire that you need, et cetera, we will know all of that at this point in time because we’re not 30% definition, we’re a hundred percent engineering definition, and because we have this entire equipment list at this point in time, we know either how to say, Hey, let’s purchase everything at the same day that the project gets funded. Let’s go either purchase everything or let’s design hedges from a cost perspective so that we’re not exposed to some sort of volatility or risk

Shayle Kann: That’s complex. I’m thinking of these big construction projects and you’re either on the day that you sign the contract, you’re either buying all of the steel just as a random specific example, or you’re hedging steel prices at the project by project level to make sure that you don’t overpay for steel. That’s what you need to do.

Alex Modon: Yeah. That’s what allows you to truly have a very different risk assessment for how these projects get built and that what gives you a ability to do a fixed firm and actually mean most of these fixed firms aren’t really like industry themselves. I mean, we’ve seen time and time again where it’s like a fixed firm doesn’t really mean a fixed firm because there’s inevitably some way that in the thousand page contract that you assigned with your EPC, you went out of scope and invalidated that price and hence the kind of change order triggering.

Shayle Kann: I guess the other thing that I wonder how you manage is subcontractors, right? It’s another area where change orders come from, not just the general contractor or the EPC having to make a change order, but also because some subcontractor made a change order. So do you have to flow this all? First of all, are you going to use subcontractors? You’re just going to do everything and have a ton of people on staff, and if you are going to use subcontractors, do you have to then flow this change in a structure down through all of them where they can’t issue any change orders to you either?

Alex Modon: Yeah, certainly long-term we will do everything in-house. We will vertically integrate as much as possible because that’s where you can fix the incentives all the way through. Yes, for these initial projects as we take, we are working friendly with the local GC or even the trades, even the actual folks that we will subcontract a lot of this work out to. For that it is making sure that we, prior to entering into a contract, you have kind of the same thing, where often those contracts are not as the level of definition that you have when you’re asking someone to actually give you a fixed price on what a scope of work is. Very hard. We don’t have that same problem. We take things way deeper through definition, and we have a much better understanding of what should this actually cost to go build. So yeah, there’s a handful of different ways that we kind of approach working with the actual subcontractors as we do this to hit our performance goals, but it is this kind of like a continuing loop of how do you remove more and more risk through design.

Shayle Kann: Alright, so wrap it up. You don’t have to give me exact numbers, but when should we expect to see the first COD? When should we expect to see the first project constructed by you guys?

Alex Modon: I love it. Yeah, we’ll hopefully see you next year, so hopefully by the end of next year. Yeah,

Shayle Kann: Fast is the rule. Alex, thank you so much for the time. Really appreciate it.

Grumet did not answer questions about his April exchange with Brown, Ocean Winds’ CEO for North America. An ACP spokesperson said the group does not comment on internal deliberations.

Brown said in a statement that he always approaches ACP’s offshore wind leadership meetings with the goal of presenting Ocean Winds’ positions “directly and openly, with an aim to drive consensus and achieve, where possible, common industry goals.”

The White House says no one should have been shocked by Trump’s actions.

“President Trump has been extremely transparent: wind energy is the scam of the century,” spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement.

“Reversing the Green New Scam was a very popular promise President Trump made on the campaign trail to the American people, who were tired of the Left’s radical and expensive climate agenda,” she added. “President Trump issued very direct policy guidance on offshore wind on day one, which the administration has been working diligently to carry out.”

Trump denounces wind power just about every chance he gets, including during the White House’s July 4 picnic for military families, his address to the United Nations General Assembly in September, last month’s U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, and numerous posts on his social media network, Truth Social.

“Wind is the worst,” Trump said Tuesday night at a rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. “That’s a scam. They ruin your valleys. They ruin your peaks. And [it’s] the most expensive energy.”

‘A destruction of the industry’

This portrait of the offshore wind industry’s year under Trump is based on interviews with more than a dozen offshore wind executives and lobbyists and an administration official.

During the Biden era, the idea of erecting turbines along the nation’s coasts symbolized a vision of greening the economy, easing the threat of climate change and creating a new generation of manufacturing jobs. But now, unraveling the industry has come to represent Trump’s push for a rapid ramp-up of fossil fuels, which would include opening wide stretches of the shoreline to oil and gas drilling.

Overnight, the United States’ appeal to wind developers worldwide has vanished.

“There is no one in the world right now that is looking to do a wind project in the United States,” one industry lobbyist told POLITICO.

“What you’re seeing,” remarked another executive, “is a destruction of the industry.”

Another executive, Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch, told POLITICO journalists in Berlin this fall: “The American offshore wind market currently does not exist.”

At the same time, recent months have revealed limits to Trump’s campaign to crush offshore wind.

In September, a federal judge overturned the Interior Department’s decision to halt construction of a nearly completed wind project south of New England. Unlike other lower court rulings on Trump’s use of tariffs and the deployment of the National Guard, the administration did not appeal the decision. And on Monday, a separate federal judge declared Trump’s permitting freeze unlawful, handing a major victory to Democratic states in the case that Brown had argued the wind industry should join.

Meanwhile, staffers at the White House and Interior Department are discussing a proposal that would allow five offshore wind projects under construction to reach completion, according to three people familiar with the administration’s thinking. They include the country’s largest project, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, which could generate enough electricity to power hundreds of thousands of homes, and a pair of massive projects on either shore of Long Island that would collectively supply more than 1 million homes.

Yet even that approach would allow the administration to revoke permits for other projects approved by the Biden administration that have yet to start construction. Just last week, the administration asked a federal judge to send an already-issued permit for an offshore wind project near Massachusetts back for further review.

All three people stressed that Trump himself has yet to sign off on the idea, noting he could easily demand that all projects under construction be shut down.

Even so, the mere fact that the administration is discussing the idea internally underscores the complicated future facing offshore wind companies in the United States. The five wind farms under construction would rank among the largest renewable energy projects ever built in the United States — one of which, Coastal Virginia, has the vocal support of some key Republicans. If completed, the five projects would represent the culmination of a more than two-decade campaign to break into the American market.

Already, wind produced more than 10 percent of the nation’s electricity in 2024. Last year, wind, solar and batteries accounted for an estimated 93 percent of the new power added to the U.S. grid, according to a POLITICO review of federal data.

But it’s unclear if any additional offshore wind projects will ever be built, regardless of what Trump decides. Even if they are, the mere attempt to repeal their permits has shaken wind companies’ faith in the U.S. market. Some executives said their companies would be wary of investing in the U.S. in the future.

After Interior halted Empire Wind off the Long Island coast in April, its Norwegian developer Equinor estimated that the stoppage cost it $50 million a week. Similarly, the two companies behind the joint venture building Revolution Wind, a 65-turbine project south of New England, told a federal court that a monthlong stoppage issued in August cost their project $70 million.

Both orders were ultimately lifted, but the long-term damage in the eyes of many companies was done. Ørsted, the Danish offshore wind giant and one of the two companies building Revolution Wind, has said it intends to shift its focus to Europe and Asia after completing its two U.S. projects under construction. Miguel Stilwell d’Andrade, the CEO of the Portuguese-based EDP Renewables, said last month that his company’s American offshore wind projects were “in hibernation.” EDP and the French developer Engie are the two companies behind Ocean Winds.

Not even the prospect of Trump someday leaving office is brightening wind companies’ view of the U.S. market.

“It seems impossible right now, that in a world where you have four-year presidential windows, that you could get an offshore wind project from complete pause to a point where you can make an investment decision, where you can be confident that you’re not getting a stop-work order halfway through construction,” said the industry executive worried about the “destruction of the industry.”

Singled out

Offshore wind is hardly alone. The president has taken a wrecking ball to the entirety of Biden’s climate and energy agenda, signing a sweeping budget law that aggressively phases out clean energy tax credits, halting permits for high-profile solar projects in the West and imposing new regulatory burdens that onshore wind developers worry will derail other projects.

No industry has endured Trump’s wrath quite like offshore wind, however.

“I think what’s happening now is a reflection of one person’s very specific views about offshore wind,” said Liz Klein, a former Biden administration official who led offshore wind efforts as director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

Internal divisions within the renewable industry have hampered its ability to respond to Trump’s attacks — and the April spat between Ocean Winds’ Brown and the American Clean Power Association’s Grumet reflected the split, people who witnessed that exchange said.

Along with offshore wind, ACP’s membership includes companies that develop solar, battery and onshore wind projects. The group’s board feared that a legal battle over offshore wind could cost the broader industry support from moderate Republican lawmakers who could defend the clean energy tax credits in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

That support yielded mixed results. Moderate Republicans in the Senate helped defeat a plan by conservatives to impose an excise tax on renewable energy projects, but agreed to the Trump budget law’s rapid phase-out of the IRA tax credits.

Offshore wind companies were also divided over how to respond to Trump.

One developer, Ocean Winds, filed court paperwork supporting a lawsuit by 17 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia challenging the president’s permitting freeze. The company said it had spent $600 million developing its SouthCoast Wind project off Massachusetts and called the freeze part of the administration’s attempt “to dismantle the entire offshore wind industry.”

But most companies with projects under construction sought to avoid direct confrontation with Trump. Too much money had been invested, they reasoned, to risk the administration shutting down a project.

Even after Interior shut down Empire Wind, a 54-turbine project south of Long Island, Equinor chose to negotiate with the administration. The strategy reflected Equinor’s desire to protect its extensive oil and gas holdings on federal lands in the U.S., and its unique ownership structure. The company’s largest shareholder is the Norwegian government, meaning it can call on lobbying firepower few other firms can match.

Norwegian Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg, a former secretary general of NATO, raised the stoppage with American officials when he visited the White House in April.

But most of all, Equinor had strong backing from New York state, which could give Trump something he desperately wanted: a pair of new natural gas pipelines.

Trump lifted the order in May after claiming to strike a deal with Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to permit two gas pipelines in her state. Hochul denied any such bargain but said the state would permit pipeline projects that met its regulations. The state approved a first project last month.

A trip with consequences

The decision to halt Empire Wind was one of the first signs that the wind policies of Trump’s second term would be dramatically different from those of his first. But the administration’s efforts reached new heights over the summer after Trump traveled to Scotland for a diplomatic summit with European leaders.

The trip included a stop at Aberdeenshire, the site of one of Trump’s Scottish golf courses. Nearly a dozen offshore wind turbines tower on the horizon, a visual reminder of the unsuccessful decade-long campaign Trump waged before he was president to prevent their construction.

“Windmills are a disgrace,” Trump told reporters during the trip. “They hurt everything they touch.”

When the president got home, a regulatory blitz followed.

Within a month, Interior issued regulations rescinding designated wind energy areas on the Outer Continental Shelf and announced its intention to pull back permits for three projects that had yet to start construction. The Commerce Department opened its tariff investigation into imported wind components. The Department of Transportation canceled $679 million in grants intended to aid the sector’s development. The Energy Department withdrew a conditional $716 million loan for offshore transmission development in New Jersey.

The flurry was capped off by Interior’s August decision to halt work on Revolution Wind.

“He got back from Scotland. It reminded him how much he hated these windmills and he asked why the hell they haven’t been shut down yet,” said one of the people familiar with the White House’s deliberations.

For all the conflict, the three people in the industry said they see a growing appreciation within the White House and Interior that it would be time consuming, bruising and potentially unsuccessful to fight projects that have started construction. Those disputes could detract from advancing the administration’s other priorities, such as promoting offshore oil and gas development and deep-sea mining.

Even if he lets a few wind farms go forward, the president could still claim a political victory by saying he has stopped more from being built, said the person familiar with the White House’s deliberations. But for Trump, a more visceral factor could prove more important.

“He really just hates wind,” the person said.

The details: A new consumer survey by the insights company EY reveals that half of global car buyers plan to choose internal combustion engines, a 13-point jump as demand for electric vehicles softens.

50% of global car buyers intend to purchase an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle in the next 24 months, an increase of 13 points from 2024.

Battery electric vehicle (BEV) preference has fallen to 14%, a drop of 10 percentage points, and hybrid preference has declined to 16%, down five percentage points.

51% of prospective EV buyers say their plans remain unchanged, but 36% are reconsidering or delaying purchases due to geopolitical developments.

Regionally, the percentage of consumers who indicated that they want to buy an ICE vehicle rose by 12 points in the Americas, 11 points in Europe, and 10 points in the Asia-Pacific (APAC), while BEV intent fell across all major markets—with range anxiety being the top consumer deterrent for purchasing an EV.

Why it matters: Stores that match ICE, hybrid, and BEV offerings to local price sensitivity, infrastructure, and policy, will be better positioned to keep turns and margins healthy as shopper interest shifts back toward traditional powertrains.

Between the lines: EY’s report comes amid mounting industry support for ICE vehicles across the globe.

President Trump announced last week that he will gut tighter U.S. emission standards that would have led to an expected fleetwide average of about 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031.

Trump’s move drew immediate support from Detroit automakers Ford, Stellantis, and General Motors, who have been raising concerns for months about the challenges to meet the standards.

Automakers in Europe are pushing the European Commission to ease its emissions standards on new vehicles—with the EU now indicating that it will fast-track its planned review of a 2035 internal combustion ban.

What they’re saying: “Consumers are weighing the realities of policy shifts, cost pressures and uneven charging infrastructure,” said Constantin M. Gall, EY Global Aerospace, Defense and Mobility Leader, per a press statement. “The long-term trend appears to be a shift away from a purely electric (‘E-only’) approach toward a more diversified future for vehicle powertrains, with different vehicle technologies serving different customer needs.”

Bottom line: A mixed powertrain future is here to stay.

On the other hand, blue states saw huge increases in environmental protection funding and staffing.","TALLAHASSEE — Florida cut more environmental protection jobs than any other state in the past 15 years, despite the challenges posed by increasingly intense hurricanes and sea level rise, according to a newly released national report.

The state cut 394 jobs, or 19% of full-time positions, at the Florida Department of Environmental Protection from 2010 to 2024, according to the Environmental Impact Project’s latest report, released Wednesday.

Florida also saw environmental spending cut by 7% during that same time frame.

“This has a huge impact on Florida’s ability to protect and preserve our state’s unique and iconic natural environment, not to mention preventing toxic pollution from impacting public health,” said Susannah Randolph, Sierra Club Florida chapter director, in response to the report. “Budgets are reflections of priorities. If protecting Florida’s environment and public health is a priority, it would be funded, not cut.”

The cuts reflect policy changes in the state under two Republican governors, Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis.

The report’s authors say 27 states made budget cuts to their environmental protection agencies. That is a worrisome trend, they argue, when the Trump administration wants to make deep cuts to the federal Environmental Protection Agency with the idea states can take over those oversight duties.

“Instead of fulfilling their responsibilities to protect residents, too many states like Florida are leaving a vacuum of leadership, which is leaving communities vulnerable to deadly pollution,” said Drew Ball, southeast campaigns director for the National Resource Defense Council, in a statement released along with the report.

Florida has emphasized spending money on restoring the Everglades and opposing offshore drilling, but it has been criticized for cutting back on enforcement and inspections, rolling back regulations and de-emphasizing the impacts of climate change even as the state has been battered by severe storms that caused record flooding.

“Opposing offshore drilling and supporting funding for the Everglades are important but without protection of our rivers, springs, wildlife, and wild spaces, those efforts will ultimately be undermined,” Randolph said. “Everything is connected.”

The DEP did not provide a comment for this story.

In 2024, DeSantis signed a bill eliminating most references to climate change from state law, reversing 16 years of policy with new legislation that critics say also undermined efforts to develop alternative energy sources.

Around the same time, the state advised textbook authors that they would have to remove references to the phrase “climate change” or their books would be rejected for use in Florida’s public schools. They were also told to include citations to back up statements that “human activity” caused climate change and cut a “political statement” urging governments to take action to stop climate change.

Also, in August of that year, many Floridians raised alarm bells when DEP plans, leaked to the press, showed the agency was considering “The Great Outdoor initiative,” which called for large-scale commercial development — hotels, golf courses and pickleball courts — within several state parks. It was scuttled in the face of public outcry, and DeSantis signed a bill this year prohibiting golf courses and resorts in state parks.

“After last year’s massive statewide protests calling for protection of our state parks, it doesn’t take much to see that Florida voters of all walks of life want environmental protection prioritized,” Randolph said.

Roughly two-thirds of the states cut 3,725 jobs from 2010 to 2024, the report found. While Florida had the largest number of jobs eliminated, dropping DEP’s full-time workforce from 2,096 to 1,702, the highest percentage of cuts were made by North Carolina at 32%, Connecticut at 36%, Arizona at 25% and Louisiana at 24%.

Seven states steeply reduced their pollution control budgets — including Texas, with its rapidly growing oil and gas industry — when adjusted for inflation. Mississippi led with 71%, followed by South Dakota with 61% and Connecticut at 51%.

Not all the cuts broke neatly along political lines. Connecticut, New York and Illinois are strong Democrat enclaves that saw double-digit cuts in environmental protection budgets.

But seven of the 10 states with the largest percent cuts to their environmental agencies had Republican governors for most of those 15 years.

On the other hand, blue states saw huge increases in environmental protection funding and staffing. California grew its budget by more than 350% while its greenhouse gas emissions fell and its economic productivity grew, the report said. Colorado and Vermont each increased their environmental spending by more than 100%.

Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said enforcement of environmental regulations depend on robust state agencies “that have the resources they need to do their jobs.” The cuts documented by the study and more cuts at the federal level “will only put more Americans at risk.”",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TOS-L-wekiva-island-boat-tour-01.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-11 11:01:54.062824

At the state level, leaders do not have the luxury of stalemate. We must deliver. Governors embody the politics of problem solving, and that spirit is urgently needed across the nation.

The shutdown stands in stark contrast to how governors handle disagreement. The recent debate surrounding the National Guard reminds us that even among governors, disagreement can arise when state and federal responsibilities intersect.

While some states welcomed the deployment of National Guard units to their cities, others vigorously objected to National Guard action without a governor’s assent. Others viewed it as a complicated legal issue best suited for the court system.

This conversation underscores why the principled leadership of state governors matters. At a high level, we recognize the president has the authority to use the National Guard. At the same time, many governors of both parties share deep concerns about actions that threaten state autonomy.

The National Governors Association, where I am acting executive director and CEO, has always stood for the sovereignty of states as protected by the 10th Amendment.

Moments like this show that even when governors differ on process or principle, they share a deeper commitment to problem solving. Governors have not let disagreement stand in the way of progress. In the past few months, governors have worked together on policy recommendations that could shape the next major congressional breakthroughs.

Take permitting reform. In Congress, both sides of the aisle agree it’s unacceptable that the United States is one of the slowest nations in the developed world at greenlighting new energy projects. Yet permitting reform has stalled.

So governors from both parties formed a working group to hash it out. Led by National Governors Association chair, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R), and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), 13 governors collaborated to develop a package of permitting reform priorities.

These proposals aren’t vague platitudes. They’re detailed, comprehensive and — crucially — bipartisan.

The governors submitted the policies to Congress in October. They quickly won the endorsement of the congressional Problem Solvers Caucus, vice president of the energy program at Bipartisan Policy Center and energy groups such as the American Petroleum Institute, ClearPath Action and the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America.

Governors have also united to combat the growing security threat posed by malicious drones.

Led by North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein (D) and Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry (R), more than 30 governors wrote a letter to Congress detailing dangerous drone intrusions over sensitive infrastructure and sporting events, and calling for the authority and resources needed to protect their states.

This kind of behind-the-scenes collaboration usually doesn’t make headlines, so governors have stepped in front of cameras together to publicly model constructive dialogue through the Disagree Better campaign. At the same time, they are deliberately pursuing policies to bring their communities together in the same way.

One of the more creative solutions centers on service opportunities. Governors are driving renewal around national service as a balm against political polarization. After Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) moved to institute a statewide service year option, other states, like Utah and Delaware, followed.

Governors understand that the path to renewing our politics runs through the communities in our states where people of all backgrounds still come together to advance our nation. As toxic polarization leads the nation down a dangerous path, bridging the political divide is more important than ever.

Governors spoke as one against political violence following the following the shooting of National Guard members in November, the murder of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk in September, the June assassination of Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, and the April arson attack that damaged Gov. Shapiro’s residence in Pennsylvania.

It’s an alarming sign of the times that these incidents all happened within a few months. In these times, I pledge that the National Governor’s Association will lead with constructive dialogue, uphold dignity in our discourse and keep the table open for honest political debate.

We must resist the pull of cynicism and hold space for tough conversations, while maintaining relentless focus on what unites us. In a time of deep division, it must do so again.

Because when governors work together, America works better.

The new Energy Engineered in the UK programme from the government aims to tackle the component shortages slowing offshore wind and grid expansion, including blades, turbines, transmission cables and converter stations. A huge section of this plan is a £300 million Supply Chain Fund for offshore wind and network infrastructure, designed to help manufacturers expand, build new facilities and also clear the bottlenecks that are currently leaving developers waiting a long time for critical equipment.

GB Energy stated that the aim is to attract large scale investment into Britain and anchor the programme within the government’s modern Industrial Strategy. It also aligns with the country’s 10 year mission to boost investment, create skilled jobs and make the UK one of the world’s best locations for building clean energy hardware.

To deliver this, GB Energy will partner with the National Wealth Fund, the Scottish National Infrastructure Bank and The Crown Estate to generate the finance for major manufacturing projects and provide investors with the certainty needed to back long term capacity. Another core pillar of the programme focuses on deep water wind. GB Energy will be launching a new commercialisation initiative with FLOWEX to secure a UK lead in floating offshore wind, the next major phase of North Sea deployment, mapping a pathway to scale up foundations and give manufacturers the predictable demand required to run factories at full tilt.

GB Energy CEO Dan McGrail said: “Great British Energy is investing in British industry, we are helping to create jobs, driving innovation and ensuring clean energy infrastructure is built here in the UK. This programme is about more than funding; it will help overcome the current challenges and ensure the benefits of a world class supply chain are felt in communities across the country.”

With £300 million already flowing into supply chains and another £700 million set to follow next year, GB Energy’s plan marks a decisive turning point that Britain no longer intends merely to install clean energy infrastructure, it intends to build it. This momentum reflects a broader global shift and the Renewable Energy Institute welcomes the growing investment in clean energy both in the UK and worldwide, signalling real progress in the transition to a cleaner energy future.

Texas has become a major hub of the Bitcoin mining industry, and the state government has even purchased $5 million of Bitcoin.
However, as the industry has grown, so too have concerns among residents and state lawmakers over rising demand on the power grid.
On average, each of the 22 cryptocurrency mines consumed over 668,000 megawatt hours of electricity last year.
In Texas, Bitcoin mines can rake in millions by enrolling in ERCOT programs to cut their energy use when demand spikes.","A Straight Arrow News investigation found that in 2024, large cryptocurrency operations in Texas consumed more electricity mining virtual currencies such as Bitcoin than residential utility customers in the cities of San Antonio and El Paso combined. The footprint of crypto mines is expected to keep growing in the coming years.

As of mid-November, 22 cryptocurrency mining facilities had registered with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas. In 2024, those facilities combined to consume more than 14.7 million megawatt hours of electricity, according to public records obtained by SAN. That corresponds to about 3% of all electricity produced on the state’s power grid in 2024.

The cryptocurrency mines consumed enough electricity to power more than a million Texas homes for a year. Insiders from the Bitcoin industry told SAN it is misleading to compare their electricity consumption to Texas cities because cryptocurrency mines turn off when electricity prices are high. But not all electricity market analysts outside the cryptomining industry are convinced; some said Bitcoin is a factor in rising consumer prices.

Texas has become a major hub of the Bitcoin mining industry, and the state government has even purchased $5 million of Bitcoin. The energy-intensive process uses computers to guess a random string of numbers, which verifies a set of virtual currency transactions, known as a block. It’s a lucrative business: For each block of transactions a mining company correctly verifies, it earns a reward of 3.125 Bitcoin. However, as the industry has grown, so too have concerns among residents and state lawmakers over rising demand on the power grid.

How much electricity does Bitcoin mining use?

The U.S. Energy Information Administration tracks annual retail electricity sales by utility companies across the country.

In 2024, San Antonio’s city-owned utility CPS Energy sold over 11.1 million megawatt hours of electricity to 865,914 homes, according to the EIA data. El Paso Electric, which serves the city of El Paso and parts of southeast New Mexico, sold about 2.7 million megawatt hours of electricity to 312,576 residential customers.

SAN’s analysis found that the amount of electricity consumed by cryptocurrency mines is equal to residential utility customers in the city of San Antonio, the El Paso area and another mid-sized Texas city, such as Garland, where residents consumed over 908,000 megawatt hours of electricity in 2024.

On average, each of the 22 cryptocurrency mines consumed over 668,000 megawatt hours of electricity last year.

While megawatt hours measure how much electricity is consumed over time, megawatts show how much power a facility can consume in an instant. The cryptomining industry has increased how much power it can draw from the grid at once. In the next two years, it’s expected to rise another 20%.

In June 2024, a senior vice president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas told lawmakers that cryptocurrency mining could draw an estimated 2,600 megawatts of power from the grid. As of November 2025, the electric demand of cryptocurrency mines is 4,288 megawatts and is expected to surpass 5,300 megawatts by 2027.

Where is the data from?

The Texas legislature passed Senate Bill 1929 in 2023, requiring virtual currency mining operations with a capacity of 75 megawatts or more to file registration forms with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUC). Following its passage, a SAN reporter was the first among several media organizations to request copies of the filings via the Texas Public Information Act.

The PUC denied the request, arguing that public disclosure of the size and location of cryptocurrency mines could be used by terrorists to attack critical infrastructure. But the Texas Attorney General’s office largely sided with the journalists, triggering a lawsuit between the PUC and the attorney general. Litigation is ongoing.

SAN filed another public records request seeking totals from all registered facilities, foregoing information on specific cryptocurrency mines or companies. That request yielded the electricity consumption data reported in this investigation.

The total capacity of cryptocurrency mines and their annual electricity consumption is likely somewhat higher than the available data, which only tracks facilities that can draw at least 75 megawatts from the grid.

While the PUC data includes 22 mines above 75 megawatts that have registered with the agency, a report from the Texas Observer found 60 cryptocurrency mines spread across 33 Texas counties.

As part of this investigation, SAN contacted several of the largest known cryptocurrency companies in the state, including Riot Platforms and MARA, formerly Marathon Digital Holdings. None responded to multiple requests for comment.

How does it impact the grid?

Daniel Batten, a Bitcoin investor and advisory board member for MARA, told SAN that without context, the comparison of Bitcoin mining consumption to various Texas cities is “highly misleading.”

“Bitcoin mining is by economic necessity a non-rival consumer of energy,” Batten said.

Cryptocurrency mining is “flexible” and can turn its energy consumption up or down depending on economic factors, given the price of electricity and the price of Bitcoin.

Through this flexible operation, Batten said cryptocurrency mines “not only help stabilize the grid, they also provide additional revenue for renewable energy operators, which has been shown to accelerate the green energy transition.”

Spencer Marr, co-founder and president at Sangha Renewables, a company launching a 20-megawatt Bitcoin mine that will consume excess solar power behind-the-meter at a facility near Odessa, said “Bitcoin mining operations tend to concentrate where there is an oversupply of power.”

Some studies have shown that cryptocurrency mining can incentivize renewable energy development, while others have demonstrated the potential for large flexible loads to help stabilize the grid. In Texas, Bitcoin mines can rake in millions by enrolling in ERCOT programs to cut their energy use when demand spikes.

Critics, however, view those programs, which pay cryptocurrency companies a premium to participate, as exploitative rather than beneficial. Very little real-world data exists to demonstrate the extent of voluntary cuts to power consumption outside of organized ERCOT demand response programs.

“As the Nobel-winning conservative economist Milton Friedman said, ‘There is no such thing as a free lunch.’ That applies to cryptocurrency miners on the ERCOT grid,” said Ed Hirs, an energy economist and lecturer at the University of Houston. “Any cryptocurrency miners on ERCOT using electricity are market demand over and above that of regular Texans.”

Hirs told SAN that without Bitcoin on the grid, overall electricity demand would be lower, as would reliance on some of the power plants that currently operate day in and day out.

“Any cryptocurrency miners on ERCOT using electricity are market demand over and above that of regular Texans,” he said.

Daniel Cohan, a professor at Rice University who has researched energy policy, said the electricity consumption data shows crypto mines are “likely propping up wholesale prices and natural gas use on mild days.”

Cohan said more precise data would be needed to estimate the exact price impact for consumers.

While some Bitcoin companies like Sangha Renewables are co-located with solar power, others like MARA’s facility in Hood County are co-located with natural gas power plants.

In response to SAN’s findings, Mandy DeRoche, a deputy managing attorney for the Clean Energy Program at the nonprofit Earthjustice said, “Bitcoin mining companies are continuing to exploit the system for their profit.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Texas-Bitcoin-Mining-FI-v5.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:02:33.267836

Indeed, resentment for data center development is becoming so widespread that it’s now one of the few issues that both Democrats and Republicans can agree on.","(Oil Price) – For farmers in the United States, concerns about too much clean energy production are quickly transforming into concerns about too little energy to go around. For years, rural America has been pushing back against the spread of utility-scale solar and wind farms competing for agricultural land. Now, they have a new sector to worry about as massive data center developments look to set up shop across the country, competing for land, energy, and water resources.

AI integration is becoming ubiquitous, with virtually no market sector untouched by its rapid spread. In October, Nvidia – the company that makes the advanced computer chips that power many machine learning platforms – became the first company to achieve $5 trillion in valuation. To put into perspective just how massive that number is, it’s higher than the entire gross domestic product of Germany, Europe’s largest economy.

The scale of this global transformation is hard to overstate, and is being felt in even the most unlikely of places, from Silicon Valley to the American heartland. In the rural United States, farmers are becoming increasingly worried about how developments in Big Tech could impact their daily operations, especially when it comes to energy prices, which are already soaring.

“As we see some of these big power users wanting to come into the state of Illinois, like data centers and those types of things, there’s some concern by our membership that there’s going to be an over-demand on power,” says Kevin Semlow, director of governmental affairs and commodities with the Illinois Farm Bureau. “As you see demand go up and supply stays the same, what changes? It’s the price.”

In an interview with agricultural news outlet Brownfield, Semlow went on to say, “Our members are concerned that as we see these higher-use facilities come in, we’re going to see prices increase, which then of course has a great impact on the bottom line.”

Farmers aren’t the only ones worried about footing the bill for AI’s massive energy needs. Many residents living in states that have welcomed data center development, like Virginia, are already experiencing a utility bill crisis. “We are witnessing a massive transfer of wealth from residential utility customers to large corporations—data centers and large utilities and their corporate parents, which profit from building additional energy infrastructure,” Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp told Business Insider back in July. “Utility regulation is failing to protect residential customers, contributing to an energy affordability crisis.”

And energy prices aren’t the only concern. Data centers are also major water-consumers. In 2014, U.S. data centers used 5.6 billion gallons of water. By 2023, that had tripled to 17.4 billion gallons – and that number is going to keep rising at a rapid pace. Considering how essential water resources are for agriculture, and that agricultural demand is already placing undue stress on scarce water resources, added competition from data centers is on track to become a major concern, especially in drier climates. Even in climates with abundant freshwater sources, activists warn that these competing interests could cause shortages. A recent report from Sentient cautions that “without intervention, the Great Lakes could be strained past their limit.”

Moreover, data center developments are snapping up a lot of land in rural and agricultural zones, sparking pushback from local communities. In Indiana earlier this year, local residents won out in a heated battle against Google, which wanted to convert more than 450 acres in an Indianapolis suburb into a massive data center campus. “When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents,” NPR reported.

Still, it’s not certain that all the planned data centers will come to fruition should the supply of data center services exceed demand, said Alex Bomstein, executive director of Clean Air Council.","Twenty years after fracking began to boost natural gas production in western Pennsylvania, residents are bracing for another surge in output as gas-fired power plants prepare to meet a big jump in electricity demand. At least five new energy-hungry data centers are planned in the region, most of which will power themselves by producing electricity by burning natural gas on site. The burst in activity is prompting predictions, by power companies as well as their critics, of drilling hundreds or even thousands of new gas wells to fuel the centers’ power demands.

While the gas industry welcomes new users for western Pennsylvania’s abundant natural gas, critics fear that higher production will add to the industry’s pollution of air and drinking water and heighten risks to public health. And in places where these data centers draw power from the grid, ratepayers are concerned about sharing the higher costs stemming from increased demand and upgrading transmission lines to carry additional power.

“The reflexive response is always ‘drill more,’ so I think the likelihood is that you are going to see increases in drilling” as these projects move closer to reality, said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy and a former secretary of Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).

The Homer City facility, built on the site of a former coal-burning power plant, will be the largest gas-fired plant in the U.S.

By far the biggest power plant planned for western Pennsylvania’s data center industry is in Indiana County’s Homer City, some 50 miles east of Pittsburgh. There, developers plan to convert the Homer City Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant that was shut down two years ago, to a seven-turbine gas-fired plant that would eventually produce 4.4 gigawatts of electricity — double the generation capacity of the former coal plant. (One gigawatt can power between 300,000 and 750,000 homes a year, according to industry and government estimates.) When fully operational it will be the largest gas-fired plant in the United States.

Designed to power multiple data centers on a 3,200-acre “energy campus,” the Homer City facility, which is scheduled to start operating in 2027, would generate all its own power rather than drawing on the grid, said a spokesperson for the developer, Homer City Redevelopment. Once its data center demand is met, it would feed electricity back into the grid, potentially meeting the needs of “thousands” of nearby homes, according to the spokesperson.

On November 18, Pennsylvania’s DEP issued the project an air-quality permit, prompting condemnation from air-quality advocates. The state government “has fallen in line across the aisle to support [the] rapid buildout of AI infrastructure, even though the new power plants being proposed to run data centers in Pennsylvania are almost universally plants that would burn methane from local fracking wells,” the Clean Air Council, an advocacy group, said in a statement.

Corey Hessen, chief executive of Homer City Generation, said the project will be in “full compliance” with state air-quality regulations. The permit allows the Homer City power plant to emit two kinds of particulate matter, which can cause heart and lung illnesses, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxide, and sulfuric acid, in addition to carbon dioxide.

According to the Clean Air Council, the Homer City data center facility would produce 17 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to burning 18 billion pounds of coal or 39 million barrels of oil, while its annual energy consumption would be equivalent to that used by 3.2 million homes.

In Upper Burrell Township, in Westmoreland County, TecFusions, a global data center operator, is planning a project on 1,395 acres, powered by up to 3 gigawatts of gas-fired power generated on site. “This approach ensures reliability, efficiency, and reduced dependency on increasingly costly utility power,” according to a company statement.

And in Springdale, in Allegheny County, a proposed 565,000-square-foot data center on the site of the former Cheswick coal-fired power plant would use 180 megawatts of electricity drawn from the grid. The project has drawn protests from ratepayers who fear it will lead to higher residential electric bills if more capacity is required to meet the new power demand, in addition to generating more air and water pollution from power plant operations and from increased fracking.

As fracking expands to meet data center power needs, “conditions will get worse for the people of western Pennsylvania,” says a researcher.

Such concerns are not new in western Pennsylvania. For the last two decades, environmental advocates and researchers have accused the natural gas industry of polluting the air, polluting water through leaks and spills of chemicals used in fracking, and causing illnesses including cancer, asthma, and birth defects. The harms of fracking have been documented in a “compendium” of some 2,300 peer-reviewed studies from around the world published by the nonprofits Physicians for Social Responsibility and Concerned Health Professionals of New York. The Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade group, maintains that fracking for natural gas in Pennsylvania is safe, and that by replacing coal-fired generation it was responsible for a nearly 11 percent decline in the state’s carbon dioxide emissions between 2022 and 2023.

Such industry statements do not reassure Liz Pebley, a 68-year-old resident of Freeport Township, in southwest Pennsylvania. She is particularly concerned about water quality and quantity as more wells are fracked. In June of 2022, a leak of drilling fluids — called a frac-out — from a gas well contaminated her well water with high levels of methane and heavy metals, including arsenic and barium. The well was operated by EQT, which will be supplying the Homer City plant with gas. Pebley said her water was discolored and smelled foul. In 2023, the company supplied her with a 550-gallon “water buffalo,” a plastic tank that still sits outside her house and remains her sole source of clean water. John Stolz, a Duquesne University professor and longtime critic of the gas industry who studied the EQT frac-out, estimates that the water of 50 other people was similarly contaminated.

“Unconventional oil and gas development has led to the loss of water resources not just at the front end, with removal, but also contaminating aquifers to the point where communities have lost their potable water,” said Stolz. As fracking expands to meet data center power needs, he added, “conditions will get worse for the people of western Pennsylvania.”

Despite scientists’ and activists’ concerns, only one western Pennsylvania municipality has proposed an ordinance to protect itself from data centers and their demand for electricity. Union Township in Washington County, a heavily fracked area south of Pittsburgh, wants power companies to certify that the grid can meet data center demand while ensuring supplies to existing and future homes and businesses; it also wants water suppliers to certify they have the capacity to meet the demands of the proposed facility while maintaining “sufficient levels of service” to existing ratepayers. To encourage other townships to pass protective measures, the environmental group PennFuture has published a model ordinance that includes similar requirements for electrical capacity and water supply.

The planned data center boom represents the latest attempt by the gas industry to find new uses for this vast resource.

The largest grid operator in the country, PJM Interconnection, which serves Pennsylvania and other mid-Atlantic states, is struggling to keep up with data center expansion. In late November, PJM’s independent market monitor, a watchdog for the operator’s wholesale energy markets, asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to prevent PJM from adding data centers to the grid unless existing customers can be reliably served.

The Marcellus Shale, which underlies about two-thirds of Pennsylvania, has been producing natural gas using hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling since 2004. Stolz estimates it still contains about 250 trillion cubic feet of gas. That’s about half of the 489 trillion cubic feet estimated in 2009 by former Penn State University professor Terry Engelder in landmark research that kick-started the state’s gas fracking industry. In 2024, the United States as a whole consumed about 33 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while exporting 7.7 trillion cubic feet.

The planned data center boom represents the latest attempt by the gas industry to find new uses for this vast resource. In recent years there had been a push to make southwest Pennsylvania a petrochemical and plastics hub that would be dependent on fracked gas. But only one such facility has been built and is operating — the Shell ethane cracker plant in the town of Monaca.

Matt Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Collaborative, a nonprofit that advocates for clean air in the Pittsburgh region, said that a surge in gas production to fuel data centers threatens to reverse a recent improvement in regional air quality that has been helped by the retirement of most coal-fired power plants. “Our air quality, even though it’s on a positive trend at the moment, can be put back on a negative trend, and we can be out of attainment [with federal air quality standards] because of these choices that are being made about building gas-fired power plants,” he said.

Still, it’s not certain that all the planned data centers will come to fruition should the supply of data center services exceed demand, said Alex Bomstein, executive director of Clean Air Council. “There is a giant data-center bubble that we’re living through right now where an enormous number of projects don’t necessarily have customers,” he said. “We don’t know which ones are going to materialize and which are going to disappear into the ether.”

David Hess, a former DEP secretary who currently edits an environmental newsletter, believes other factors besides the boom in data centers will lead to an increase in gas production. He forecasts it will also be driven by an increase in U.S. liquefied natural gas exports being championed by the Trump administration and by the Northeast Supply Enhancement Project, a planned pipeline that would move the fuel from Pennsylvania to New Jersey and New York City.

“There is no doubt all three will drive more drilling and more gas infrastructure development in Pennsylvania,” Hess said, “with all its documented negative impacts on public health and the environment.”",https://yale-threesixty.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/CNX-Drilling_Getty-HEADER.jpg?w=1200&q=60&auto=format&fit=max&dm=1765399012&s=3f3f311a95c826f600993a1c7977c5c8,N,,2025-12-11 11:01:47.031574

The company has shifted focus toward internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, including a to expand F-Series production, while also pursuing cost-effective lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology for its upcoming midsize electric pickup. For SK On, the split is a strategic move to reduce debt and fixed costs. , the company lacks viable LFP technology for automotive use. The company is pivoting toward energy storage systems (ESS) and partnerships with other automakers, including Hyundai, Kia, and Volkswagen. , SK On and Ford have agreed to reduce their joint venture's capital by 4.9 trillion won to return funds to shareholders, signaling a financial restructuring aimed at optimizing balance sheets.

Operational Adjustments: Facility Repurposing and Supply Chain Reallocation

Operationally, the dissolution has led to a reassignment of BlueOval SK's three U.S. battery plants. SK On will assume full control of the Tennessee facility, which it plans to

, while Ford retains ownership of the two Kentucky plants. This division allows Ford to maintain a domestic battery supply chain while avoiding the complexities of SK On's LFP technology gap.

Ford's retained Kentucky facilities are being repositioned to serve a broader customer base.

, which began production in August 2025, is now exploring partnerships with energy storage firms and other automakers to utilize excess capacity. Meanwhile, Ford's in the Louisville Assembly Plant will focus on a midsize electric pickup, leveraging LFP batteries produced at a Michigan factory. This shift aligns with of a ""Model T moment"" in EV manufacturing, emphasizing affordability and scalability.

Strategic Repurposing: Energy Storage and New Partnerships

SK On's pivot to ESS is gaining momentum. The company has secured a 7.2 GWh battery storage supply deal with Flatiron Energy, with deliveries starting in late 2026. To meet this demand, SK On is repurposing EV battery production lines in Georgia and planning LFP production in South Korea. This move not only diversifies SK On's revenue streams but also positions it to

.

Ford, meanwhile, is leveraging its retained Kentucky facilities to strengthen its domestic supply chain. The company's Universal EV Platform and ""assembly tree"" production model aim to reduce costs by 20% in parts and 40% in workstations. By focusing on LFP batteries, Ford is addressing cost concerns while maintaining flexibility to adapt to market demands.

Conclusion: Lessons for Investors

The Ford-SK On dissolution highlights the volatility of the EV market and the importance of strategic agility. For Ford, the shift to ICE and LFP technology reflects a pragmatic approach to profitability amid uncertain demand. For SK On, the pivot to ESS and partnerships with other automakers demonstrates a commitment to long-term growth in a competitive landscape. Investors should monitor how these companies navigate regulatory shifts, supply chain disruptions, and evolving consumer preferences. The repurposing of BlueOval SK's facilities and the emergence of new partnerships underscore the need for flexibility in capital allocation and technological innovation.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1765454721004.jpg.png,N,,2025-12-11 12:05:02.265864

That gives Western automakers a challenging task: proving they can beat China’s best.","China has taken the lead on electric vehicles, leaving the collective West in its dust. Its EVs have better performance, charge quicker and are cheaper to buy than Western alternatives, which makes them very compelling buys. But the West isn’t asleep at the wheel. Companies like BMW, Mercedes, Polestar and others are now releasing a new wave of EVs that are a true match to the best the People’s Republic has to offer.

We could call these new models Gen 3, since they are part of the third wave of EVs from the modern era and they all have certain things in common. They ride on advanced 800-volt bespoke EV platforms and fit into the software-defined vehicle category, promising to improve over time through successive over-the-air updates.

Several EVs from this new wave are either here or just around the corner, and they should make 2026 a much better year for EV enthusiasts.

How We Got To Gen 3

Photo by: Andrei Nedelea

Electric vehicles have been around for well over a century, with their first golden age lasting from the late 1890s until around the 1920s, when they started to disappear. The modern wave of EVs began after the year 2000, and it was only around 2010 that automakers started to take them seriously and began pouring more money into their development.

Cars like the first Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3, the Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive or the Ford Focus Electric can be considered Gen 1 EVs. They were mostly compliance vehicles that couldn’t travel far on a charge and even bespoke models like the Leaf or i3 were still compromised by their small batteries and slow charging.

The Gen 1 era lasted from 2010 until around 2018, when most automakers began making what we would define as Gen 2 EVs (cars like the BMW i4, the Mercedes EQE and EQS or the Ford Mustang Mach-E). These cars were far more usable thanks to their much larger batteries and faster charging, but they were still plagued by software issues and reflected legacy automakers’ inexperience with EVs.

During that era, Tesla offered the best EV experience by far, thanks in no small part to the existence of its expansive network of Supercharger stations, but also the cars themselves, which were superior to any EV rival for many years straight. The company's software-defined approach would eventually be copied by Western rivals, but it was Chinese automakers who took note first. This eventually ended up giving Chinese automakers the EV lead they have today, as they improved upon Tesla's formula and left the rest of the West behind.

So even though Western Gen 2 EVs were finally usable enough through their increased range and faster charging to compete with gas cars, they still had plenty of compromises that could potentially make buyers wary of switching to electric. Many Gen 2 EVs are still on sale today, but we’re also at the start of the third generation of EVs. Manufacturers are applying the hard-learned lessons of their first decade of EV production, launching products with better technology, more compelling designs and far more efficient powertrains. Gen 3 is when EVs finally seem like they have reached maturity.

The Gen 3 Recipe

Photo by: BMW

The recipe for what we would define as a “Gen 3” EV is simple. The first thing is that it needs to be built on a bespoke EV platform running at 800 volts or higher. This higher voltage has a whole suite of advantages, the biggest being higher power, quicker charging (the fastest-charging EVs all run at 800 volts or higher) and improved running efficiency.

Running at 800 volts also allows manufacturers to lower the amperage of the current running through the vehicle, reducing heat and allowing all of the wires and cables inside the system to be thinner, cheaper and lighter. Thermal management of larger components is easier, too, due to the decrease in electrical resistance.

The cost to build an 800-volt EV is higher than for a 400-volt EV, so buyers will have to pay more for one of these higher-voltage EVs. Cost is also the reason behind BYD’s decision not to bring its 800-volt EVs to Europe yet, although they are surely coming, given the increased competition from local players.

The other key pillar of a Gen 3 EV is that it has to be a software-defined vehicle or SDV. This means the mechanical side of things fades in importance behind the software that runs it. Software controls how the vehicle feels and drives and it can completely change how you perceive it without touching any of the hardware.

SDVs are seen as more future-proof since they can be kept up to date with over-the-air updates in a way that traditional cars can’t. One way to oversimplify things is to say that an SDV is like a smartphone on wheels. That’s not necessarily accurate, but it does paint a good picture of what these new cars are like and what we can expect from them.

Why China Pulled Ahead

Photo by: Andrei Nedelea

China makes some of the world’s most advanced EVs today and its automakers experienced much quicker progress than their Western counterparts. They offer superior performance—one Chinese EV has 3,000 horsepower and is the fastest around the Nurburgring—and are considerably more advanced when it comes to charging, with some exceeding the one megawatt mark.

They are also able to make these EVs considerably cheaper than Western automakers, so much so that they can still sell them at a competitive price in Europe even with tariffs piled on top. Part of the reason is that Chinese automakers received significant government subsidies. Bodies like the European Union consider this an unfair advantage, which is why they imposed different import tariffs on Chinese EVs depending on the amount of state aid they received.

But even with tariffs, brands like BYD, Geely, SAIC or Chery are doing very well in Europe, even if not all their offerings fit into the Gen 3 category. Most already offer such vehicles in China, but they determined that bringing these new or updated models into Europe isn’t worth it right now, since older-tech EVs are still competitive against local rivals.

But now that the Europeans have finally caught up, Chinese automakers aren't invincible, though (many have already called it quits), and they will have to bring their A-game to the continent to maintain its momentum.

The Contenders

Photo by: Mercedes-Benz

The BMW iX3 was probably the most notable new Western electric vehicle launch of 2025, the first in the new Neue Klasse series of models. It ticks all the Gen 3 boxes, and it puts the West in a very good position against China.

Not only is the iX3 an 800-volt software-defined EV, but it also retains BMW’s renowned driving engagement and performance, and it’s extremely efficient too, as our own Tim Levin found when he drove it recently. It’s also innovative. Its wrap-around panoramic display sits under the edge of the windshield, leaving it somewhere between a traditional screen and a head-up display. It makes sitting in one of these cars feel fresh and futuristic but without feeling gimmicky.

The iX3 takes full advantage of its 800-volt platform, too, with new motors and more power-dense batteries that make it one of Europe’s longest-range EVs. Next year, when BMW launches the i3 sedan, it should use its electrons even more efficiently, giving cars like the BYD Seal or the Zeekr 007 a real European competitor.

Mercedes-Benz also has a Gen 3 midsize electric crossover on the way, the new GLC EV, as well as a sedan version, the C-Class EV, on the way. Both are built on a new 800-volt platform with a focus on efficiency and quick charging, although they don’t have the same outright peak charging power as the BMW iX3 or the Zeekr 7X.

There’s also the smaller Mercedes CLA EV, which boasts a different 800-volt platform and excellent efficiency. It too is defined by its software and features an advanced Google-based infotainment system, complete with an AI assistant that you can almost have a conversation with. Its party trick, though, is its impressive range for a vehicle in its size and price bracket.

If you want the same platform as in the CLA but in a taller package with a more cavernous interior, you can choose the new GLB with EQ Technology instead. It has the same 320 kW charging and even with its bulkier body, it should be more efficient than older EVs of its size.

The refreshed Polestar 3 also ticks all the Gen 3 boxes. After just a year on sale, the Polestar 3 is getting a big upgrade for 2026, including a new 800-volt platform, an upgraded central computer, and 350 kW fast charging. If you want the same underpinnings but in a more traditional SUV shape, then you can get the Volvo EX90 instead, since it’s basically the same vehicle underneath but with less of a focus on looking and feeling sporty.

Still, these manufacturers are playing catch-up to Porsche and Hyundai-Kia, whose EVs have had 800 volts for years now. Porsche’s latest EV, the new Cayenne Electric, takes charging power up to 400 kW. It features a structural battery pack and even features optional wireless charging, bringing Porsche one step closer to producing a true global EV.

Lucid is still an EV tech leader with its vehicles running closer to 900 volts for years, too, offering remarkable charging speeds, efficiency and range figures. Unlike some manufacturers like Kia, whose latest EVs have switched from 800 to 400 volts, Lucid’s future midsize models will likely keep their higher-voltage platform and eke out more of its benefits.

Honda will also soon offer its own Gen 3 EVs in the form of the strange-looking 0 Series, as well as with the Acura RSX. They do not feature an 800-volt architecture, but this shouldn’t hinder them too much.

Some carmakers say they just don’t see the need to go any higher than 400 volts in the foreseeable future, and this includes startups like Rivian, which is working on two new, smaller and more affordable models, the R2 and R3. Both will likely stick to 400 volts.

Some Gen 3 EVs are still a couple years away, like the Scout Terra and Traveler, as well as a new line of Rivian-powered Volkswagen EVs that should arrive around 2027. Ford’s “skunkworks” electric truck is also firmly in Gen 3 territory, even if the new modular EV platform it will be built on doesn’t support 800 volts.

Basically, all Western carmakers have either just launched Gen 3 EVs or plan to do so in the next year or two.

Not A Victory Lap

However, the seemingly renewed commitment by Western automakers to make better EVs doesn’t automatically translate to success. These vehicles still need to be desirable enough for customers to justify the price premium they typically command, especially when compared to Chinese competitors and Tesla’s compact models, which remain strong value propositions with their 400-volt platform.

Next year is when this battle of EV manufacturers looks set to go down, and it could go either way. For instance, BYD is expected to begin EV production at its new factory in Hungary, which should allow it to avoid tariffs, meaning it could sell EVs in Europe at a lower price than it does today, when everything it offers in Europe is imported from China and is subject to import duties.

BYD’s ascent in Europe shows that buyers on the continent are willing to overlook their bias for a certain local car brand and its products if another model (Chinese or otherwise) offers a better deal and is cheaper than what the local manufacturers are selling. That gives Western automakers a challenging task: proving they can beat China’s best. Next year, we’ll see if they can pull it off.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/nAqE4o/s1/2025-mercedes-benz-cla-first-drive.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 08:58:38.211479

This significant battery metals investment reflects the company's confidence in sustained market demand while positioning for continued global expansion. The bond structure supports both project construction and working capital replenishment across the company's expanding global operations.

How Does Corporate Bond Financing Shape Battery Industry Consolidation?

The global battery manufacturing sector increasingly relies on sophisticated debt financing structures to fund massive capacity expansion projects across multiple continents. Corporate bond issuances provide manufacturers with fixed-cost capital access while maintaining equity control during periods of intensive infrastructure development.

The financing announcement coincided with favourable interest rate environments, as the US Federal Reserve implemented a quarter-point rate cut to 3.5-3.75% on December 10, 2025. Lower global interest rates typically benefit capital-intensive corporations accessing international debt markets for expansion funding.

Five-Year Bond Structure Analysis for Manufacturing Scale-Up

Five-year bond maturity provides battery manufacturers with strategic advantages for multi-phase facility construction timelines. This duration aligns with typical gigafactory development cycles, from initial site preparation through full production ramp-up periods.

Key Financial Metrics:

Bond Amount: $1.4 billion (10 billion yuan)

Maturity: Five-year structure

Purpose: Project construction and working capital

Market Context: 33.6% year-over-year growth in battery installations

Working capital allocation within bond proceeds enables manufacturers to maintain operational flexibility during facility ramp-up phases. Battery production requires substantial raw material inventory management, with lithium, nickel, and cobalt procurement representing significant upfront capital commitments.

Market Positioning Through Strategic Capital Deployment

Debt financing structures enable battery manufacturers to pursue aggressive expansion strategies without diluting existing shareholder equity positions. This approach proves particularly valuable when companies maintain strong market positions and seek to consolidate industry leadership.

,American Energy,2025-12-11 10:54:38+00:00,Nature,Ownership of power plants stranded by climate mitigation | Nature Sustainability,"Fofrich Navarro, Frances C, Steven J",,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01707-5,"Stranded coal assets in China and India are large primarily because these countries are operating relatively new power plants: in both countries, the capacity-averaged age of coal-burning power plants is <15 years (Fig.
Roughly 30% of CO2 emissions from coal plants are attributable to power plants owned by 10 companies (Fig.
Ownership of stranded gas-burning power plants is more evenly distributed, with 100 companies owning gas-fired generators that emit half the emissions from natural gas- and oil-burning power plants (Fig.
We omitted power plants from our calculations in the limited cases where the percentage of ownership was not listed within the data.
We quantify the concentration of company-level stranded assets using the HHI, calculated as the sum of the squared shares of stranded assets relative to the total stranded assets for each fuel type.","International climate goals to limit anthropogenic warming to 2 °C or less aim to avoid severe climate impacts on natural and human systems in the coming decades1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, but such goals entail a rapid reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by transitioning away from fossil sources of energy and fossil-fuel-burning power plants in particular11,12. Policies aligned with international climate targets will effectively impose higher costs on emitting infrastructure13,14, leaving the owners of fossil-fuel-burning power plants to adapt and transition away from high-carbon-emitting technologies, absorb substantial financial losses or pass related costs on to consumers. However, the magnitude and distribution of company-level financial risks in the global power sector have not been systematically evaluated, even though understanding such risks is crucial for accurately anticipating broader economic implications and allowing companies, investors and policy-makers to plan for and manage projected financial losses15,16,17,18. In this study, we assess stranded power-plant assets at the company level and by region with the hope of informing financial investors and energy-related decision-makers.

Previous research has shown that achieving ambitious climate goals requires the early retirement of fossil-fuel-burning power plants2,11,19,20 in the absence of retrofitting these plants with carbon capture technology, resulting in substantial forgone revenues. Other studies have estimated potential economic losses across the power sector13,14,21,22,23 or quantified stranded power-plant assets on a national level14,24, but most have not quantified the financial exposure of individual companies. For instance, ref. 24 calculated the proportion of operating fossil-fired electricity-generating capacity that exceeds climate-compatible levels under a 2 °C scenario and estimated stranded assets based on unrecovered capital costs from premature decommissioning. Similarly, ref. 25 quantified stranded assets using overnight capital costs and the unfulfilled portion of the expected lifetime of a coal plant under a 1.5 °C pathway. Meanwhile, ref. 14 estimated stranded assets in oil and gas production as the net present value of foregone profits under climate policy scenarios and aggregated from the asset level to firms and countries. In contrast, we evaluate foregone operating income of existing fossil-fuel-burning generators under carbon pricing estimates associated with lower climate policy scenarios, aggregate these losses to the company and identify and name companies with the largest financial exposure. While financial institutions, investors and policy-makers are generally aware of the financial risks associated with climate policies26,27, the scale and distribution of economic exposure among companies with emission-intensive power-plant assets is not clear. Therefore, this study assesses the financial implications of carbon pricing on fossil-fuel-burning power plants and reports the potential economic losses incurred by individual companies.

An asset is stranded when changes in technology or policy sharply reduce its value. Here we estimate differences in operating income of 16,438 fossil-fired power generators assuming either no carbon price or carbon prices consistent with lower warming targets (1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, 2.2 °C and 2.6 °C) and aggregate these losses on a company and country level. To isolate the financial impact of carbon pricing on generator revenues, we hold electricity generation constant at historical levels across climate policy scenarios and allow generators to pass on 90% of the added carbon costs to the rate-paying consumers. Our default model uses a geographically uniform discount rate, consistent with the parameters widely used by models that generate the carbon prices listed in the shared socioeconomic pathways database28,29,30 (Supplementary Tables 1–4). Further details of our approach are described in Methods. It should be noted that, although our model represents climate mitigation policy in terms of carbon prices, such prices may reflect a multitude of specific policies that are more regionally scaled and not fully captured by our model. Thus, our results are not intended as financial projections for individual companies but rather as a relative indicator of which companies have the highest financial risks under climate policies aligned with international targets if governments do not implement compensatory policies for asset owners.

Figure 1 illustrates the net present value of the added operating costs and foregone operating income from existing fossil-fuel-burning power plants worldwide under carbon pricing scenarios consistent with limiting global mean temperature increases to around 2 °C, assuming each plant continues to operate under its historical conditions into the future. Under these scenarios, the total added costs to fossil fuel power-plant operators are US$18.9 trillion (US$16–21.7 trillion), US$5.4 trillion (US$4.6–6.1 trillion), US$3.7 trillion (US$3.2–4.2 trillion) and US$1.7 trillion (US$1.5–1.9 trillion) based on the median carbon price for each climate policy trajectory, respectively (Fig. 1). Coal-burning power-plant operators would incur 75% of the total costs under a 1.5 °C climate mitigation scenario (Fig. 1a). More than half these costs are concentrated among power-generating companies in China and a substantial share of the costs are borne by companies in India (9.6%), the USA (7.3%) and Indonesia (2.0%) (Fig. 1b). Added costs are highly concentrated amongst countries and companies: 10 companies would be responsible for 24.0% of the total, 90 other companies would bear 33.7%, with the remainder of these costs being divided among 4,851 companies (Fig. 1c). In the absence of strict regulation, power companies are likely to pass through a large share of carbon-related operating cost increases to rate payers, thereby reducing their own financial exposure. However, the portion of costs not passed through by the utility operator would ultimately be absorbed by the company as a loss to operating income (stranded assets). Consequently, the magnitude of financial losses to companies will not only depend on the stringency of climate policy, but also on the proportion of costs passed through to electricity rate payers and the discount rates used to value foregone revenues. We find that stranded assets total US$1.9 trillion, US$0.5 trillion, US$0.4 trillion and US$0.16 trillion under scenarios in which power-generating companies are permitted to pass through 90% of their increased operating costs associated with carbon prices consistent with 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 2.2 °C and 2.6 °C climate targets, respectively, while discount rates are held constant across nations (Fig. 1d). However, revenue losses to fossil power generators are highly sensitive to the share of costs passed on to rate payers, ranging from approximately US$0.9 trillion to US$2.8 trillion under pass-through assumptions of 95% to 85%, respectively, in the 1.5 °C scenario alone. By comparison, stranded assets increase by 25% to 60% when adopting lower and more geographically differentiated cost of capital estimates (Supplementary Table 5), as lower discount rates in many major economies raise the present value of foregone revenue (Supplementary Fig. 1). Although the absolute value of stranded assets increases under more ambitious climate scenarios and under lower-pass through or discount rates, the proportional concentration among power-generator operators (for example, fuel, region and ownership) of these assets remains relatively unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that these financing assumptions strongly affect magnitude but not the relative distribution of risks. Not shown in the figures, a well-known metric of market concentration, the Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI), indicates that ownership of stranded coal plants is substantially more concentrated (0.0142) than natural gas plants (0.0048; Methods).

Of the 100 companies that own the most stranded assets by value, the very largest are state-owned (denoted by an asterisk below) and the top 25 companies cumulatively hold upwards of US$770 billion in stranded assets and are responsible for emitting 4.0 GtCO2 per year—nearly 11% of global CO2 emissions in 2024. Among coal plants, these companies include China’s five largest power producers: Huaneng Group*, Datang Corporation*, Huadian Group*, China State Power Investment Corporation* and China Energy Investment*, which cumulatively account for US$79 to US$134 billion of coal assets stranded by the 2.0 °C scenario (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Beyond China, NTPC Limited* (owned by India’s Ministry of Power), Korea Electric Power* (South Korea), Perusahaan Listrik Negara* (Indonesia) and Adani Enterprises LTD (India) also hold around US$22 to US$33 billion in stranded coal-burning assets (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Stranded coal assets in China and India are large primarily because these countries are operating relatively new power plants: in both countries, the capacity-averaged age of coal-burning power plants is <15 years (Fig. 2b). The largest owners of stranded gas- and oil-burning plants include Egyptian Electric Holdings* (Egypt), Saudi Electricity* (Saudi Arabia), Nextera Energy (USA), Ministry of Electricity Iraq* (Iraq), Korea Electric Power (South Korea), Calpine (USA), CLP Group (China) and Engie S.A. (France; Fig. 2c). These companies operate large and/or young fleets of power plants (Fig. 2d).

The degree to which ownership of stranded fossil-fuel-burning power-plant assets is concentrated is shown in Fig. 3, which shows the share of fuel-specific emissions related to generators stranded under a carbon price consistent with a 2.0 °C scenario. Roughly 30% of CO2 emissions from coal plants are attributable to power plants owned by 10 companies (Fig. 3a,c) and more than half of CO2 emissions are from 50 companies. Ownership of stranded gas-burning power plants is more evenly distributed, with 100 companies owning gas-fired generators that emit half the emissions from natural gas- and oil-burning power plants (Fig. 3b,d). Some key assumptions underlying our engineering-based estimates of stranded assets include the operational capacity factor of individual fossil-fuel-burning power plants, carbon price trajectories, cost of capital estimates and pass-through rates. We test our results using lower and more granular cost of capital estimates (Supplementary Table 5) and observe an increase in stranded assets, but the relative patterns of stranding across firms, fuels and regions remain largely consistent (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 6). Figure 4 illustrates how estimated stranded-asset values vary under different power-plant operating conditions and various carbon pricing scenarios. We find that higher carbon prices (more stringent climate policies), extending fossil-fuel-burning power-plant lifespans and increased capacity factors all raise the value of stranded assets, but the relative importance of these variables is somewhat different for fossil-fuel-burning power plants burning different fossil fuels (Fig. 4). Coal-burning plants are the most sensitive to carbon price as they generally release more CO2 per unit of electricity generated and natural gas power plants are more evenly sensitive to both carbon prices and capacity factor (Fig. 4a,b). Similar patterns are observed with respect to power-plant operational lifespans, where carbon prices have a more pronounced impact on the stranded-asset values of coal power generators compared with gas-fired plants (Fig. 4d,c). Despite modelling assumptions, we observe that the distribution of stranded-asset risks among regions and companies remains largely consistent and companies with the greatest risk of stranded assets are those that have invested in and deployed the most fossil-fuel-burning power-plant capacity most recently.

Uncertainties as to the timing and stringency of climate policies have encouraged continued investments in fossil-fuel-fired electricity generation, even as international climate goals (for example, limiting the increase of global mean temperature to around 2.0 °C) would entail the costly early retirement of a substantial portion of existing fossil infrastructure2,19,29,31. Here we develop an engineering-based estimate of stranded assets for the power sector and estimate the global total to be in the trillions of dollars over the next 40 years, more than half of which is owned by just 100 companies. Previous studies have estimated the economic impacts of stranded fossil fuel assets at national or global scales, reporting losses ranging from approximately US$500 billion to over US$4 trillion, depending on the stringency and timing of the implemented climate policy14,22,23,24,25,32. Our results are broadly consistent with these estimates, despite differences in methodological approach and the framing of stranded assets. Where previous studies assess stranded assets at the sector, country or financial system levels, our analysis identifies stranded assets at the company level and reveals that financial exposure is concentrated among a relatively few firms, particularly those with substantial investments in coal-fired power generation. While our estimates provide a benchmark for financial exposure under stringent climate policy, real-world asset stranding is likely to unfold in a more uneven environment, due to regional differences in policy, electricity market structures and financing conditions and thus may be more regionally differentiated than what is observed here. Still, our results may be useful for the growing number of investors and regulators interested in assessing policy-related transition risks18,33. In contrast to general statements about the potential costs of climate and energy policies, such as those made pursuant to the requirements of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures34, we have quantified the value of the assets of companies at risk of being stranded under different climate goals using publicly available information and transparent assumptions.

Under the most ambitious climate mitigation scenarios, we find stranded assets increase in companies whose power holdings have capacity-weighted average operational life of less than 20 years, most of which are owned and operated by China’s big five energy-generating companies—China Huaneng Group corporation*, China Datang Corporation*, China Huadian Corporation*, China Energy Investment* and China State Power Investment Corporation*. These state-owned enterprises are managed by the State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) and have been at the forefront of China’s energy and economic growth in recent decades. Cumulatively, SASAC manages 331 GW and 49 GW of coal- and gas-fired capacity, respectively (around 28.1% of China’s total electricity-generating capacity) and together, the power plants owned by these companies produce roughly 15% of the committed emissions of the global power sector. Consequently, China’s state-owned power infrastructure presents a unique opportunity and challenge for global decarbonization efforts as state-owned enterprises are largely incentivized by public service mandates rather than typical economic frameworks and are therefore more insulated from broader market forces35,36. Thus, the economic structure of state-owned enterprises can ultimately hinder or propel green technology investment relative to private firms, but is largely dependent on the regulatory directives of the state. Still, additional costs to state-owned power-generating enterprises constitute a public policy problem for national governments. Depending on the public objectives of those entities, costs may not be borne entirely by the enterprise itself but might be redistributed more generally across the population. While there is some evidence suggesting that state-owned enterprises may be more inclined than private firms to adopt environmentally friendly policies, the degree to which governments pursue policies counter to their economic objectives is relatively unknown and warrants further investigation35,37, particularly given that the scale of potential financial losses can also create strong incentives to resist more stringent climate policy. Given its notable role as a global producer of consumer goods38, the sudden financial collapse of the power infrastructure overseen by SASAC could have extensive financial implications beyond China’s borders and thus merits special consideration. By comparison, in Western economies, corporate power-generating entities and public utilities have largely lowered annual CO2 emissions by heavily investing in natural gas-fired power generation39. However, the substitution of aging coal-fired power generators with newer gas-fired power infrastructure has not substantially reduced cumulative emissions and has instead increased the transition risks for power-generating firms in the USA39 and European Union.

While our findings offer valuable insights into the risks faced by specific companies, they are subject to several important caveats and limitations. First, our estimates of stranded assets are a result of financial conditions and policy trajectories that vary across countries and are likely to evolve over time, including climate policy (carbon pricing consistent with a specific warming target), cost of capital and the proportion of costs absorbed by individual companies. To the extent that the stringency of global climate policy is insufficient to meet lower warming targets, then our estimates will be correspondingly smaller. Similarly, our valuation of stranded assets is based on the assumption that fossil fuel power generators will continue to operate to the end of their working lives. While this assumption provides a useful upper bound for estimating stranded assets, it may overestimate operational persistence. In practice, there is considerable variation in power-plant lifespans due to regulatory design, maintenance requirements and economic conditions, which can lead to the early retirement of younger, more efficient generators or the extended operation of older plants40,41. Thus, to the extent that financial markets or asset owners already anticipate some tightening of climate policy over the lifetimes of assets or, conversely, reflect scepticism about the realization or stringency of climate policy, elements of this risk may already be priced into assets or appear on company balance sheets and thus be reflected in their current market valuation. Furthermore, substantial changes in fuel prices, evolving economic pressures or technological advancements may prompt earlier-than-expected retirements of fossil-fired-generating assets even in the absence of carbon pricing or climate-driven mandates. Therefore, given the complex and evolving factors driving stranded assets, our results should not be interpreted as forecasts for corporate revenues, investment returns, market capitalization or current stock valuation. Nor should our estimates be interpreted as unrealized capital that would automatically accrue to firms if more ambitious climate policy efforts were ultimately abandoned, as current company valuations already embed expectations about future profitability amid evolving macroeconomic conditions. Nonetheless, our results consistently show that the same companies hold the largest share of stranded assets across various climate mitigation policy trajectories and financing assumptions, indicating that these entities are most at risk of asset stranding.

It should also be noted that we assume companies will internalize some of the costs associated with carbon pricing, rather than transferring all additional expenses to their rate payers. In some cases, only a smaller portion of the carbon costs will be passed on to consumers, while in less competitive markets, all these costs can be passed through to rate payers42. The degree to which companies can pass costs on to consumers will depend on the development of carbon-free power generation, consumer demand response to increasing energy prices and regulatory processes that determine local electricity rates43,44. Our analysis attributes the added costs from carbon pricing as stranded-asset exposure to corporate owners, although we recognize that this does not fully capture the distribution of financial risk or liability. Utilities frequently use risk-sharing strategies, such as project-level non-recourse debt, leasing structures or regulatory cost of service frameworks, which shift financial exposure to lenders, lessors or consumers. However, these arrangements are often private and inconsistently disclosed, making them difficult to incorporate into asset-level modelling. Additionally, the timing at which carbon pricing is implemented also influences our results, as the financial risk of a company diminishes as its fossil-fired power fleet ages and increases as new carbon-emitting power plants come online. Consequently, the scale of stranded assets held by each corporate entity is likely to fluctuate over time. Although many countries, such as China and India, have nascent carbon pricing mechanisms, others, including the USA, lack such programmes at the national level.

Additionally, carbon policies that are more substantially geographically differentiated than the regional estimates used here, for instance, to reflect the differentiated responsibility of individual countries as opposed to economic regions, would produce different geographic distributions of stranded assets. Nonetheless, the carbon price schedules we adopt reflect cost-minimizing pathways for achieving more ambitious climate mitigation targets and the central pass-through rates used in this study are representative of those observed in more-established carbon markets within the electricity sector. If, instead, countries implement non-price instruments to achieve their emissions goals, the associated costs and potential for stranded assets will be correspondingly higher. Finally, our analysis is grounded in projections of power-plant revenues and costs based on historical electricity-generation returns. However, projected revenues and input costs are subject to change, with precise operational conditions, maintenance and fuel costs influenced by dynamic future conditions that are unknown and very difficult, if not impossible, to model. Yet changing costs and revenues will probably alter the operating schedules of future power generators.

We derived the corporate and state owners of 98% of individual operating fossil-electricity-generating plants from the global coal-plant tracker, global oil- and gas-plant tracker and global energy ownership tracker datasets obtained from the global energy monitor database. We omitted power plants from our calculations in the limited cases where the percentage of ownership was not listed within the data. We obtained technology-specific estimates of power-plant operating costs from the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group III (IPCC WGIII) and future carbon prices consistent with lower warming scenarios (1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, 2.2 °C and 2.6 °C scenarios) are obtained from the shared socioeconomic pathways database28,29,30. All monetary values are expressed in constant US$(2005), which is consistent with the carbon pricing estimates listed in the shared socioeconomic pathways database. While this approach ensures comparability across countries and time, it does not capture the potential impact of exchange rate fluctuations on historical or projected costs.

To quantify future profits, we project the expected generating income and costs of each power plant (i) individually over the anticipated operational life of the plant and assign profits to their respective parent company.

$$\mathrm{Generator}\,{\mathrm{profits}}_{{it}}={G}_{{it}}{\mathrm{EP}}_{{it}}-{G}_{{it}}{\mathrm{FC}}_{f}{\vartheta }_{i}-{{\rm{O}}\& {\rm{M}}}_{{it}}-{\mathrm{IC}}_{{it}}$$

In our study, generator profits are defined as the operating income earned from electricity generation over a period (t), calculated as power-plant revenue minus the cost of production. Income from production is determined by multiplying the annual electricity generation of each plant (G) with the regional price of electricity (EP) and subtracting the generating costs. Generating costs are calculated by multiplying annual electricity generation (G), global average fuel costs (FC) and a fuel-to-electricity conversion term (ϑ), in addition to the global operations and maintenance costs (O&M), as well as the investment costs (IC). Global average, technology-specific power-plant operational costs are obtained from the IPCC WGIII report49, while regionally distinct electricity prices are obtained from GCAM v.7 and although more granular data could improve accuracy in specific contexts, our approach allows for consistency and comparability across countries. In line with the IPCC approach, we include capital investment costs in our estimates. Although typically considered sunk and not expected to influence operational decisions, these costs reflect ongoing financial obligations that may persist for debt-financed infrastructure. We adopt a geographically uniform discount rate of 10%, consistent with the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates for a high-risk market50,51,52, to reflect investor expectations under a riskier operating environment associated with climate policy and given the absence of a globally comprehensive cost of capital dataset. However, to test the sensitivity of our results against more heterogeneous financing conditions, we use lower regional- and country-level discount rates to reflect lower perceived investment risks and financing costs. Country-level cost of capital values are taken from ref. 53, which reports estimates for about 100 countries. These values are aggregated according to the regional classifications used in the carbon pricing data, with regional averages assigned to countries that have missing values. Additionally, as individual power plants age, the operational and maintenance costs typically increase such that these costs are not well covered by the generated revenues, resulting in their closure historically around 30 years for natural gas and 40 years12,54,55,56,57 for coal-fired power-generating infrastructure. Therefore, we allow for existing power infrastructure to retire in line with their historical norms, except for cases where a projected retirement date is explicitly listed in the power-plant data.

To quantify the impacts of climate mitigation policy on fossil-fired power-plant profits, we first calculate the net present value of these generating assets (i) on the basis of the operating income for each generator. We allow firms to retire these plants following historical conditions and do not explore the ramifications of the financial liabilities this may cause. Additionally, to avoid abrupt retirements of power-generating assets, we gradually raise the annual carbon price on an annual basis in line with the carbon pricing used by IPCC climate projection models, which use the shared socioeconomic framework30 (Supplementary Tables 1–4).

$${{\rm{NPV}}}_{i}=\displaystyle \mathop{\sum }\limits_{t=0}^{{\rm{LT}}}\frac{{\rm{Generator}}\,{\rm{profits}}}{{(1+r)}^{t}}$$

We translate future climate trajectories (1.5 °C through 2.6 °C) into stranded assets by incorporating regionally specific carbon price paths used by integrated assessment models for climate mitigation scenarios58. Carbon prices translate directly into increased input costs for fossil fuel plants, diminishing future profit projections. Therefore, we modify power-generator profits by including the additional accrued costs of electricity generation.

$$\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{Modified}\,\mathrm{generator}\,\mathrm{profits}}_{it}\\ ={G}_{it}{\mathrm{EP}}_{it}-{G}_{it}{\mathrm{FC}}_{f}{\vartheta }_{i}-{G}_{it}{\mathrm{ECP}}_{t}(1-\mathrm{PTR})-{{\rm{O}}\& {\rm{M}}}_{it}-{\mathrm{IC}}_{it}\end{array}$$

Where E is the total annual emissions for each plant, PTR is the uniform pass-through rates and CP is the regionally based carbon pricing at the time (t), which achieves the climate emission scenario. Since most countries lack established carbon markets, there is limited empirical evidence available to determine national-level carbon price pass-through rates. Under conditions of perfect competition and full market efficiency, carbon costs would almost certainly be fully passed through to electricity prices, resulting in a 100% pass-through rate and no direct cost burden to fossil fuel generators59. In practice, however, observed pass-through rates vary across markets because of various factors such as market structure, regulatory interventions, the availability of alternative generation capacity and uncertainty in emission cost projections60,61. As a result, we adopt a range of 85% to 95% pass-through rates based on values reported in the existing literature42,62,63. Annual emissions are calculated for each individual unit from equations that vary slightly based on their fuel type. We obtain the emission equations from the Global Energy Monitor and IEA estimates.

$${{\rm{Annual}}\,{{\rm{CO}}}_{2}\,{\rm{emissions}}}_{{\rm{Coal}}}={G}_{{it}}\times {{\rm{HR}}}_{i}\times {{\rm{EF}}}_{i}\times C$$

$${{\rm{Annual}}\,{{\rm{CO}}}_{2}}\,{\rm{emissions}}_{{\rm{Gas}}}={G}_{{it}}\times {{\rm{LCEF}}}_{i}$$

Where HR is the technology-specific heat rate, EF denotes the emission factor of coal plants and LCEF represents the life-cycle emissions factor associated with natural-gas power plants. In our study, we define stranded assets as the difference in future asset income with and without the implementation of a climate policy that limits warming:

$${{\rm{Stranded}}\,{\rm{assets}}}_{i}=\displaystyle \mathop{\sum }\limits_{t=0}^{{\rm{LT}}}\frac{{{\rm{GP}}}_{i}-\widehat{{{\rm{GP}}}_{i}}}{{(1+r)}^{t}}=\displaystyle \mathop{\sum }\limits_{t=0}^{{\rm{LT}}}\frac{{G}_{{it}}{{\rm{ECP}}}_{t}(1-{\rm{PTR}})}{{(1+r)}^{t}}$$

We aggregate unit-level monetary income over the operational lifetime of the power generator and assign these losses to their parent company (corporate or state-enterprise owners) and select the top 100 companies by stranded-asset holdings. To investigate the national economic risk from stranded fossil-fired capacity, we quantify and assign the monetary value of these losses within the borders of each nation. We quantify the concentration of company-level stranded assets using the HHI, calculated as the sum of the squared shares of stranded assets relative to the total stranded assets for each fuel type. The HHI reflects the degree of concentration, with higher values indicating that a greater proportion of stranded assets is concentrated among fewer companies. Our analysis of stranded assets relies on publicly available data used by integrated assessment models for carbon prices28,29,30, which are commonly used in climate change forecasts and by the broader scientific community and historical average power-plant operating conditions for each individual unit. Nonetheless, we recognize that the value of stranded assets is determined by the carbon pricing amount and is also influenced by the use of power generators. Thus, we test the sensitivity of our results by varying the carbon price trajectory incrementally per year until the maximum price of US$0 to US$1,000 per ton is reached and fluctuating the capacity factor from 20% to 90%. We report the implications of these variations on global fossil-fired power-generator stranded assets in our sensitivity analyses. In a separate sensitivity test, we use historical capacity-factor estimates and instead vary the power-generator operating life and report these results. We subsequently repeat our sensitivity test, but instead of gradually increasing carbon prices over time, we apply the maximum carbon prices immediately and uniformly for the entire duration of the lifespans of the power infrastructures and show its effects on stranded-asset values. Overall, our approach enables us to assess the potential economic impacts of stranded fossil-fired power-generation assets, providing valuable insights into the financial risks faced by corporate entities and the challenges associated with transitioning to a low-carbon energy system.

'No question' - Cape Cod Times,Heather McCarron,,,,,https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/environment/2025/12/11/u-s-district-court-cape-cod-massachusetts-judge-patti-saris-offshore-wind-maura-healey/87687775007/,"A federal judge ruled against the Trump Administration's pause on wind energy projects, calling the enforcement of the pause ""arbitrary and capricious.""
Offshore wind is the answer,” he said.
“We need offshore wind to meet demand, create jobs and lower costs,"" Healey said in Dec. 9 email.
President Trump’s decision to halt offshore wind projects ""reflected a commitment to responsible ocean management,"" he said.
“After nine months on pause, there’s no question that offshore wind projects have taken a hit in time and money,” she said.","A federal judge ruled against the Trump Administration's pause on wind energy projects, calling the enforcement of the pause ""arbitrary and capricious.""

The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by 17 states, including Massachusetts, which argued the pause delayed economic benefits and clean energy delivery.

Some fishing industry representatives expressed disappointment, though, stating the original pause was a commitment to responsible ocean management.

A federal judge has pushed back on the Trump Administration's pause on wind energy projects carried out by federal agencies, raising new questions for offshore plans near Cape Cod — a ruling that some welcome, but disappointed others.

The finding, released from the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts on Dec. 8, does not cancel President Trump’s original executive memorandum calling for a pause on wind approvals, but it does call for ending federal agencies’ enforcement of his directives.

The Sierra Club Massachusetts is among those applauding the court’s finding. In May, the organization joined nine other environmental groups in a filing arguing that the administration’s “wind directive” was arbitrary and not based in science, lacked a clear purpose and timeline, and jeopardized climate goals and public health.

In a Dec, 9 statement, Sierra Club Massachusetts Chapter Director Vick Mohanka called the ruling “a pivotal win in our movement to ensure Massachusetts has access to affordable, clean energy harnessed right off our coast by local union workers.”

“Our communities need rate relief and an escape route off the rollercoaster of gas price spikes reflected on our monthly utility bills. Offshore wind is the answer,” he said. “As Sierra Club, we will continue doing our part in championing our state’s projects across the finish line so they may soon deliver reliable energy that keeps the lights on and bills low.”

A status hearing is scheduled for Dec. 15 to clarify some lingering questions about the decision, according to the Conservation Law Foundation. Since the administration can appeal, the effects of the finding will not be immediate and could ultimately change.

Gov. Maura Healey also welcomed the judge's ruling.

“We need offshore wind to meet demand, create jobs and lower costs,"" Healey said in Dec. 9 email. “I’m grateful to AG Campbell and her team for their work to defend this crucial energy source, protecting jobs and economic activity across the country and here in Massachusetts.""

'Deeply disappointing'

Others who have raised concerns about accelerated permitting, inadequate review and potential harm of wind development are disappointed.

Among them is New England Fishermen's Stewardship Association President Aaron Williams.

“As a fisherman who has witnessed the effects of offshore wind on our ocean and the risks it poses to coastal communities and fishermen, (the) ruling is deeply disappointing,"" he said in a Dec. 9 statement.

President Trump’s decision to halt offshore wind projects ""reflected a commitment to responsible ocean management,"" he said. ""Overturning that decision is a step backward in defending our oceans and the working waterfront.""

""AT NEFSA, we remain dedicated to preventing the industrialization of our fishing grounds and urge that this ruling be reconsidered. Our ocean and the people who depend on it deserve protection, not policies that prioritize corporate interest over sustainability,"" Williams said.

An executive memorandum from Jan. 20

The finding stems from the executive memorandum Trump issued on Jan. 20 ordering federal agencies to pause all new permitting, leasing and approvals for wind energy projects while reviewing the government’s decision making on such projects. Federal agencies, including the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, acted on that memo by halting the approval process for projects both onshore and offshore, and calling back already approved permits for review.

Led by the state of New York and the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, 17 states — including Massachusetts — filed a lawsuit in May, arguing that the pause has delayed economic benefits, reduced tax revenue, and slowed delivery of essential renewable energy.

The lawsuit highlighted specific projects, including SouthCoast Wind planned south of Martha’s Vineyard, that the order delayed. Prior to the executive memo, Massachusetts also had multiple offshore wind projects in the lineup, including Avangrid’s New England Wind 1 and 2 (formerly Park City Wind and Commonwealth Wind), whose permits the Trump administration has sought to revoke.

Craigville Beach and Dowses Beach in Barnstable are both proposed for cable landing sites for the New England Wind projects, and Falmouth has been eyed as a landing destination for SouthCoast's second phase.

Ruling: 'Arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law'

In her ruling U. S. District Court Judge Patti Saris said the agencies’ actions were “arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law,” and called for the pause to be canceled entirely. The court found that the state and ACE NY were harmed because the pause delayed projects, increased costs, and prevented communities from getting more clean energy as scheduled.

According to the ruling, the states “have each satisfied” the requirement to show they were directly affected and that undoing the pause would fix those problems. The court’s authority to step in comes from both federal law and the Constitution, the ruling stated.

When the court finds a government action unlawful, it can cancel it completely, the ruling stated. Also, if it stands, the ruling would restore the ability for wind energy projects to move forward and find that the administration’s action violated the law.

'Important turning point'

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at Conservation Law Foundation, on Dec. 9 said the ruling “is an important turning point” for wind energy developers and those who support it.

“After nine months on pause, there’s no question that offshore wind projects have taken a hit in time and money,” she said.

While recognizing that the ruling “doesn’t compel the federal government to restart permitting tomorrow, it does vindicate the sector and give developers the confidence to keep planning for a resurgence,” she said.

If that weren’t bad enough, U.S. automakers are also contending with wild swings in federal policy.
But today the largest maker of lithium-ion batteries for cars is CATL, a Chinese company founded in 2011.
They have to largely depend on private capital, especially after Congress cut or eliminated programs designed to foster electric vehicle manufacturing.
Some analysts say it’s already too late for U.S. automakers to beat China.","In 2021, after Apple gave up on its secretive plans to build a driverless electric car, Doug Field left the technology company to embark on a mission impossible meant to save the American auto industry.

He rejoined Ford Motor, where he had started his career decades earlier, with the grand ambition of designing electric vehicles that would allow the century-old company to compete with Chinese carmakers, whose vehicles are hugely popular with consumers and breaking global sales records.

Mr. Field knew the old ways of Detroit wouldn’t do. Time was short, and to jolt the storied automaker into action he created an automotive start-up of sorts — a secretive lab near Los Angeles, with a satellite office in the heart of Silicon Valley, that he called a “skunk works.”

He recruited engineers and designers from electric vehicle makers like Tesla, Rivian and Lucid and from start-ups working on batteries, electronics and software, and promised them the kind of creative freedom that tech workers take for granted.

The auto industry is undergoing change the likes of which it hasn’t seen since the early 1900s, when Henry Ford’s Model T and moving assembly line transformed the economy and how people got around. The ubiquitous horse-drawn buggy was consigned to museums, while countless other businesses became obsolete.

Ford and other established carmakers are now staring down that kind of obsolescence, particularly as Chinese companies like BYD and Geely race forward, producing 60 percent of all electric vehicles worldwide.

The best hope is to leapfrog the Chinese by producing better batteries, more efficient electric motors and other breakthroughs and then doing it again and again. And the best hope for making those things happen are people like Mr. Field, who are trying to teach Detroit to be as innovative as Silicon Valley.

“I knew it would be a completely different challenge than anything I’d done before,” he said, “which was to try and change the course of a large organization.”

Nobody knows how this contest will play out, but there are already signs that the Western automakers are falling even further behind. Many of their most innovative and affordable battery-powered models are still years away. Mr. Field’s first vehicle isn’t expected to even go on sale until 2027.

Mr. Field, who has also worked at Tesla and Segway, is fully aware that teams like his have the fate of an entire industry in their hands. More than four million Americans work at car and parts factories, dealerships and repair shops.

President Trump is determined to turn back the clock on electric cars, even dropping strict fuel efficiency standards that favored them. But as most of the world pivots decisively away from the combustion engine, car executives see no choice but to stay the course.

‘Room to Run’

One thing going for the underdog Western automakers is that there is plenty of room to improve how electric cars are made, and there is also no shortage of ambitious entrepreneurs wanting to make a go of it.

One Boston area start-up, AM Batteries, is among several companies working on machinery that can reduce the cost of battery manufacturing. The equipment made by the start-up forms layers of lithium, nickel and other materials into battery cells using a dry powder instead of the wet slurry used in most battery factories today.

The technology eliminates the need for a long drying process, does not generate toxic chemicals, and shortens the assembly line, saving time and money. And, if it can be put to use on a large scale, the company’s approach will make batteries — the most expensive part of an electric car — more affordable.

“What keeps me awake at night is knowing that engineers in China and Japan are doing the same thing,” said Lie Shi, AM’s chief executive.

AM, whose investors include the venture capital arms of Toyota and Porsche, is among dozens of young companies looking for ways to make electric vehicles cheaper and more practical.

Daqus Energy in Woburn, Mass., is trying to make batteries from plentiful organic materials rather than costly metals like lithium, nickel and cobalt. Estes Energy Solutions in San Francisco is developing a way to package battery cells that makes them lighter.

Niron Magnetics in Minnesota is working with Stellantis, the maker of Jeep and other brands, on substitutes for the rare earth metals required for electric motors, so that automakers are not dependent on supplies from China. There are many other examples.

“There is a lot of room to run with these technologies,” said Brian Potter, a structural engineer who recently wrote the book “The Origins of Efficiency.”

As innovative as start-ups are, ultimately the onus will be on Ford and other established carmakers, which are used to incremental change, to overhaul the way they work. Mr. Field’s California team has developed a medium-size pickup assembled in a way that illustrates the kind of innovation that may be the U.S. auto industry’s best hope.

The front and rear sections of the pickup will be cast from molten aluminum in giant machines rather than being welded and glued together from hundreds of pieces, the way most cars are made today.

The method allows Ford to install instrument panels and other interior parts before the large sections are fitted together around a battery. Assembly line workers don’t need to lean awkwardly into car interiors as is the case in most car factories today.

Assembly will be so much more efficient and inexpensive that when the pickup goes on sale it will cost $30,000, Ford said, not much more than the smaller gasoline-powered Ford Maverick.

The stakes are enormous — and not just for Ford.

“Any car company that doesn’t adapt,” said Joachim Post, a senior executive at BMW, “will have trouble surviving.”

Move Fast or Get Run Over

While Chinese cars are effectively barred from the United States by high tariffs and other restrictions, Ford dealers in places like Bangkok, London and Mexico City are already battling Chinese carmakers that offer high-quality vehicles at low prices, Jim Farley, Ford’s chief executive, said in a recent interview in Detroit. If Ford and other U.S. automakers can’t defend their turf, they risk becoming niche manufacturers of big gas guzzlers confined to the United States.

“I have 10,000 dealers around the world. Only 2,800 are in the U.S.,” Mr. Farley said. “So you do the math.”

In Thailand, for example, the Ford Everest gasoline sport-utility vehicle seats seven and starts at 1.2 million baht, or $37,700. An electric BYD M6 can seat six and costs $26,000.

“It’s the biggest battle of my career,” Mr. Farley said.

Mr. Farley’s uneasiness is reflected across the auto industry. Electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, account for about 10 percent of new car sales in the United States, but in Europe they account for almost 30 percent and in China more than 50 percent.

If that weren’t bad enough, U.S. automakers are also contending with wild swings in federal policy. Mr. Trump, who dismisses climate science, has reversed auto and energy policies dating from as far back as the administration of George W. Bush.

Innovative technologies could be the salvation of the U.S. auto industry, but only if they are manufactured here. Historically, that has not always been the case. The lithium-ion battery was developed largely in U.S., British and Japanese university and corporate labs. But today the largest maker of lithium-ion batteries for cars is CATL, a Chinese company founded in 2011.

Start-ups in the United States have a built-in disadvantage. The Chinese government provides long-lasting financial and other support to automakers and battery companies as part of a national drive to become a global player.

“The government is completely in bed with the local brands,” Mr. Farley of Ford said.

Innovative firms in the United States do get help from the government but it can be fleeting because priorities often change in Washington. They have to largely depend on private capital, especially after Congress cut or eliminated programs designed to foster electric vehicle manufacturing.

Western companies need to move quickly. They can take as long as seven years to develop a completely new vehicle and set up an assembly line to build it. Chinese manufacturers can get a new model to showrooms in half that time and sometimes even less.

To speed up development of its newest electric vehicle, a sport-utility vehicle called the iX3, top BMW executives visited engineers and designers at their offices every four weeks rather than requiring those employees to troop to headquarters in Munich for approvals.

Teams were encouraged to ignore traditional barriers between corporate divisions. Experts in foam technology who had designed car seats were recruited to find the best kind of foam to insulate batteries so the new model would be fire and crash resistant.

BMW engineers are particularly proud of a panoramic digital display that stretches across the bottom of the car’s windshield, providing driving directions and other information without requiring drivers to take their eyes off the road.

The company plans to begin selling the iX3 in the United States in 2026 for around $60,000. The car will travel 400 miles on a full charge and can be topped off at a fast charger in just 21 minutes.

But in a demonstration of how hard it is to stay a step ahead of China, Xiaomi, a maker of smartphones and cars in Beijing, has begun selling a car with a panoramic display similar to BMW’s. And some new BYD cars can be refueled in less than 10 minutes at ultrafast chargers the company has begun building in China.

The designers and engineers know that “you both have this job to make something efficient that’s incredibly attractive,” said Mr. Field, who credits his parents for giving him an appreciation for engineering and aesthetics. His father was a chemical engineer and his mother was an artist and musician.

Mr. Field, who lived in Texas, Indiana, Canada and Connecticut while growing up, stuck close to his father’s career path and studied mechanical engineering at Purdue. He later earned master’s degrees in engineering and business at M.I.T.

While Ford took an unusual step in isolating this team far from its home base, other automakers like Mercedes-Benz, G.M. and Honda have also instructed employees to come up with what the industry calls a “clean sheet design” — one that is not encumbered by previous models or ways of doing things.

There are other problems for U.S. automakers in particular. Big vehicles with internal combustion engines like Ford’s F-150 pickup are very profitable because they don’t cost a lot more to manufacture than smaller cars. But people are willing to pay more for a big truck or S.U.V. because they feel like they are getting more for their money.

The same logic does not apply to electric vehicles, where batteries account for a large share of the cost. Making an electric vehicle becomes more expensive with size because of the need for bigger, costlier batteries.

Some analysts say it’s already too late for U.S. automakers to beat China. Instead, they should take the “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” approach and form partnerships with Chinese manufacturers to get access to their technology, said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm that invests in transportation.

“If I were leading any of the carmakers right now I would focus on partnering with the Chinese,” Ms. Natarajan said.

Dan Cook, the chief executive of Lyten, a San Jose, Calif., battery maker, said he had faith in the creativity and willingness to take risks that has so often put the United States at the forefront of new technologies like computers and microchips.

Lyten is developing batteries made primarily of lithium and sulfur, which is extremely cheap and readily available in the United States. If the company can mass produce it, the result would be cheaper and lighter batteries not dependent on materials from China.

“Silicon Valley is here because of the freedom to innovate,” said Mr. Cook, who started his career at G.M., “and the freedom to think and make mistakes.”

Mr. Field’s task now, he said, is to meld Ford’s century of manufacturing experience with this kind of inventiveness. As the vehicle moves closer to production, he has been allowing more people to cross the skunk works’ moat. The team now has a satellite office in Dearborn, Mich., Ford’s hometown.

“Getting a large company to be able to still produce high volume and high quality, and be able to innovate,” he said, “that would be a force to be reckoned with.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/12/multimedia/00auto-innovation-02-vbmz/00auto-innovation-02-vbmz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 05:58:45.816702

The winning bids generated $279.4 million at an average of $1.5 million each, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which oversaw the sale for the rights to explore and exploit oil and gas reserves under the Gulf’s sea floor. That compares with an $842,817 average in March 2023, the last time rights were leased in the Gulf.

Thirty companies submitted 219 bids for tracts off the coasts from Texas to Alabama.

But the lion’s share of bids were clustered 120 to 140 miles south of Morgan City and Houma in waters that are about 265 feet deep.

Chevron USA Inc. and BP Exploration made the most bids overall, mostly in this area. Both companies already have existing leases in the region.

“It’s a great day for American energy independence,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, said Wednesday. “We saw a strong interest in today’s lease sale, and I’m proud that millions of dollars from this sale will go directly to Louisiana’s coastal restoration and hurricane protection efforts.”

Louisiana received about $156 million in 2024 from the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. The state should receive more revenues this year under GoMESA, in which the federal government shares a portion of its revenues from energy production with states bordering the federal waters. Scalise recently got the cap increased for the participating states.

“The new law finally increases the amount of revenue sharing dollars Louisiana is eligible to receive from offshore lease sales, like the one held today, that will result in millions in new funding for our state’s vital coastal restoration efforts,” Kristi Trail, executive director of the Pontchartrain Conservancy, based in New Orleans, said in a statement.

“That only 1.3% of the acreage was leased suggests companies are being selective, likely prioritizing the most attractive deep water blocks and existing infrastructure tie-backs - rather than speculating widely,” Michael Hecht, head of Greater New Orleans Inc., an economic development organization, said in a text.

“While it would be too early to forecast employment numbers and economic impact, since leases are the first step in exploration and development, what is clear is that this will put some of the world’s most experienced energy professionals back to work in a meaningful way. Louisiana is a major onshore base for Gulf operations, so more leasing translates into more demand for offshore services, fabrication, vessels, logistics, heliports, engineers, and skilled trades,"" he added.

The governor’s office reports that 15% of the state’s total employment — 306,750 jobs — is supported by the energy sector. That work generates about $25.5 billion in annual statewide earnings.

“These lease sales put Louisiana to work and puts our state at the forefront of furthering America’s energy dominance,” said Tommy Faucheux, President of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association. “We are creating jobs, strengthening energy security, and delivering vital funding to restore Louisiana’s coastline.”

Wednesday’s Big Beautiful Gulf 1 lease sale was the first of 30 scheduled to take place over the next decade.

Erik Milito, president of National Ocean Industries Association, a Washington-based trade group for oilfield services industry, said energy producers need a regular cadence of lease sales to plan properly.

It’s currently being used at Musk’s xAI’s Colossus data center in Memphis, Tennessee.
Reeves said pairing batteries with data centers is an area that’s still under development but growing in popularity.
Enjeti said there’s already some commercial supercapacitors available to smooth the load data centers are consuming to train language-learning models.
Doing so could likely get the data center faster interconnection, Bonahoom said.","With data center developers in Texas and most other states now commonly deploying fossil fuel generators as backup power sources, a nascent industry from the renewable side of power generation—battery storage—has started elbowing its way into the fast-growing sector.

A new report by Oxford-based Aurora Energy Research detailed how adding battery storage to a site could improve data centers’ power quality, provide flexibility and reduce transmission congestion, while offering an opportunity to reduce emissions.

Battery storage already works as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), or a bridge from grid power to backup power, as most generators take anywhere from five to 30 minutes to ramp up, said Lizzie Bonahoom, an Aurora Energy Research associate.

There’s a long history of batteries being efficient and cost effective in UPS applications, said Jeff Reeves, a vice president of Battery Council International, a leading industry trade group in North America.

But there’s been a seismic shift in how data centers and digital infrastructure operate, Reeves said. It’s made battery companies reexamine how they do things to ensure they’re brought into the future, Reeves said.

“Everybody’s really racing to figure it out,” Reeves said. “AI is having a moment and everyone wants to make sure that they’re there for it.”

Some data center facilities being built in Texas have planned to co-locate their sites with battery storage. Of Google’s three new data centers across the state, totaling a $40 billion investment, one in Haskell County will be paired with a new solar and battery storage plant.

Elon Musk’s company Tesla rolled out its own battery marketed for industrial facilities like data centers called the Megapack. It’s currently being used at Musk’s xAI’s Colossus data center in Memphis, Tennessee.

The Megapack is said to be used to help smooth workloads to meet utility and generator requirements, improve the data center’s ability to stay online during voltage disturbances, offer flexible interconnection and emissions-free back up power.

Making the work more steady helps stop the quick spikes in electricity use that happen when training artificial intelligence. These spikes look like large swings on a power chart and present challenges for both the data center and the grid to handle. The oscillations often go beyond what’s recommended for the backup generators and can damage the equipment while also causing problems with the power grid’s stability.

Whether data centers can “ride through” voltage or frequency disturbances on Texas’ electric grid is already a concern for Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) officials. Most data centers are designed to disconnect from the grid during a disturbance to avoid data corruption or loss and switch to backup power.

Batteries can react right away when power use suddenly changes, the Aurora report said, functioning as a fast-acting ancillary service that keeps electricity steady and prevents big swings in demand.

Reeves said pairing batteries with data centers is an area that’s still under development but growing in popularity.

“They’re kind of like shock absorbers and load stabilization,” Reeves said about batteries in power-smoothing uses.

Prasad Enjeti, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Texas A&M University, said there are other technological options for load smoothing that are available now at scale. One being supercapacitors—a relative of batteries in their ability for a super-quick surge of power but with worse energy storage. Enjeti said there’s already some commercial supercapacitors available to smooth the load data centers are consuming to train language-learning models. It also could be solved on the software side, Enjeti said.

“There are many solutions,” Enjeti said. “I think they have to get their act together to come up with the right approach to minimize the cost.”

Tesla reports that its Megapack can make power use much more steady, cutting big ups and downs by more than 70 percent, so new data centers can use power systems already in place and get connected faster.

The battery can act in lieu of a transmission upgrade, Bonahoom said, preventing congestion— power lines being overloaded from demand. Doing so could likely get the data center faster interconnection, Bonahoom said.

“Time is of the essence,” Bonahoom said. “The value of getting a quicker interconnection is so high” because of the race to develop the most capable AI system.

Dallas-based Aligned Data Centers announced in October that a data center it is developing in Oregon will come online years earlier than would have been possible with traditional utility updates by securing a 31-megawatt battery from Calibrant, a company that provides on-site energy systems.

The on-site battery addresses siting and capacity bottlenecks and can give power back when the grid needs help, according to Aligned. It’s also designed to discharge during peak grid demand and ensure the “five-nines” of reliability—reliable power 99.999 percent of the time—data centers are seeking, the company stated.

Battery storage has quickly altered the Texas grid in recent years. Texas added nearly 1,500 megawatts of battery storage to the grid’s summer rated, peak demand capacities in 2023. That figure almost tripled to 4,374 megawatts added in 2024.

But given the scale of data center projects, the cost of batteries for how few hours they can run when compared to diesel generators, could make them prohibitively expensive, Bonahoom said.

Diesel generators for 2028 deployment cost companies on average about $1,159 per kilowatt and can run one or two weeks. By contrast, lithium-iron phosphate batteries cost nearly double, at $2,371 per kilowatt, and max out around 20 hours of run time, according to Aurora.

While there are investments in new technologies and battery chemistries to improve long duration storage, such as flow batteries—rechargeable batteries where energy is stored in liquid in external tanks, instead of inside solid battery cells—it’s still early, Reeves said. Some prospective clients are considering the batteries as a way to move away from relying solely on fossil fuels, or search for bridge solutions that can run for a few hours.

“Unless there are stringent congestion or flexibility requirements from the grid system operators and a clear outlook of what compensation would look like for batteries, the adoption of storage at data centers will depend on how well they can pitch themselves,” Bonahoom said. “That’s TBD.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2155016300-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:02:17.219090

Then Trump Shifted Guidance.,"Chris Bowling, shoshana.gordon@propublica.org",,,,,https://www.propublica.org/article/omaha-nebraska-lead-superfund-epa-trump,"If regional EPA officials applied the administration’s guidance to the Omaha site, over 13,000 more properties in Omaha could have qualified, a Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica analysis of EPA and city of Omaha soil tests found.
But in October, it changed the lead guidance.
Under the guidance, the EPA could issue a lower standard for the Omaha site.
When it came to the yard, her property tested for lead levels above the Biden guidance but didn’t qualify under the original cleanup threshold.
She had imagined growing fruit trees in her backyard until she discovered lead levels high enough to potentially clean up under the Biden guidelines.","The county health worker scanned the Omaha, Nebraska, home with an X-ray gun, searching for the poison.

It was 2022, and doctors had recently found high levels of lead in the blood of Crystalyn Prine’s 2-year-old son, prompting the Health Department to investigate. The worker said it didn’t seem to come from the walls, where any lead would be buried under layers of smooth paint. The lead assessor swabbed the floors for dust but didn’t find answers as to how Prine’s son had been exposed.

A danger did lurk outside, the worker told her. For more than a century, a smelter and other factories had spewed lead-laced smoke across the city’s east side, leading the federal government to declare a huge swath of Omaha a Superfund site and to dig up and replace nearly 14,000 yards — including about a third of the east side’s residential properties — since 1999.

Prine looked up the soil tests for her home online and discovered her yard contained potentially harmful levels of lead. But when she called the city, officials told her that her home didn’t qualify for government-funded cleanup under the standard in place from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Prine didn’t want to move out of the home that had been in her husband’s family for generations. So she followed the county’s advice to keep her five kids safe. They washed their hands frequently and took off their shoes when they came inside.

Then, Prine heard some news at the clinic where she worked as a nurse that gave her hope: In January 2024, the EPA under President Joe Biden lowered the lead levels that could trigger cleanup. Her home was above the new threshold.

That didn’t automatically mean her yard would be cleaned up, local officials told her, but last year, the EPA began to study the possibility of cleaning up tens of thousands of more yards in Omaha, according to emails and other records obtained by Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica. The agency was also discussing with local officials whether to expand the cleanup area to other parts of Omaha and its surrounding suburbs.

Then, this October, the Trump administration rolled back the Biden administration’s guidance. In doing so, it tripled the amount of lead that had to be in the soil to warrant a potential cleanup, meaning that Prine and other families might again be out of luck.

Prine’s son Jack, now 5, struggles to speak. He talks less than his 2-year-old brother and stumbles over five-word sentences.

“You would think that if lead is this impactful on a small child, that you would definitely want to be fixing it,” she said. “What do you do as a parent? I don’t want to keep my kid from playing outside. He loves playing outside, and I should be able to do that in my own yard.”

Scientists have long agreed about the dangers of lead. The toxic metal can get into kids’ brains and nervous systems, causing IQ loss and developmental delays. Experts say the Trump administration’s guidance runs counter to decades of research: In the 26 years since the government began to clean up east Omaha — the largest residential lead Superfund site in the country — scientists have found harm at ever lower levels of exposure.

Yet what gets cleaned up is often not just a matter of science but also money and government priorities, according to experts who have studied the Superfund program.

Prine’s block illustrates how widespread Omaha’s lead problem is and how many people who might have benefited from the Biden guidance may no longer get relief. Of the 11 homes on her block, four were cleaned up by the EPA. Six others tested below the original cleanup standard but above the levels in the Biden guidance and were never remediated.

Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica are embarking on a yearlong project about Omaha’s lead legacy, including testing soil to find out how effective the cleanup has been. If you live in or near the affected area, you can sign up for free lead testing of your soil.

Despite the changing guidance, Omaha still follows a cleanup standard set in 2009: Properties qualify for cleanup if parts of the yard have more than 400 parts per million of lead in the soil — the equivalent of a marble in a 10-pound bucket of dirt. The Biden administration lowered the guidance for so-called removal management levels to 200 parts per million.

The Trump administration has said its new guidance, which raised them to 600 parts per million, would speed cleanups by providing clearer direction and streamlining investigations of contaminated sites. But environmental advocates said it only accelerates project completion by cleaning up fewer properties.

The EPA disputed that. “Protecting communities from lead exposure at contaminated sites is EPA’s statutory responsibility and a top priority for the Trump EPA,” the agency said in a statement. “The criticism that our Residential Soil Lead Directive will result in EPA doing less is false.”

The new guidance doesn’t necessarily scrap the hopes of Omaha homeowners or the conversations that were happening around the Biden recommendations. That’s because the Trump administration continues to allow EPA managers to study properties with lower levels of lead, depending on how widespread the contamination is and how likely people are to be harmed. What actually gets cleaned up is decided by local EPA officials, who can set remediation levels higher or lower based on the circumstances of specific sites.

Regional EPA spokesperson Kellen Ashford said the agency is continuing to assess the Omaha site and will meet with local and state leaders to “chart a path forward with how the updated residential lead directive may apply.”

Gabriel Filippelli, executive director of Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute, has studied lead and Superfund sites for decades and said he is doubtful the EPA will spend the money to clean up more yards in Omaha. The EPA doesn’t act if “you don’t have local people raising alarm bells,” he said.

Yet in Omaha, many are unaware of the debate — or even the presence of lead in their yards. Most of the cleanup happened more than a decade ago. As years passed, new people moved in, and younger residents never learned about the site. Others who did know assumed the lead problem was solved. The dustup around lead has mostly settled even if much of the toxic metal in the city’s dirt never left.

“Mass Poison”

When Prine moved into Omaha’s Field Club neighborhood in 2018, she loved the Queen Anne and Victorian-style homes that lined shady boulevards and how her neighbors decorated heavily for Halloween and Christmas.

While she had visited the home previously to see her husband’s family, Prine had no idea her neighborhood was in the middle of a massive environmental cleanup.

“The first time I heard about it was when my son had an elevated blood-lead level,” she said.

From 1870 to 1997, the American Smelting and Refining Company sat on the Missouri River in downtown Omaha, melting and refining so much lead to make batteries, cover cables and enrich gasoline that it was once the largest operation in the country, according to a 1949 newspaper article.

By the 1970s, researchers had proven lead was poisoning American children. Doctors in Omaha noticed kids with elevated blood-lead levels and published findings connecting the toxic metal in their bodies to the smoke pouring out of ASARCO and other polluters.

In the late 1990s, when city leaders wanted to demolish ASARCO and redevelop the site into a riverfront park, they had to figure out how to clean up Omaha’s lead legacy. They turned to the EPA, which declared a 27-square-mile swath of east Omaha a Superfund site, a federal designation that would allow the agency to clean up the contamination and try to hold the polluters responsible to pay for it.

The agency estimated the smelter, along with other polluters, had spewed about 400 million pounds of lead dust over an area, where 125,000 people, including 14,000 young children, lived.

The EPA won $246 million in settlements from ASARCO and others to fund the cleanup.

By 2015, most of the yards that tested above 400 parts per million had their soil replaced, and the EPA handed the remaining work to the city. The old smelter site was redeveloped into a science museum with a playground outside.

The project seemed like a success. The number of kids testing high for lead has dropped dramatically since the 1990s, though similar patterns exist nationwide and fewer than half the kids in the site are tested annually, according to data from the Health Department in Douglas County, where Omaha is located.

But evidence had already been emerging that the cleanup levels the EPA had set in Omaha “may not protect children,” which the agency acknowledged in 2019, during the first Trump administration. Managers wrote in a site review that “increasing evidence supports a lower blood-lead level of concern” than the 1994 health guidance that informed the cleanup plan.

Lead, even in incredibly small amounts, can build up in the brains, bones or organs of children as well as adults, said Bruce Lanphear, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada who has studied lead for decades.

“Lead represents the largest mass poison in human history,” he said.

After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lowered its blood-lead level standard, the EPA’s Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation began working on new lead cleanup guidance for the EPA regions in 2012, said James Woolford, director of the office from 2006 to 2020. The EPA took a “cautious, studied” approach to how much lead in dirt is acceptable.

“Zero was obviously the preference. But what could you do given what’s in the environment?” he asked. “And so we were kind of stuck there.”

Then, in 2024, Biden stepped in.

If regional EPA officials applied the administration’s guidance to the Omaha site, over 13,000 more properties in Omaha could have qualified, a Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica analysis of EPA and city of Omaha soil tests found.

The number could have been even higher, records show. Nearly 27,000 properties, including those that never received cleanup and those that received partial cleanup, would have been eligible for further evaluation, EPA manager Preston Law wrote to a state environmental official in March 2024.

The EPA had also been discussing with city and state officials whether to expand the cleanup area: A map that an EPA contractor created with a computer model to simulate the smelter’s plume shows that it likely stretched 23 miles north to south across five counties in Nebraska and Iowa.

But cleaning up all the properties to the Biden levels could cost more than $800 million, the then-interim director of the Nebraska Department of Energy and Environment, Thaddeus Fineran, wrote to the EPA’s administrator in May 2024.

If cleanup costs exceeded the funds set aside from Omaha’s settlements, the EPA would have to dip into the federal Superfund trust fund, which generally requires a 10% match from the state, said Ashford, the EPA spokesperson.

That could mean a contribution of $80 million or more from Nebraska, which is already facing a $471 million budget deficit. In the letter, Fineran wrote that the state would “reserve the right to challenge the Updated Lead Soil Guidance and any actions taken in furtherance thereof.”

The Nebraska Department of Water, Energy, and Environment, as the agency is now called, declined an interview, referring questions to the EPA.

Researchers and decision-makers are likely taking a cautious approach toward what they agree to clean up in Omaha, Woolford said. Given its size, it could carry weight elsewhere.

“It will set the baseline for sites across the country,” he said.

“Hollow” Claims

The Trump administration may upend any plans to expand the cleanup.

In March, the EPA announced what it called the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.” By July, about 1 in 5 employees who worked for the EPA when Trump took office were gone. The administration proposed slashing the EPA’s budget in half.

The administration promised to prioritize Superfund cleanups. But in October, it changed the lead guidance. As a result, more people will be at risk of absorbing damaging amounts of lead into their bodies, said Tom Neltner, national director for the advocacy organization Unleaded Kids.

“It signals that the claims that lead is a priority for them are hollow,” he said.

The Trump administration said Biden’s approach had “inconsistencies and inefficiencies” that led to “analysis paralysis” and slowed projects down.

“Children can’t wait years for us to put a shovel in the dirt to clean up the areas where they live and play,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

Under the guidance, the EPA could issue a lower standard for the Omaha site. But Robert Weinstock, director of Northwestern University’s Environmental Advocacy Center, said that’s unlikely unless the state sets a lower state standard than the EPA.

Trump’s guidance has some advantages in being more clear, said Filippelli of Indiana University. The Biden guidance seemed overly ambitious: Filippelli and other researchers estimated 1 in 4 American homes could have qualified for cleanup with an estimated cost of $290 billion to $1.2 trillion.

While Omaha could be the litmus test for how low the Trump EPA is willing to set cleanup standards, the new guidelines don’t inspire confidence that the administration will do more to clean up old sites where work is nearly finished.

“I imagine the inertia would be just to say, ‘Oh, we’re done with Omaha,’” he said.

The city has received no timeline from the EPA, said Steve Zivny, program manager of Omaha’s Lead Information Office. He’s guessing money will play a big part in the decision over whether to clean up at a lower lead level, though. About $90 million of the Omaha Superfund settlement remains.

“If the data is there and the science is there and the money’s there, I think we would expect it to be lowered,” Zivny said. “But there’s just so many factors that are not really in our control.”

If cleanup levels aren’t lowered in Omaha, advocates will have more work to do, said Kiley Petersmith, an assistant professor at Nebraska Methodist College who until recently oversaw a statewide blood-lead testing program.

“I think we’re just gonna have to rally together to do more to prevent it from getting from our environment into our kids,” she said.

A Buried Issue

Despite the cleanup efforts, Omahans are still exposed at higher rates compared with the national average, said Dr. Egg Qin, an epidemiologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who has studied the Superfund site. Yet the city seems to be moving on, he said.

“Somebody needs to take the responsibility,” Qin said, “to make sure the community knows lead poisoning still exists significantly in Omaha.”

About 40% of the 398 people who have already signed up to have their soil tested by Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica said they did not feel knowledgeable about the history of lead contamination in Omaha.

That may in part be due to disclosure rules. When a person sells a home, state and federal law requires them to share any knowledge about lead hazards. The EPA’s original cleanup plan from 2009 says that should include providing buyers with soil test results.

But in most cases, there can be very little disclosure, said Tim Reeder, a real estate agent who works in the Superfund site. Omaha’s association of real estate agents provides a map of the Superfund site to give to buyers, along with some basic information, if the home is within the boundaries.

City and local health officials spread the word about lead through neighborhood meetings, local TV interviews and billboards. But most people don’t take it seriously until someone they know tests high, Petersmith said.

“Unfortunately, once it affects them personally, like if their child or grandchild or cousin has lead exposure, then it’s too late,” she said.

When Omaha pediatrician Katie MacKrell moved into a house in the Dundee neighborhood, she thought her kids were fine to play in the yard. Her son sucked his thumb. Her daughter dropped her pacifier and put it back in.

When their kids both tested high for lead, MacKrell and her husband went to work fixing lead paint issues in the house. When it came to the yard, her property tested for lead levels above the Biden guidance but didn’t qualify under the original cleanup threshold. And without government help, it could cost the couple more than $10,000 to pay for the remediation themselves.

The lead also caught Vanessa Ballard, a high school teacher and mom of two young boys, by surprise. She had imagined growing fruit trees in her backyard until she discovered lead levels high enough to potentially clean up under the Biden guidelines. Now, no one goes in the backyard. Her oldest son splashes in soapy water after making tracks for his Hot Wheels cars in the dirt, and she mixes droplets of iron with the kids’ juice every night to help their bodies repel lead.

“I have no hand in the cause of this, but I have all the responsibility in the prevention of it harming me and my family,” she said.

Prine will never know whether lead stunted Jack’s speech development, but she worries about it every day.

Starting kindergarten helped. But her son is still behind other kids. Prine said she tries to put on a brave face, to believe one day he’ll catch up. If he doesn’t, it’s hard not to suspect the culprit could be in her soil.

It seemed the government, at least for a short while, agreed. Now she, and so many others in Omaha, don’t know when, if ever, to expect a solution.

“Why does it take so long, when they say it’s not safe, to then come in and say, ‘We’re gonna take this seriously?’” Prine asked. “‘That we’re gonna help these kids and protect them?’”","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251116-Gratz-NE-Lead14.jpg?resize=2000,1332",N,,2025-12-11 05:58:32.239629

The plan suggests creating a discount rate for low-income customers and banning utility shutoffs during summer heat.

Proposed regulatory changes include giving the state oversight in utility mergers and capping utility profit rates.

A recent poll indicates 87% of Indiana voters are concerned about increasing energy costs.

Indiana utility customer advocacy groups this week released a slate of ambitious reforms they say would promote affordability for struggling residential and small-business ratepayers.

The document calls for policies benefiting low-income customers, like discounts and a summertime shutoff ban, along with changes to state oversight and regulations.

“Hoosier families are stretched thin, and they need relief now from monopoly utilities who’ve pushed policies for years that led to this crisis,” said Megan Robertson, the executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters, a clean environment and energy group.

“This plan gives state leaders a clear, practical path to lower bills that will protect Hoosiers most in need and build a more affordable, reliable energy future for every community in our state,” she said.

About 87% of Hoosiers were at least “somewhat” concerned about rising energy costs — with 59% “very” concerned — in a Bellwether Research poll conducted for Indiana Conservation Voters.

The survey of 800 registered voters statewide was performed Oct. 29-30 and Nov. 1, over call and text, and carried an error margin of plus or minus 3.5%.

Robertson’s organization was joined by Citizens Action Coalition, a utility ratepayer watchdog.

“For too long, Hoosiers have been footing the bill for decisions they didn’t make and policies they didn’t ask for,” said Kerwin Olson, the coalition’s executive director.

“Indiana’s regulatory system should be built to protect consumers, but that goal can only be achieved if lawmakers give regulators the tools and authority it needs,” Olson said. “The solutions have been ready for years. The need is now incredibly urgent, and we hope lawmakers will do their part.”

The Indiana Energy Association, which represents the state’s largest electric and natural gas utilities, said the industry is “listening closely to customers, stakeholders, policymakers, and state leaders” as regular legislative work approaches.

“We recognize that many policy proposals will be considered this legislative session, and we share the concern for how the current landscape is affecting the people we serve,” association President Danielle McGrath said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “We remain committed to keeping energy reliable and affordable for our customers.”

She noted utilities already have some options for cash-strapped consumers.

“Beyond providing power, the industry plays a critical role in supporting our customers and communities. We offer a range of assistance and affordability tools that help manage costs and consumption, such as bill payment assistance, notifications and alerts, and flexible payment options,” McGrath said.

She added that Indiana’s residential energy prices are below the U.S. average and rank the lowest in the Earth North Central region — Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio — according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

The plan, however, indicated residents are still hard-hit.

“Hoosiers are paying some of the highest energy bills in the Midwest,” it read. “… Families, seniors, renters, small business owners — everyone is feeling the pain.”

White paper’s suggestions

Recommendations in the “Help Hoosiers Now Ratepayer Relief Plan” are ordered by “how quickly they will affect Hoosiers,” according to the document.

It centers on a pair of policies targeting low-income households.

Under the first, lawmakers would establish a discount rate for each of the state’s investor-owned utility companies, applicable to ratepayers who qualify as low-income. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission would set the rate, which the plan suggests could be based on a 3% or 4% income burden threshold. The concept is similar to the 30% of income standard often used for housing affordability.

The second would prohibit shutoffs during high summer temperatures for participants in Indiana’s low-income home energy assistance program. State law already bans shutoffs for such households during the winter, from Dec. 1 through March 15, according to the plan.

The organizations also aim to shake up the regulatory space. They recommended reforming IURC’s jurisdiction in mergers or acquisitions involving utilities or their parent firms.

BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners is close to purchasing AES Indiana, one of the “big five” investor-owned electric utility companies. Despite the potentially major implications, the state has no say, Axios Indianapolis reported.

Under other suggestions, lawmakers would require IURC to cap utility profit rates at the cost of capital and ban the commission from letting utilities include “political influence campaigns” in customer bills.

That would include activities related to lobbying, charitable giving, trade association expenses, litigation, investor relations and more. Utilities would file annual reports related to those activities, and the IURC would make them public.

Another proposal includes repealing or reducing cost trackers. Utilities can currently use them to adjust rates for certain expenses and recover those costs from customers on an ongoing basis.

Shrinking or getting rid of some trackers would “provide more stability in monthly bills and require utilities to go through the rate case process to pass along these costs,” the plan reads.

Other recommendations are longer-term endeavors.

That includes a revival of distributed energy generation policies, review of the state’s approach to controversial data centers and a requirement that big industrial energy-users participate in utility-led energy efficiency programs. They’d also help pay for the initiatives.

The plan additionally envisions a legislative confirmation process for IURC commissioners. The five members are appointed by the governor without lawmakers’ involvement.

And it delves into a contentious debate over utility-scale infrastructure siting. Indiana doesn’t have standards statewide, so it’s up to each of the 92 counties. Previous legislative attempts have failed amid pushback from local officials and residents.","https://www.courierpress.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/10/PEVC/87699309007-energybill-1646831272.jpg?crop=703,395,x0,y0&width=703&height=395&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-11 08:58:33.779361

The government agency purged basic facts about global warming from its website last week — including references to how human activity releases planet-heating carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

The EPA’s page explaining the causes of climate change now focuses on how “natural processes,” like variations in Earth’s orbit and in solar activity, influence the climate.

“Human causes are not even on the list, which is simply misinformation. It’s false,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources. “And moreover, it’s clearly deliberate, because a week ago, that page correctly reflected the scientific understanding of climate change.”

At least 80 pages related to climate change vanished from the EPA’s site in early December. It’s one of the most far-reaching removals of climate change information from government websites since President Donald Trump took office in January. “Up till now, we really had not seen hardly any changes on EPA pages,” said Gretchen Gehrke, who monitors federal websites with the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative.

While important resources have already disappeared from other government sites — including the National Climate Assessments, a series of congressionally mandated climate reports translated for public consumption — many of the previous changes were language swaps, replacing “climate change” with more innocuous phrases like “future conditions” or “extreme weather.” The EPA’s most recent overhaul represents a more radical rejection of mainstream science.

“Yes, there’s been climate information coming down, but so far it hasn’t actually necessarily been the nuts-and-bolts climate science information,” Swain said. “This is pretty fundamental physical science.” The resources on the EPA’s site were used by teachers, businesses, and local and tribal governments, as well as the public, since they translated the jargon-filled language of scientific reports into something more useful and accessible.

For example, the agency deleted a resource explaining the signals of a warming world — everything from rising temperatures and melting ice sheets to the damage toll on wildlife and human health — with more than 100 charts and maps. Also gone is a website quantifying the physical and economic risks. The effect is to isolate climate change from the issues that affect people’s lives, Gehrke said: “It’s specifically targeting the information about why we should care.”

In response to questions about why the EPA’s climate change resources were removed, the agency said it was upholding “gold-standard science.”

“Unlike the previous administration, the Trump EPA is focused on protecting human health and the environment while Powering the Great American Comeback, not left-wing political agendas,” an EPA spokesperson said in a statement. “As such, this agency no longer takes marching orders from the climate cult.”

Swain said the changes could be a way for the EPA to bring its public-facing information in line with the proposal to reverse the agency’s own “endangerment finding,” the scientific basis that allows the EPA to regulate carbon emissions. The agency is expected to finalize the repeal soon, in what EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has promised to be “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

The changes to the EPA’s site are reminiscent of a report the Department of Energy released this summer, written by a group of five climate contrarians, arguing that climate change wasn’t as bad as mainstream scientists say. It can give people the impression that there’s a “debate” that climate change is a serious problem, when in fact there’s not, Swain said. If anything, the last several years suggest that the consequences of the warming that’s already arrived are worse than many scientists expected.

Official government websites used to be a source of unbiased information, but as federal agencies have altered them to align with the Trump administration’s talking points, some are becoming unreliable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently changed its stance on the relationship between vaccines and autism, with a new page saying that a link between the two can’t be ruled out — horrifying current staffers, who said their employer was spreading misinformation. Most information on government sites remains trustworthy, though. The National Weather Service, for instance, is still putting out accurate weather reports.

“Until very recently, despite all of the damage that has been done to trust in government institutions over the last several years, I would say that the government websites, agency websites, still were among the most trusted sources,” Gehrke said. “And I do worry that that is really slipping away very quickly.”

The result is that the public is left to navigate a landscape where some government agencies are sharing credible facts, while others are generating misinformation. At the same time, quality, unbiased information just isn’t as easy to access as it used to be. Search results increasingly turn up AI-generated slop, while social media algorithms serve up posts targeted to individual preferences, giving people an off-kilter picture of reality.

“Siloed information is really tearing apart society,” Gehrke said. “People are making logical choices and logical analyses based on the information they have, but they are working with completely different sets of information. And that is a real problem.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EPA-sign-behind-tree.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-12-11 05:58:38.069918

Some critics of the governor, however, say that such reasoning is shortsighted in the face of the existential threat of climate change. Environmental activists and some officials in her own party have accused Ms. Hochul of abandoning the state’s climate law for politically expedient reasons; the governor faces a re-election bid next year.

“We’re in a moment where it’s incredibly important for New York State to lead on energy affordability and climate,” said Liz Moran, a New York policy advocate for Earthjustice, an environmental nonprofit. “Unfortunately over the past year, we’ve seen the governor run toward the opposite direction.”

While some business leaders support the governor’s push to use more natural gas and nuclear energy to supply the state’s grid, critics say that her focus on affordability has shaped several policy decisions that have undermined the state’s climate goals.

Some of Ms. Hochul’s moves in the past year have alarmed climate activists and like-minded Democratic leaders. She has embraced energy-hungry tech ventures, including a bitcoin mining operation in the Finger Lakes region. State officials recently agreed to a settlement, after years of litigation, to extend the life of the gas plant that powers the facility. She also backed a plan for an offshore natural gas pipeline near New York City that had previously been rejected three times because of environmental concerns.

Ms. Hochul’s administration delayed the implementation of an all-electric buildings law passed in 2023 that would have banned gas power in a wide swath of new construction. And the governor has not taken full advantage of a 2023 law that enables the state to develop publicly owned renewable-energy projects, though Ms. Hochul was among those who cheered a judge’s decision this week to strike down President Trump’s halt on wind projects on federal property.

Perhaps the loudest complaints, however, are tied to the 2019 climate law. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the ambitious legislation calls for New York to get 70 percent of its electricity from renewable sources like wind, solar and hydropower by 2030 and to shift entirely to carbon-free power a decade later.

But the state is at least six years late in meeting its first target of a 40 percent decrease in planet-warming pollution by 2030. And full implementation of the law is not possible without its accompanying regulations, which the state is two years late in putting into effect. The sticking point is the centerpiece of the law, called cap and invest, which would charge polluters for exceeding emissions limits and use those proceeds to invest in renewable projects and energy-efficiency initiatives.

In the spring, several environmental groups, including Earthjustice, sued the state, arguing that it was in violation of the climate law. By October, a judge agreed, ordering officials to publish the missing regulations by early February. The governor has appealed, saying she needs more time to review and possibly amend the rules.

Ms. Hochul’s delay is similar to her approach to the rollout of congestion pricing in 2024, when she temporarily paused the tolling program to consider the financial burden on New Yorkers, said Michael B. Gerrard, an environmental law professor at Columbia.

Requiring fossil fuel companies to pay fees through a cap and invest program, Mr. Gerrard said, could lead to an increase in some consumer prices, like the cost of electricity. In New York, where power rates are already 50 percent higher than the national average, natural gas remains the largest source of fuel for electricity.

In a poll this year, most New Yorkers surveyed said they believed that keeping energy costs low was more important than decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.

State Senator Liz Krueger said that the cap and invest program would help accomplish both those aims. Her office cited one report that said households making under $200,000 a year would benefit from the policies subsidized by the program.

New York is still a leader on clean energy, Mr. Lovett of the governor’s office said. The state has exceeded its goals for the generation of solar energy, and supported two key private projects: a major offshore wind farm near Long Island and a transmission line that will deliver hydropower from Canada to New York City next year, he said. Ms. Hochul also announced a $1 billion investment fund earmarked for various renewable projects, including emissions reduction, over the next five years.

Critics of Ms. Hochul’s climate agenda have said they would also like to see the climate law back on track. The law’s cap and invest program has the potential to raise $5 billion a year or more, said Justin Flagg, the director of communications and environmental policy for Ms. Krueger.

And some of the business ventures backed by the governor are the same ones stoking the growing demand for energy.

Ms. Hochul wants to make the state a hub for tech companies, which can be energy-intensive. Currently in development is a $100 billion memory chip facility in Central New York that is projected to gobble up enough electricity to power nearly 1.5 million homes. Supporters of the project point out that as many as 50,000 jobs could be created.

New York’s business ambitions and emissions reduction goals are working at cross purposes, said Zilvinas Silenas, president of the Empire Center for Public Policy, an Albany think tank. “They are a train wreck in slow motion.”

The state faces an increase of up to 24 percent in annual electricity demand by 2040, according to the most recent draft of its energy plan. Aware of the mounting needs, Ms. Hochul has endorsed an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy instead of a singular focus on renewables. This, she has said, should help keep utility bills low.

Some experts say that these solutions, however, are time-consuming to build and expensive. Nuclear plants take years to construct and cost billions of dollars, and utility customers often end up footing the bill for gas infrastructure.

This month, Ms. Hochul has an opportunity to curb gas costs by amending a law that requires utilities to provide automatic gas hookups to new customers. Getting rid of the rule could result in about $581 million of savings on bills every year, according to a new analysis.

The governor is reviewing the legislation, Mr. Lovett said.

Ms. Krueger called the repeal of the rule, as well as programs like cap and invest, “critical affordability measures that we can’t afford to delay.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/11/multimedia/11met-climate-hochul-01-gfcw/11met-climate-hochul-01-gfcw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 07:59:02.080765

As energy demand is set to double in the coming years, this infrastructure programme is strengthening the UK’s capability in critical industries to power the UKs future.

Sumitomo Electric’s involvement marks a major milestone with the return of high-voltage direct current cable manufacturing to the UK for the first time in more than 20 years. The company’s £350 million investment at the Port of Nigg in Scotland will create around 150 skilled jobs, bolster local supply chains, and re-establish long-term industrial capability on British shores.

Alongside these national benefits, National Grid is committed to ensuring local communities also benefit from economic uplift. By working closely with Chambers of Commerce across Kent, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk, the company will help grow regional supply chains and look to expand skills opportunities across the south and east of England.

Together, these national and regional partnerships underline National Grid’s commitment to strengthening UK supply chains, supporting home-grown manufacturing, and investing in the skilled workforce needed to deliver a cleaner, more secure, home-grown energy future.

While the announcement of contract award for Sumitomo Electric, and Siemens Energy marks a positive step forward for the Sea Link project, it does not influence the ongoing development consent application. The application is currently under review by the Planning Inspectorate, ensuring that all aspects of the project are carefully considered.

Carl Trowell, President of Strategic Infrastructure at National Grid, said:

The Great Grid Upgrade is more than an energy programme, it is one of the UK’s biggest engines of economic growth. By investing in skills, securing our supply chain, and working with world-class partners like Siemens Energy and Sumitomo Electric, we are supporting tens of thousands of high-quality jobs and the manufacturing capability the UK needs for the long term.

The £1billion Energy Engineered in the UK (EEUK) programme will mobilise public and private investment to unlock critical supply chains and create thousands of skilled jobs.

As part of this programme, GBE is opening its £300 million GBE Supply Chain Fund: Offshore Wind & Networks, designed to tackle urgent bottlenecks in key components such as blades, turbines, transmission cables and converter stations.

This investment will build manufacturing capacity and ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of offshore wind deployment and electricity network innovation.

The fund is a key part of the UK Government's modern Industrial Strategy which sets out a ten-year plan to boost investment, create good skilled jobs and make Britain the best place to do business.

GBE will work alongside partners including the National Wealth Fund, Scottish National Infrastructure Bank, and The Crown Estate to unlock financing for large-scale manufacturing projects.

To cement the UK’s position as a global leader in deepwater offshore wind, GBE is also establishing a Deepwater Wind Commercialisation Programme in partnership with FLOWEX, bringing together industry leaders to unlock the industrial opportunity from the next frontier of offshore wind deployment.

With strong public backing and collaboration across government and industry, Energy Engineered in the UK will deliver:

High-value manufacturing capacity in the UK

Skilled, well-paid jobs for communities across the country

A resilient supply chain for future low-carbon technologies

Great British Energy CEO, Dan McGrail, said: ""Great British Energy is investing in British industry, we are helping to create jobs, driving innovation, and ensuring clean energy infrastructure is built here in the UK.

“This programme is about more than funding; it will help overcome the current challenges and ensure the benefits of a world-class supply chain are felt in communities across the country.”

Energy Minister, Michael Shanks, said: “We want our clean energy future to be built here in Britain as part of our modern Industrial Strategy.

“This fund will boost our manufacturing capabilities for offshore wind – supporting jobs and growth in communities across the country.”

Great British Energy Director of Supply Chains, Rob Gilbert, said: “Energy, Engineered in the UK, is a national initiative to drive down technology costs, crowd in private finance, and use our unique role between the public and private sector to support structured market interventions.

“This programme will help the UK energy sector to learn collectively, scale deliberately, and compete globally – not just on cost, but on homegrown, long-term capability. This will create jobs, economic growth, and energy security for all areas of the UK.”

Meanwhile, communities in Aberdeen and the North-east are to benefit from new funding to support renewable energy projects.

The support comes through a combination of Scottish Government and Great British Energy funding, the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme's (CARES) Community Energy Generation Growth Fund will provide grants for equipment, installation and feasibility work.

The Scottish government has received an additional £5.5million from Great British Energy, and has so far allocated £1.8million to 23 projects across the country.

Among those, Robert Gordon University is to receive £23,600 for the decarbonisation of its sports hall.

King's Church in Aberdeen will also receive £102,334 for a solar PV project.

A total of £20,000 is being made available to Birse Community Trust in Banchory, which is carrying out a hydro power feasibility study.

This year, the Community Energy Generation Growth Fund has made a total of 71 funding offers - totalling more than £7.3million - to community energy projects across the country.

Speaking ahead of the CARES conference, Climate Action and Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said: ""Community-led energy projects are at the heart of Scotland's journey to net zero. By empowering local groups to generate their own clean energy with local solutions, we are not only cutting emissions but also reducing costs and creating resilient communities. These projects show what can be achieved when people come together with a shared vision for a sustainable future.

“This funding is giving communities the tools and confidence to take control of their own energy needs, keep money circulating locally, and build a fairer, greener economy.

“Scotland's transition to net zero must be inclusive and fair, and community energy is a vital part of ensuring that everyone benefits from the opportunities of a clean energy future.""

He wants to quadruple the U.S.’s nuclear power by 2050.

And Trump isn’t the only president who has lauded the power of nuclear energy; former President Joe Biden also thought it could be a solution to some of the country’s energy problems.

As electricity demand rises, politicians are reconsidering a power source long plagued by high costs and lengthy construction timelines. How big a role will nuclear play in the country’s future energy mix?

Katy Huff, associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, was the Department of Energy’s assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy from 2022 to 2024.

“ If you work backwards from net-zero goals by 2050, for example, then you need an incredible amount of nuclear energy,” Huff said. “It rivals the fastest rate that we’ve ever produced new nuclear power plants in this country.”

5 questions with Katy Huff

We’ve only seen two new nuclear reactors come online in the past decade, at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia in 2023. Those reactors were seven years late and $17 billion over budget. Why is it so difficult to build this stuff?

“ Delays and cost overruns are often because each nuclear power plant build is treated as a first-of-a-kind project. You know, imagine trying to build a commercial airplane when every single part has to be custom-designed and approved by the regulator for the first time. That’s really slow and expensive until you get to a place where you no longer have to approve those parts and design approaches and construction processes.

“But ideally, if you can build more of them on a quick pace shortly after the first few, then you should see some lessons learned. But new reactor designs are also being proposed as well, and they’ll face those first-of-a-kind risks for the first few units.”

One promising technology that we’ve been hearing about for years is something called a small modular reactor. They’re smaller than these typical nuclear plants and, in theory, they’re cheaper and easier to get the permitting for.

How likely are those at this point to play a big role in the future energy mix?

“ I think because those capital costs are going to be lower per unit because they’re a little bit more flexible in terms of deployment in fleets. The hope is that we’ll also get to that nth-of-a-kind quicker if each unit is smaller, but per megawatt hour generated, they probably will be slightly more expensive than the bigger units, which get economies of scale.

“How realistic is it that they’re being built? Well, some of them are being built right now.”

The Biden administration was looking to nuclear power to fulfill some of its climate priorities, but Trump is interested for different reasons. He’s promising $80 billion to build nuclear reactors.

His energy secretary, Chris Wright, said on CNBC last month that early projects will receive government subsidies. How does that sound to you?

“ Because of the enormous capital investment required to build a big, complex, precise machine, government support has played a key role in unlocking private investment, especially through the loan programs office.

“But just as important are those committed customers, whether it’s companies like Dow Chemical or chip manufacturers or data centers. That early demand also helps to reduce risk and build those first few reactors, after which we hope the costs will come down rapidly.”

What is a reasonable timeline for a nuclear revival like this? If we’re talking about meeting electricity demand that’s rising rapidly right now, is a nuclear build-out too slow to be of much help?

“ I think that is a real concern. In order to meet that moment, you’re going to have to build nuclear power plants on time and on budget, even if those budgets are fairly high initially.

“And some of those schedules will take a decade to get a reactor online from start of construction to connection to the grid. Though there is certainly a hope that some smaller reactors might get from construction to grid connection quicker, time will tell, and we’ll have to see whether the U.S. engineering and construction companies involved in these projects are ready for that challenge.”

Have we figured out a solution to the safety problem? Is there still an issue of what to do with nuclear waste?

“ First, it’s important to know that over the last 60, 70 years of commercial nuclear energy in the us, our spent nuclear fuel has never harmed anyone. And while there’s ongoing work in the Department of Energy about where to store it long term, that fuel is currently safely stored at reactor sites right now.

“Reactors themselves have historically been extremely safe in the United States. Even the Three Mile Island accident, which is the worst in our history, killed no one.

“And we have real hopes that some of the passive safety features of this current generation of proposed and existing new construction will be even safer. But it requires strong regulation, and I hope to see that that continues.”

The BrightDrop vans reportedly are 2024 models, sold to Amazon in 2023, even before the brand was folded into the larger Chevrolet umbrella.

Production paused

In April of this year, GM temporarily paused production of the vans at its CAMI assembly plant in Ontario, laying off 500 workers. Past October, GM announced it was discontinuing BrightDrop entirely – ending the e-LCV only four years after its debut.

Justifying the decision, GM said BrightDrop suffered from weak demand for commercial electric vans in North America, changes in incentive structures (including the end of U.S. EV tax credits), and underutilization of production capacity.

From Amazon’s side, the test appears exploratory, a chance to regularly test various vehicle options, rather than a full-scale shift away from Rivian, which by mid-2025 had delivered about 20,000 of the 100,000 e-LCVs it was contracted in 2019 to deliver by 2030. This constitutes the bulk of Amazon electric delivery vehicles, which number around 35,000 worldwide.

Real-world deployment

The visibility of BrightDrop vans in cities such as Seattle, where Amazon delivery drivers have been spotted using them, indicates real-world deployment for the pilot.

However, the discontinuation of the model also holds a cautionary tale for the e-LCV sector. BrightDrop’s failure – despite backing by GM and interest from Amazon – shows that the transition to electric delivery vans remains extremely challenging in the U.S., given current market and regulatory conditions.

Despite the discontinuation of BrightDrop, and the less than optimal regulatory environment, GM is partnering with Hyundai to develop a new e-LCV for the U.S. market, slated for launch in 2028. This is an indication that GM is merely recalibrating, not ending, its e-LCV ambitions.

So perhaps e-LCVs in the U.S. are not dead yet. To succeed, however, the segment needs better timing, clear incentives, and more compelling value propositions to fleet operators.

He wants to quadruple the U.S.’s nuclear power by 2050.

And Trump isn’t the only president who has lauded the power of nuclear energy; former President Joe Biden also thought it could be a solution to some of the country’s energy problems.

As electricity demand rises, politicians are reconsidering a power source long plagued by high costs and lengthy construction timelines. How big a role will nuclear play in the country’s future energy mix?

Katy Huff, associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, was the Department of Energy’s assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy from 2022 to 2024.

“ If you work backwards from net-zero goals by 2050, for example, then you need an incredible amount of nuclear energy,” Huff said. “It rivals the fastest rate that we’ve ever produced new nuclear power plants in this country.”

5 questions with Katy Huff

We’ve only seen two new nuclear reactors come online in the past decade, at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia in 2023. Those reactors were seven years late and $17 billion over budget. Why is it so difficult to build this stuff?

“ Delays and cost overruns are often because each nuclear power plant build is treated as a first-of-a-kind project. You know, imagine trying to build a commercial airplane when every single part has to be custom-designed and approved by the regulator for the first time. That’s really slow and expensive until you get to a place where you no longer have to approve those parts and design approaches and construction processes.

“But ideally, if you can build more of them on a quick pace shortly after the first few, then you should see some lessons learned. But new reactor designs are also being proposed as well, and they’ll face those first-of-a-kind risks for the first few units.”

One promising technology that we’ve been hearing about for years is something called a small modular reactor. They’re smaller than these typical nuclear plants and, in theory, they’re cheaper and easier to get the permitting for.

How likely are those at this point to play a big role in the future energy mix?

“ I think because those capital costs are going to be lower per unit because they’re a little bit more flexible in terms of deployment in fleets. The hope is that we’ll also get to that nth-of-a-kind quicker if each unit is smaller, but per megawatt hour generated, they probably will be slightly more expensive than the bigger units, which get economies of scale.

“How realistic is it that they’re being built? Well, some of them are being built right now.”

The Biden administration was looking to nuclear power to fulfill some of its climate priorities, but Trump is interested for different reasons. He’s promising $80 billion to build nuclear reactors.

His energy secretary, Chris Wright, said on CNBC last month that early projects will receive government subsidies. How does that sound to you?

“ Because of the enormous capital investment required to build a big, complex, precise machine, government support has played a key role in unlocking private investment, especially through the loan programs office.

“But just as important are those committed customers, whether it’s companies like Dow Chemical or chip manufacturers or data centers. That early demand also helps to reduce risk and build those first few reactors, after which we hope the costs will come down rapidly.”

What is a reasonable timeline for a nuclear revival like this? If we’re talking about meeting electricity demand that’s rising rapidly right now, is a nuclear build-out too slow to be of much help?

“ I think that is a real concern. In order to meet that moment, you’re going to have to build nuclear power plants on time and on budget, even if those budgets are fairly high initially.

“And some of those schedules will take a decade to get a reactor online from start of construction to connection to the grid. Though there is certainly a hope that some smaller reactors might get from construction to grid connection quicker, time will tell, and we’ll have to see whether the U.S. engineering and construction companies involved in these projects are ready for that challenge.”

Have we figured out a solution to the safety problem? Is there still an issue of what to do with nuclear waste?

“ First, it’s important to know that over the last 60, 70 years of commercial nuclear energy in the us, our spent nuclear fuel has never harmed anyone. And while there’s ongoing work in the Department of Energy about where to store it long term, that fuel is currently safely stored at reactor sites right now.

“Reactors themselves have historically been extremely safe in the United States. Even the Three Mile Island accident, which is the worst in our history, killed no one.

“And we have real hopes that some of the passive safety features of this current generation of proposed and existing new construction will be even safer. But it requires strong regulation, and I hope to see that that continues.”

Speaking in Paris before the deal was unveiled, he described the region as a clear example of how cheaper Chinese vehicles were reshaping the global automotive landscape.

Central to the agreement is the development of two small electric models for Ford, built using Renault technology. The first vehicle, which will be manufactured at a Renault factory in northern France, is scheduled to reach European customers in 2028. Jim says these cars would be smaller than any electric models Ford is planning for the US and would address a missing segment in the company’s European range.

Alongside passenger cars, the two groups will jointly engineer vans sold under both brands across Europe. Farley said the combined scale of the partnership could create a formidable force in the light commercial vehicle market, making it far harder for new Chinese entrants to gain ground.

While Chinese van brands have yet to make a major impact in Europe, he noted that competition with Chinese manufacturers is already intense in emerging markets. Renault chief executive François Provost said Chinese companies were expected to arrive in Europe in greater numbers and that delaying collaboration would be a strategic mistake.

Analysts see the partnership as mutually beneficial. In a research note, Oddo-BHF analyst Michael Foundoukidis says the deal would help Renault spread its fixed costs and improve factory utilisation, while allowing Ford to enter the affordable EV segment via a “capital-light” route. He added that alliances of this kind were becoming essential for traditional carmakers facing structurally lower-cost Chinese competitors.

The agreement emerged after Renault executives visited Ford’s headquarters in Detroit earlier this year. Both sides stressed that cooperation would remain limited to specific projects and that there were no plans for a merger.

Ford’s European presence has weakened in recent years, with its passenger car market share falling from just over 6% in 2019 to about 3.3% during the first ten months of this year. As part of a wider overhaul, the company has reduced its workforce and closed its Saarlouis plant in Germany.

The US manufacturer is also under financial strain as it invests simultaneously in conventional engines and expensive electric technology, particularly following the withdrawal of EV incentives by President Donald Trump’s administration.

By adopting Renault’s electric platforms and combining them with its own design language, Ford hopes to compete more effectively in Europe against established players and against Chinese brands. Ford already uses Volkswagen platforms for two European electric models and collaborates with the German group on vans, with Jim Farley saying the new Renault partnership would sit alongside that relationship.

Renault, meanwhile, stands to gain greater production scale. As Europe’s smallest mainstream carmaker, it does not sell vehicles in China or the United States, the world’s largest automotive markets. Partnering with Ford increases factory output and helps reduce the heavy costs associated with developing new electric vehicles.

The French group is actively expanding its network of alliances. From 2026, it plans to build vehicles in Brazil using platforms supplied by China’s Geely, and it is in talks with other manufacturers, including Chery, over further joint ventures.

François Provost says Renault’s long-term goal was to prove that electric cars could be produced in Europe at globally competitive costs, matching Chinese efficiency while retaining European manufacturing.",https://dealerfloor.co.za/assets/gallery/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/25FordRenau1.jpg?mtime=1765362188,N,,2025-12-11 02:59:50.660209

Ohio’s General Assembly voted in June to reduce funding for the state’s H2Ohio program by more than $100 million

The program was founded in 2019 by Gov. Mike DeWine, after toxic algal blooms threatened Toledo's water supply. The goal of H2Ohio is to improve and protect the state’s freshwater resources through a network of organizations across the state.

Those organizations include the Ohio Department of Agriculture, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, and Ohio Department Natural Resources.

""That includes the ag industry and includes private septic systems. It includes municipality septic systems, industrial discharge and then working on our best filters that are out there and those are those natural wetlands,"" said Brian Baldridge, director of the Ohio Department of Agriculture.

Ohio's farms are included in the conversation because a major part of that program is helping farmers by giving them money to help reduce their runoff from crop fertilization.

Baldridge said farmer participation has been linked to a decrease in algae blooms due to a reduction in phosphorus runoff from fertilizer.

""The 2023 data, we know the projected and modeling decrease reduction in phosphorus was about 232,000 pounds. And then we take that in 2024, that number continues to grow because of the increase in acres we have participating,"" he said. ""In 2024 that takes our projected reduction in phosphorous to about 420,000 pounds.""

Joy Mullinex, executive director of the Ohio Lake Erie Commission, who helps coordinate the H2Ohio program, said these numbers seem to be backed by the U.S. EPA who did research into reductions of phosphorus since 2008.

""They have seen an 8% to 10% reduction in phosphorus going into Lake Erie. So their work doesn't indicate exactly what it is that has led to that reduction but without a doubt the agricultural BMPs and wetlands efforts are part of that equation as well"" she said.

Baldridge said multiple members of the ag commodity community advocated for the program. The General Assembly, however, still voted to reduce H2Ohio’s budget from $270 million to just shy of $165 million.

But Baldridge said this is still a better number than earlier versions of the budget which would have cut funding to $150 million.

""Being a past legislator, I've lived through those processes a few times and it's different chambers, different conversations, different levels of support,"" he said. ""But first off I have to say, the state legislature has been tremendously supportive of the H2Ohio program.""

As part of this year's funding cut, the Ohio Department of Agriculture’s budget was reduced by 11%, pushing them to decrease payments made to farmers in the program.

Despite these cuts, Baldridge said they are still in a good spot.

“The challenge becomes as we envision the growth in the future,"" he said. ""So you take an 11% decrease on this budget cycle and we still have high goals to continue to pull in and engage more producers.”

Beyond the ag sector, other state programs have had to shift operations to meet this reduced budget. Mullinex said certain types of work have been scaled back or eliminated to get ""the best bang for their buck.""

""We scaled back a little bit on some of the acid mine drainage work being funded through H2Ohio,"" she said. ""Some of the data collection on sentinel species in the rivers, we have done some muscle monitoring, so some of that work has been scaled back. Some of river coastline restoration work, preservation work, will be scaled back.""

With other programs taking a backseat, Mullinex said she believes they can still make a lasting impact on Ohio's water quality over time.

The program is also looking for other funding sources including the Ohio EPA who have utilized federal EPA funds through the state revolving loan fund.

""One [other] great federal investment has been the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative,"" Mullinex said. ""It has received somewhere between $360 million and $400 million from Congress for several years and so, they've been a great collaborator and partner.""

Going forward, Mullinex said they are grateful for the public's patience as they sort through the details of a new funding cycle for H2Ohio.

""While we are seeing progress and it is fantastic, just know that it took us many years to get to the situation where we have harmful algal blooms recurring out on the lake and it will take a few more years before we will have results out in the lake where you can see a reduced algal bloom size,"" she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8b4549/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x2873+0+388/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2Ffb%2F08a462f2425eafc0c9ff07214e66%2F52907215562-de47195db5-o.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 03:58:10.446150

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) today announced the release of proposed regulations to strengthen the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) to achieve affordable and effective reductions in pollutants contributing to extreme heat, damaging flooding, and other harmful climate impacts. The regulatory updates follow a multi-state comprehensive stakeholder program review that ensures access to sufficient RGGI emissions reduction allowances to meet expected energy demand and bolsters price protection for consumers.

“As New York and other states encounter rollbacks on the federal level when it comes to climate action, our commitment and partnership through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is advancing energy affordability and reliability, while reducing pollution,” DEC Commissioner Amanda Lefton said. “The proposed updates to RGGI are a strong example of how states can work together with an eye towards affordability to achieve emissions reductions that will improve air quality, protect our environment, invest in clean energy, and create healthier communities.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “NYSERDA continues to support the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and furthering efforts to reduce harmful emissions while ensuring price stability and affordability. In a time when New York and other states are facing federal headwinds, these proposed updates demonstrate a collective solidarity among states to continue to take action to ensure the health and well-being of our neighborhoods and communities in New York and beyond.”

In the face of federal rollbacks, DEC and NYSERDA’s proposals confirm New York’s commitment to energy affordability, climate resilience, and public health protection. RGGI continues to perform better than expected when the bipartisan program first launched more than 15 years ago. Emissions of carbon dioxide from the power sector in New York State reduced by more than 50 percent from 2005 levels and the energy transition is made more affordable statewide, with auction proceeds totaling more than $3 billion to date.

The funds support investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and electrification that ultimately provide savings to utility ratepayers. Net savings to participating ratepayers are expected to reach nearly $12 billion over the lifetime of the investments, providing a nearly 6-to-1 benefit based on investments of approximately $2 billion to date. In addition, an independent analysis(link is external) found all RGGI states also realized $5.7 billion in public health benefits over its first six years alone (2009-2014), including fewer premature deaths, heart attacks, and respiratory illnesses thanks to cleaner air, and added 48,000 job-years. Additional investments are expected as RGGI continues.

DEC’s proposed RGGI updates would reduce the regional emissions cap to approximately 69.8 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2027, then decline 89 percent relative to the 2024 cap through 2037. This would result in carbon dioxide emissions decreasing by approximately 10 percent annually through 2033, followed by 3 percent annually until 2037. The updated cap trajectory, which would result in a regional cap reduction of more than 60 million tons of carbon dioxide to approximately nine million tons in 2037 and subsequent years, was determined through consensus among participating states following consideration of stakeholder feedback and technical modeling and analysis.

DEC and NYSERDA, in its role as the administrator of auctions and the investment of auction proceeds, also proposed draft regulations to increase the size of the Cost Containment Reserve (CCR) and establish a second tier of CCR allowances to ensure availability of RGGI allowances to meet grid reliability needs, ensure affordability, and protect against cost volatility. In addition, the joint proposal would remove the Emissions Containment Reserve from RGGI design and increase the minimum reserve price to also help protect against price volatility in the RGGI market.

Updates to NYSERDA’s auction rule must be approved by NYSERDA’s Board. On November 17, 2025, the Board passed a resolution to approve publication of the proposed changes.

The proposed regulations and proposed auction rule are available on DEC’s website. Public comments will be accepted through February 17, 2026. DEC and NYSERDA will hold two virtual public hearings on February 9, 2026, at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.

Following the public comment period, DEC and NYSERDA will work expeditiously to respond to public comments and anticipate adoption of a final regulation next year, in advance of 2027 when the updated emissions cap is slated to go into effect.

In July, the states participating in RGGI, including New York, announced the finalized program updates(link is external) to strengthen the regional emissions cap. The updated program review secures progress through the tightened cap while providing additional flexibility if extra price protection is needed. The next program review is expected to begin no later than 2028.

On Monday, December 1, DEC also announced final regulations for Part 253 establishing a Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The rule will protect against anticipated federal rollbacks and improve New York’s understanding of sources of greenhouse gas emissions, more effectively monitor the State’s progress toward pollution reduction goals, and support the production of the annual GHG Emissions Report.

It’s about how we live our lives. It’s about the natural world and other species. The warming of the Earth is affecting everything — the cost of your coffee, chocolate and jeans. … It’s just everything.”

Before The New York Times, Layton spent 23 years as a reporter and editor at The Washington Post. During the pandemic, she was recruited by the Times to serve as deputy editor of the climate desk, and this year she was promoted to climate editor. She spoke with E&P about a 2025 reporting series, “50 States: 50 Fixes.”

“We wanted to show that there are people across the country, in red states and blue states, regardless of politics, who do care about the environment and are trying to make a change and to improve things,” she said.

Climate reporters Cara Buckley and Catrin Einhorn were the two primary journalists assigned to “50 States: 50 Fixes.” Visual Editor Claire O’Neill, Photo Editors Matt McCann and Elijah Walker and other newsroom staff were also integral.

“We wanted to make sure that we had a really good reflection of the country. … And we wanted to make sure that whatever it was we were spotlighting was a real solution, a real fix,” the editor explained.

One installment takes readers to Arizona, to a car-free community; in Connecticut, shucked oyster shells are now being recycled and used to rebuild oyster habitats in Long Island Sound. In Louisiana, rain gardens are mitigating flooding. From each state comes a solution. None of them will single-handedly change the trajectory of climate change, Layton stipulates, but they are examples of practical ways people are making small yet still impactful changes to better their communities.

They created a landing page.

“Conventional wisdom at The New York Times is that landing pages, they used to be really popular, and then they sort of fell out of favor,” Layton said. “But we decided that we were going to do a landing page, because we wanted to have a place where readers who are engaged in the series want to spend time. … It turns out we were right, and the landing page is really popular,” Layton explained.

The stories are visually compelling, with photography and video complements.

“We started getting responses from readers, which was really the most heartening part of this project. We included a call-out in many of the stories, inviting people to write in and tell us what’s happening in their neighborhood and community. To date, we have more than 3,000 messages. And we’re getting fan mail and comments … verbal bouquets from readers, thanking us and asking us for more. It means we have struck a chord. People are responding to these stories,” said Layton.

They also learned that their audience values real-world, practical and locally focused news on climate and the environment. “It’s not all about polar bears at the North Pole. It is about the drought your farm is facing. It’s about the flood that destroyed your neighborhood, and about the wildfires that raged through L.A., which everybody was so shocked by. The impacts of climate change are felt everywhere. There's really no escaping from it. We’re talking about summers where heat waves are really punishing. We’re talking about downpours that dump an extraordinary amount of water in your community. These things aren’t distant. You can feel them. You can see them, wherever you are in this country and elsewhere. … It is at your doorstep.”",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/editorandpublisher/original/20251203-150003-976-TOP.png.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 05:59:23.493166

According to the study, the half-RIN option still allows imports to be used but makes domestic feedstocks, including soybean oil, more competitive.
The EPA’s pending volume rule already projects record biomass-based diesel use, which would support domestic crushing and soybean oil utilization.
Soybean oil used in biofuels would drop 2.4 billion pounds in 2026 and 3.3 billion pounds in 2027.
Soybean oil used in biofuels would still fall by 600 million pounds in 2026 and 200 million pounds in 2027.","WASHINGTON, DC, US — A new economic analysis weighing the impact of a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal regarding biofuels Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits showed it would support healthy demand for US soybeans, according to the American Soybean Association (ASA).

The EPA is considering assigning 50% of the RIN credits to imported biofuels and biofuels made from imported feedstocks compared to domestic, which the study indicated would support soybean markets while protecting flexibility in biomass-based diesel sourcing, the ASA said.

The study, funded by the United Soybean Board and conducted by World Agricultural Economic and Environmental Services (WAEES), evaluated feedstock demand, farmer income and commodity pricing under different final decisions for the EPA’s proposed 2026–2027 Renewable Fuel Standard volumes.

The half-RIN proposal ensures that imported feedstocks remain available for biofuel producers but reduces policy incentives to substitute foreign oils for US soybean oil, the ASA said.

According to the study, the half-RIN option still allows imports to be used but makes domestic feedstocks, including soybean oil, more competitive. The EPA’s pending volume rule already projects record biomass-based diesel use, which would support domestic crushing and soybean oil utilization.

Researchers modeled three scenarios and found that the half-RIN approach delivers the greatest economic benefit to US soybean farmers across every major metric evaluated, the ASA noted. Removing the 50% credit reduction, even if the EPA later adjusts blending volumes, would reduce the value of US soybeans, lower demand for domestic soybean oil, and increase reliance on imported used cooking oil and tallow as biofuel feedstocks.

If the RVO is finalized without the half RIN:

Soy cash receipts would fall $2.1 billion for the 2026-27 crop and $2 billion for 2027-28.

The value of soybean oil and meal would decline $4.8 billion in 2026-27 and $6 billion in 2027-28.

Soybean oil used in biofuels would drop 2.4 billion pounds in 2026 and 3.3 billion pounds in 2027.

Foreign imports of tallow and used cooking oil would increase by 2.3 billion pounds in 2026 and 2.4 billion pounds in 2027, displacing domestic soybean demand.

Even if the EPA attempts a compromise:

A scenario where the EPA raises 2026–27 biofuel volume obligations to offset removal of the half RIN still reduces soy farmer income by $800 million in 2026-27 and $500 million in 2027-28.

Soybean oil used in biofuels would still fall by 600 million pounds in 2026 and 200 million pounds in 2027.

Imports of used cooking oil and tallow would still surge, increasing by 2.8 billion pounds in 2026 and 3.1 billion pounds in 2027.

“Soybean farmers support strong biomass-based diesel markets,” said Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA and a Kentucky farmer. “This study confirms that when policy values domestic feedstocks, rural communities benefit. The half RIN proposal still gives biofuel producers flexibility, but it keeps American soybeans competitive and keeps more value here at home.”

The full report, Implications for Biofuels and Feedstock Demand of the Granting of Full or Half RIN Credits on Imports, is available from the ASA upon request.",https://www.world-grain.com/ext/resources/2024/03/26/soy_biofuels_biodiesel_JJ-GOUIN---STOCK.ADOBE.COM_e.jpg?height=635&t=1711463060&width=1200,N,,2025-12-11 03:58:14.292709

Even some of BMW's 2026 model year cars won't be able to charge at a Supercharging station until next year.
As of this week, most BMW EVs will finally have access to Tesla's Supercharging network.
BMW confirmed to InsideEVs that these models—the 2026 BMW i5 and 2026 BMW iX—will not receive Supercharging access until ""Q1 2025"", which ends on March 31.
BMW has already committed to going NACS-native on future models starting with the 2026 BMW i5 M60.","BMW owners officially get Tesla Supercharger access this week.

Not all BMW EVs will be able to use the charging network, though.

Even some of BMW's 2026 model year cars won't be able to charge at a Supercharging station until next year.

BMW was determined to bring Tesla Supercharger access to owners by the end of 2025, after initially promising to deliver it by ""early 2025."" By golly, it finally happened with just days to spare. As of this week, most BMW EVs will finally have access to Tesla's Supercharging network.

Access to Tesla's network was supposed to happen in early 2025, however, BMW announced that it would be delaying the adoption late last year. Better late than never, though, as access is finally going live.

A friendly reminder that all of the BMW EVs on the road today still use CCS ports for DC Fast Charging, meaning that they will have to use an adapter to use a NACS-equipped Tesla charger—at least until the Germans make the switch to a native NACS port.

Nearly every modern EV wearing a roundel (the i4, i5, i7 and iX) support Supercharging access today with an asterisk. Current 2025 model year cars should have no problem,. But older model years and newer model years have an asterisk attached to compatibility. Likewise, not all models support Plug-and-Charge, either.

BMW recommends the Lectron charging adapter, a $174.99 adapter with a ""BMW approved interlock design."" Lectron notes that there are some 2026 models that will need an update (slated to arrive in Spring 2026) before they can use the Supercharging network.

BMW confirmed to InsideEVs that these models—the 2026 BMW i5 and 2026 BMW iX—will not receive Supercharging access until ""Q1 2025"", which ends on March 31. The later access for newer cars seems to have already confused owners in BMW's YouTube video comment section. BMW does note that it will have an official branded charger coming out next year during the second quarter, presumably after this update.

BMW i3 owners also receive no love here. There's no indication that owners of the quirky city car will ever get access to Superchargers, which is not entirely surprising given the age of the car. It's not much of a road tripper either way.

The good news is that adapters are just a temporary solution. BMW has already committed to going NACS-native on future models starting with the 2026 BMW i5 M60.

It's still a big moment for the Bavarian brand. Tesla Supercharging access has been almost a right of passage for manufacturers, and the fact that BMW has finally taken the leap should make owners feel a bit less charging anxiety while traveling this holiday season.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/NGMbjM/s1/bmw-tesla-supercharger-access.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 23:57:44.931271

— Heather Thompson, CEO of ITDP

NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, December 10, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As the United Nations inaugurates its first Decade of Sustainable Transport (2026–2035) this December, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) is urging national and local governments, development banks, and private sector partners to turn the implementation framework into a decade of concrete, strategic action. The coming years represent a historic opportunity to redefine how the world can and will move: away from car-dependent systems centered on harmful fossil fuels towards more electric, efficient, and well-funded public transport networks.

The UN Decade of Sustainable Transport can, and must, be more than a slogan and a campaign. It needs to be an urgent call to align global ambition and partnerships with dedicated resources that ensure more governments, cities, and communities are engaged and equipped to build the clean, efficient, and inclusive mobility systems they deserve. For ITDP, that means turning vision into policy, policy into implementation, and implementation into scale.

The transport sector remains one of the largest and fastest-growing sources of carbon emissions, while also being among the most vulnerable to fluctuating fuel prices. In many countries, transportation costs are driving inflation, constraining public budgets, and limiting access to opportunities for millions of people. Drawing on ITDP's experience working in some of the most populous regions around the world, we know that we need decisive, urgent investments and political commitments to move the needle on the climate, the economy, and the well-being of all urban communities.

Central to ITDP’s call is the urgent need to scale up electric public transport as a cornerstone of every country’s energy security and economic resilience strategies. Transitioning mass public transport, especially bus fleets, to electric vehicles and infrastructure can be transformative for global cities. When supported by clean and reliable energy grids, this shift will dramatically reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, lower costs, and protect individuals and economies from volatile energy markets.

ITDP emphasizes that making such progress over the next decade will require strong coordination across governments and sectors. National Finance and Transport Ministries especially must work together to align their budgets, subsidies, and policies with long-term sustainability targets. Collecting more data and evidence on the economic and health benefits of sustainable transport will also be key to helping finance leaders make informed, strategic decisions. As most public transport systems remain chronically underfunded, developing financing mechanisms and structuring more public-private partnerships to support them are crucial on the road to 2035.

The necessary technical, financial, and policy solutions and evidence already exist to support electric mobility. In fact, electrifying public transport represents a vital new engine for economic and social growth. Better public transport services mean increased access to services, education, and job opportunities for more people, as well as significant cost savings for household budgets. On a broader level, further investments in charging infrastructure, battery production, and electric vehicle manufacturing create jobs, stimulate local industries, and attract international investment. For governments struggling with debt or fuel subsidies, redirecting funds toward sustainable transport can ease fiscal pressure and help meet climate and energy targets.

The benefits for air quality and public health are also significant, and many cities urgently need them. The impacts of tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions from gasoline-burning vehicles are demonstrably linked to higher rates of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in cities. Transport electrification can significantly improve air quality, directly benefiting users and communities living near high-emitting transit hubs. What’s more, a lack of accessible public transport options also has significant implications for road safety, often forcing people to choose more dangerous journeys while increasing their vulnerability to vehicle collisions and air pollution. Reshaping urban transport would not only save economies billions of dollars in avoided healthcare costs but ultimately save numerous lives.

The UN Decade of Sustainable Transport needs to be an urgent call to align global ambition and partnerships with dedicated resources to encourage more governments and cities to build clean, inclusive transport systems for all communities. Again, this means stakeholders must focus on turning vision into tangible policies and resources that can be implemented and scaled globally.

“This UN Decade cannot just be another opportunity for meaningless declarations,” says Heather Thompson, CEO of ITDP. “We have the technology, expertise, and proven solutions to make transport systems better, more reliable, and more equitable. What is missing is the political will and the financial investments to make it happen. Policies, technologies, and resources are there; what is needed is for those in power to act. It is now up to our global institutions and national decision-makers to ensure that we see real action over the next decade.”

Regenerative agriculture is an approach to farming and ranching that goes beyond sustainability, aiming to improve soil, water, and air quality; boost biodiversity; produce nutrient-dense food; and even help mitigate the climate emergency by storing carbon. Its practices include agroforestry, conservation buffers, cover cropping, holistically managed grazing, limiting pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, and no-till farming.

US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced the pilot alongside Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the controversial man behind the MAHA movement. She said that ""we will deliver this support through existing programs our farmers already know and already trust.""

Angela Huffman, president and co-founder of the group Farm Action, a longtime advocate of regenerative farming, welcomed the pilot, noting that ""done right, this investment will help farmers lower their input costs, break free from the export-driven commodity overproduction treadmill, and move toward healthier, more resilient, and more profitable farming systems.""

Stephanie Feldstein, population and sustainability director at the Center for Biological Diversity, was far more critical of the initiative, warning that ""farmers trying to do the right thing for our environment need all the support they can get, but without clear standards, this ill-defined pilot program isn't enough.""

""Regenerative agriculture needs to be more than just buzzwords Big Ag uses to greenwash business as usual,"" said Feldstein. ""While the Trump administration promises money for sustainable practices, it continues to cut conservation staff, support the pesticide industry, roll back environmental laws, and play trade war games that hurt farmers and our food system.""

As Spectrum News reported Wednesday:

The USDA regenerative agriculture pilot program flows from a Make America Healthy Again Commission report released in September that included more than 120 initiatives to address chronic childhood disease. One of the report's key focus areas was to remove harmful chemicals from the food supply.

On Wednesday, Kennedy said the report promised farmers an ""off ramp"" to transition away from chemical fertilizers ""to a model that emphasizes soil health, and with soil health comes nutrient density... and a transition to a much healthier America for our children.""

When the second MAHA report was released in September, some environmental and public health advocates blasted the commission for echoing ""the pesticide industry's talking points,"" while Alexandra Dunn, CEO of the trade group CropLife America, celebrated that ""we were heard"" by the Trump administration.

The administration has also come under fire for constantly serving the fossil fuel industry; installing an ex-lobbyist, Kyle Kunkler, in a key role at the Environmental Protection Agency and nominating another, Douglas Troutman, for an EPA post; embracing herbicides including atrazine and dicamba as well as ""forver chemical"" pesticides; and urging the US Supreme Court to shield Bayer, which bought Monsanto, from lawsuits alleging that glyphosate-based Roundup causes cancer.

As Sarah Starman, senior food and agriculture campaigner at Friends of the Earth, highlighted Wednesday, the Trump administration has also been criticized for cutting billions of dollars in funding previously allocated to promoting regenerative agriculture and firing staff at the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

The pilot, Starman said, ""is a step in the right direction, and we applaud the intent. But it will only be effective if USDA reverses the past year of massive cuts to on-the-ground conservation staff. Regenerative agriculture requires whole-farm, science-based planning, and right now the agency lacks the army of specialists needed to help farmers design and implement those plans.""

""In addition, phasing out harmful agrochemicals—the synthetic pesticides and fertilizers that harm human health and degrade soil health—must be at the center of any regenerative program,"" she stressed. ""The new initiative's incentives for integrated pest management fall far short of what is needed to help farmers get off the pesticide treadmill and spur a transition to a truly regenerative food system.""

""The initiative must be updated to include specific, measurable incentives for deep reductions in agrochemical use if it is to deliver truly healthy, resilient soils and promote human health,"" she added. ""Finally, going forward, all major farm subsidies should carry strong conservation compliance requirements so that every public dollar supporting agriculture also supports soil health, water quality, and climate resilience on every acre.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62304735&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C419%2C0%2C419,N,,2025-12-11 00:57:38.243497

“Is this the new normal?”

I was sitting across from Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, on the main stage of the 2025 DealBook Summit last week when I popped that question.

I wasn’t asking about market volatility or artificial intelligence hype cycles. Rather, I was asking whether we have quietly crossed into an era in which virtually every strategically important decision — on trade, technology, energy, even entertainment — now routes through one address: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and, more precisely, through the instincts of one man. The context was the machinations around the potential takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery. But as the day played out, it was clear we could have been discussing almost any major business decision.

“Andrew, there is no new normal,” Mr. Bessent insisted, batting away the suggestion.

But what clearly unfolded across nearly a dozen conversations with leading business and political leaders is that the United States is operating in a very different environment — a new economic order in which the federal government is no longer just a referee, a regulator, or even a customer. It is now the senior partner, the lead investor and the ultimate arbiter.

In a conversation with Larry Fink of BlackRock and Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, it became clear that the development of the crypto industry will be heavily reliant on the White House’s support. “Tokenization is inevitable” Mr. Fink said, suggesting it is “the next generation for markets” — but only with the permission of the administration.

Mr. Armstrong added that “2025, we’ll look back at this as when crypto went from gray market to a well-lit establishment.” But part of his argument is for Congress to pass a second piece of crypto legislation, the CLARITY Act, which would make it harder for future regulators to crack down on the industry.

The General Motors’ C.E.O., Mary Barra, explained that her company’s strategy has shifted along with White House priorities: As President Trump removed the E.V. tax credits, she is now dialing back on her expectations to sell more electric vehicles. She worked with the Mr. Trump to loosen emissions standards, after working with the Biden Administration to support them. And, of course, tariffs are rewriting the rules of where and how the company manufactures its vehicles.

Silicon Valley has proved particularly adept at adjusting to the Washington-driven business cycle. Palantir has become one of the most valuable companies in the world, in part, because it is one of the most favored companies of the Trump administration. And Alex Karp, Palantir’s co-founder and C.E.O., didn’t bother with the usual corporate diplomacy. He leaned into the new reality with almost religious fervor: “We don’t need belief — we need to be useful,” he said, framing his company not just as a software vendor, but as the digital arm of Western dominance.

One of the few leaders who seemed willing to acknowledge the risks of this new architecture was Dario Amodei, the C.E.O. of Anthropic. While others appeared to be jockeying for favor with the White House, he issued a warning about the prospect of irrational exuberance in tech investments.

“Some players are YOLO-ing,” he said, describing the reckless capital expenditure in A.I. infrastructure without naming a company in particular. (Most in the audience guessed he was referring to OpenAI, his former employer and biggest rival.) “They are pulling the risk dial too far.”

He added about regulation, or lack thereof: “I am concerned that there are some who see this technology as analogous to previous technological revolutions — as being like the internet, as being like telecommunications — where, yes, there are some issues, but the market will figure it out, which I think was maybe a more reasonable view in these previous technological revolutions. I think those who are closest to A.I. don’t feel this way.”

The Trump Effect extends to the geopolitical realm. Both Taiwan President Lai Ching-te and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered answers at times that seemed calibrated to genuflect to the White House. Mr. Lai said Taiwan’s relationship with the United States was “rock solid” despite the administration being noncommittal, at least publicly, about whether it would defend Tawian against an invasion from China.

In my final interviews of the day, I spoke with two political figures with very different perspectives on the current political moment. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, has become perhaps the most outspoken critic of the president and is viewed as a front-runner among Democrats to seek the White House in 2028. While Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk and the new C.E.O. of Turning Point, is a strong supporter of Mr. Trump and his approach.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/11/multimedia/11sp-dealbook-sorkin-SUB/11sp-dealbook-sorkin-SUB-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 21:58:24.051965

“It’s a significant shift in operational requirements, and it represents an opportunity to create a more resilient and cost-effective grid,” Vegas said.
Wind power and natural gas trailed far behind solar and storage additions, adding more than 860 megawatts and 520 megawatts, respectively.
The state added more than three gigawatts of solar power in the third quarter, making it the second-largest quarter for solar additions, according to a joint report by Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Solar and storage capacity are limited during the most critical periods during winter, such as early in the morning before sunrise or in the evening just after sunset.","Battery storage facilities and solar farms powered virtually all capacity growth in Texas’ electric grid throughout 2025, as the home of the nation’s oil and gas industry created almost twice as much new solar power as California.

More than 5,200 megawatts, or approximately 10,500 megawatt hours, of new battery storage made up the largest share of the more than 11,000 megawatts of new capacity, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), operator of Texas’ electric grid. Solar power accounted for the second-largest capacity addition, with more than 4,500 megawatts installed.

Pablo Vegas, ERCOT’s president and CEO, said during a board of directors meeting Tuesday that the new solar power represented “high” growth in intermittent power, while he characterized the new battery storage as “very rapid growth” of short-duration power supply.

“It’s a significant shift in operational requirements, and it represents an opportunity to create a more resilient and cost-effective grid,” Vegas said.

Wind power and natural gas trailed far behind solar and storage additions, adding more than 860 megawatts and 520 megawatts, respectively.

Vegas said the market continues to see low numbers of natural gas connections to the grid, despite the state’s $10 billion loan and grant fund to build more natural gas power plants. But he said there are “significant improvements” in interest among developers exploring natural gas connections to the grid.

Texas is leading the country in new solar capacity. The state added more than three gigawatts of solar power in the third quarter, making it the second-largest quarter for solar additions, according to a joint report by Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). The U.S. solar industry installed 11.7 gigawatts of capacity nationally during the third quarter, a 20 percent increase from the same period last year.

Over the first nine months of 2025, Texas installed 7.4 gigawatts of solar, almost double the capacity of California’s newest additions. This comes despite the Trump Administration’s efforts to roll back renewable energy development in the U.S.

“This record-setting quarter for solar deployment shows that the market is continuing to turn to solar to meet rising demand,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO.

The meaningful additions of solar and battery storage have positioned Texas’ grid to handle summer demand peaks well, with large amounts of solar generating electricity during the day and batteries helping the grid transition into the evening, Vegas said.

But winter continues to represent a higher risk period for ERCOT, Vegas said. Solar and storage capacity are limited during the most critical periods during winter, such as early in the morning before sunrise or in the evening just after sunset. But even then, the chance of rotating outages during the riskiest morning hours is around 1 percent, according to ERCOT reports.

That’s better than last year, when ERCOT predicted a 7 percent chance of rotating blackouts during last winter’s peak hours.

But ensuring the grid stays balanced during the winter months remains a concern, as ERCOT tries to innovate quickly to accommodate the growing variety of energy resources and to accommodate large energy users, like data centers and crypto mines, seeking to connect to the grid.

Vegas said both the state and ERCOT have worked hard since Winter Storm Uri, when blackouts across the state left many Texans without power or heating for days and at least 246 people died, to regain public trust that the state’s grid will hold up in Texas’ extreme weather.

ERCOT’s models show that if Texas experienced a winter storm like it did in February 2021 and demand exceeded record levels, the risk of rotating outages would increase 54 percent.

The forecast accounts for the state’s growth in recent years, projects that if Texas were to be hit by similar weather conditions to the 2021 storm, power demand would exceed 97 gigawatts. That’s far more than the current demand record of 85.5 gigawatts set during a scorching summer heat wave in 2023.

But the likelihood that demand will reach more than 97 gigawatts is less than one percent, according to the report.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2155016308-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 21:00:08.375515

But if we survive the century more or less intact, I think it may be because of another invention, this one about seven decades in the rear-view mirror.

It was an early spring day in 1954 when a trio of researchers, who had been working on power sources for remote telephones, announced the first practical photovoltaic cell, a silicon-based device that managed to convert about six percent of the sunlight that fell on it into usable energy. That was enough for the “Bell Solar Battery” to power a tiny toy Ferris wheel and a small radio transmitter—and in the process to shift the world.

The New York Times that day featured stories about a new US effort to “end the war in Indo-China,” and 28 places to eat along the brand-new New York Thruway, ranging from “snack bars to swanky cafes.” The United States announced that the Iraqi government would receive “military help,” bringing to “29 the number of countries receiving aid under the United States mutual defense assistance program,” and a minister gave a farewell sermon to his downtown congregation, warning that too many Americans felt as if they were “live pawns in a chess game over which they have no control.” Philco advertised its 1954 line of air-conditioners, available at Wanamakers (“mount flush with window sill!”); and the newly crowned Mrs. America, a “tall St. Louis blonde” named Mrs. Madison Jennings who possessed “a 35-inch bust, a 25-inch waist, and 36-inch hips,” insisted in her victory statement that “I’m still a housewife,” and “to prove it headed for the kitchen of the Mrs. America cottage in Daytona Beach to prepare lunch for her husband and son.”

And there, on the bottom of page one (right next to a story about the expansion of the polio vaccination campaign beginning the next day), there was an account of the Bell Labs press conference, under the headline “Vast Power of the Sun is Tapped by Battery Using Sand Ingredient” (New York Times 1954). The new device, the Times reported, was a “simple-looking apparatus made of strips of silicon, a principal ingredient of common sand. It may mark the beginning of a new era, leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind’s most cherished dreams—the harvesting of the almost limitless power of the sun for the uses of civilization.” The sun, the article noted, “pours out daily more than a quadrillion kilowatt hours of energy, greater than the energy contained in all the reserves of coal, oil, natural gas and uranium in the earth’s crust.”

Although the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is, for many, practically synonymous with nuclear risks, the magazine has always been preoccupied by the biggest challenges and opportunities facing humankind—including rapidly expanding energy demands and the search for novel energy solutions. In 1951, the magazine published an impassioned article on the “Future Uses of Solar Energy” by Maria Telkes, a Hungarian-American physicist who worked on the Solar Energy Conversion Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was “an enthusiast of solar energy possibilities,” as her short Bulletin biography described her (Telkes 1951).

In her article, Telkes addressed solar naysayers and skeptics: “Conservative engineers treat this subject with near derision, pointing to the fuel reserves in oil, natural gas, and coal. On the basis of use at the present rate and of use at a progressively greater rate, the estimated fuel reserves of the United States should last for 100 to 1,000 years. A goal definitely more remote than a life-span is of secondary interest to most people, in particular to many engineers, who prefer to engage in the pursuit of tangible results, achievable within a short time. However, technological changes that may occur during a century may be vividly imagined by comparing the technology of 1851 with that of today.”

Anticipating its revolutionary potential, Telkes compared the nascent sector of solar energy to the automobile and airplane—both one-time impossibilities that became transformative technologies. She urged more investment in research and technology development, concluding, “Sunlight will be used as a source of energy sooner or later anyway. Why wait?”

At first, of course, the solar cell was mostly a novelty—nowhere near as important as the nuclear power which was starting to spread across the world on the promise that it would soon be too cheap to meter. It was used for satellites, and eventually for trinkets like calculators and wristwatches—but it wasn’t until the early 1970s that the first house with solar panels was built in the United States, an experimental dwelling on the campus of the University of Delaware. The oil embargoes of that decade caused some to think that solar’s day had come: Jimmy Carter, in his final proposed budget, put aside money for research to ensure that solar would provide 20 percent of America’s energy by the year 2000. But Ronald Reagan was having none of it—he even pulled down the panels Carter had put on top of the White House.

All the while, though, the engineers kept slowly improving the technology. A key moment came late in the century, when the German Green party used its leverage in the country’s parliament to introduce a “feed-in tariff” to pay Germans a generous price for solar power they produced on their rooftops. That (expensive) mandate provided the demand that eventually led to the Chinese learning to mass-produce panels, and from that point on the fall in the cost of power from the sun has been fairly steady. Earlier this decade we passed one of those truly important milestones, as the cost of power from the sun slipped below the cost of burning coal and gas and oil. We now live on a planet where the cheapest way to produce energy is to point a sheet of glass at the sun. And that is truly epochal: It allows us to imagine that humans might, after about a million years, give up the habit of setting things on fire.

Combustion made us who we are, but it also of course is now endangering our hold on civilization. The byproducts of fire—especially carbon dioxide—have kicked off the single biggest change in our planet in the history of our species. So far, at least, it hasn’t been the dramatic mushroom clouds of nuclear explosions that changed our world; it’s been the explosions of billions of pistons in billions of cylinders, the firing of furnaces in homes and factories, the carbon pouring from the smokestacks of power plants in volumes that dwarf the volcanoes that were, for countless eons, the source of most carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We know now the danger of that combustion: the jet stream, the Gulf Stream, and the other large systems of our planet are now in violent flux. By every measure (temperature, humidity, insurance premiums) we are changing the planet even faster than during the five great perturbations of the geological past.

But this broken relationship with the Earth can—irony of ironies—be healed at least in part by a new relationship with our local star. Because, thanks to the solar cell, it is now prepared to offer us (alongside warmth, light, and photosynthesis) all the power we could ever use. The explosive growth of solar power (and wind power, which after all is just another face of the sun’s energy) in the last three years is the first chance to actually scale something that might slow down the rise of the planet’s temperature. It took us from 1954 to 2022 to get the first terawatt of solar power installed on our planet; the second terawatt took us two years; the third is coming online just about now. In May alone, China was installing a gigawatt—the rough equivalent of a coal-fired power plant—every eight hours. And its carbon emissions were finally starting to plateau and even fall. In California, where we’ve clearly reached a tipping point of some kind over the last two years, the state is able to supply more electricity than it uses from renewable sources most days: the world’s fourth-largest economy is using 40 percent less natural gas to generate electricity this year than it did two years ago, which is the kind of number that could actually knock something substantial off the eventual temperature of the planet.

What was once a battle over technological feasibility and cost is now almost entirely one of ideological politics. The Trump administration, guided by its fossil fuel donors, has realized the threat that solar power poses to the profits of the hydrocarbon cartel, and is doing everything within its power to shut it down. That will cause tragic delay, but it will also mean that America is no longer the decisive player in this story: We’re absenting ourselves from global leadership on climate and energy, and ceding that position to China. This may have the paradoxical effect of speeding clean energy adoption in the rest of the world, which after all accounts for more than 85 percent of carbon emissions. China’s trading networks may turn out to be the path on which clean energy spreads: Already, in Asia and Africa, we’re seeing extremely rapid adoption not just of solar panels but of technologies like electric vehicles that make full use of that new flood of power.

Though markets will do much to spread this inexpensive power, there’s no guarantee that this will happen in time—the speed of solar deployment is matched only by the speed of spreading climate damage. But it is definitely the first scalable answer to global warming, the first thing that’s given us a chance of limiting the damage. And so we must push for it with all our might.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has long championed solar power and other renewable energy sources for the sake of humanity and the planet (the Telkes article is just one example of many). In the face of political resistance and potent disinformation, it must continue to match its dire warnings with optimism grounded in facts.

The sweetest irony, of course, is that ultimately this is the twentieth-century’s nuclear revolution made real. Because the biggest reactor in our neck of the woods is the sun, firing prodigious amounts of energy our direction as it endlessly converts hydrogen to helium. The middle of the twentieth century still turns out to be the crucial moment—just not quite in the way we once imagined.",https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/L_Solar-farm-Minnesota.jpg.webp,N,,2025-12-11 03:58:05.820533

ExecutiveSummary

The clean-energy transition won’t be achieved by turbines on hilltops or electric-vehicle (EV) rollouts alone. It will be achieved when clean electricity turns up as lower bills and fewer hassles for people. That depends on how the system evolves, and particularly how it integrates artificial intelligence. This technology could help create a system in which market design, data integration and regulation enable cheaper, clean power to flow easily to homes and businesses – but if these layers continue to operate in siloes, they will remain trapped in inefficiency.

Rethinking markets, modernising regulation and building digital infrastructure that centres the consumer aren’t ribbon-cutting projects, but the government’s success or otherwise in doing so will determine whether the transition feels easy and affordable or clunky and costly.

Public support for climate leadership rests on that difference. Ipsos polling from 2024 shows backing for climate action remains strong, especially for practical, money-saving measures like improving home efficiency.[_] But support is more cautious than it once was, shaped by high bills and cost-of-living pressures, with many people expecting the transition to bring short-term costs. This creates a fragile consent environment in which people will only back green growth when government can show how bills stay predictable, when processes are simple, and when benefits are visible in homes and communities.

AI can do this by making the system work for people. It can turn data into action so households and businesses automatically use the cheapest, cleanest power available, without needing to track energy tariffs or timings themselves.

Today, too often, the opposite happens. Consumers bear the costs of a system that fails to use clean power when it’s available, losing out not only in the form of constraint payments to clean-energy generators when there isn’t enough grid capacity for their power, but also in higher network charges and the wider costs of relying on more expensive generation. This year in Britain, more than £346 million has been spent on wind curtailment because the grid couldn’t absorb excess generation,[_] with costs expected to reach £8 billion by 2030 if nothing changes.[_] Electrification will add further pressure as demand for EVs and heat pumps grows, driving more reinforcement and higher costs unless demand is managed more smartly.

AI can change this equation. Used responsibly – with clear consent, transparency and control[_] – AI can make systems efficient in a way that people can feel. It can forecast supply and demand, balance generation and storage in real time, and coordinate how power is used across homes, fleets and factories so that cheaper renewables are not wasted. It can also automate the back-end processes – verification, settlement and data exchange – that turn those efficiencies into visible savings on bills. The result is not a new layer of technology for people to manage, but a smarter system that quietly lowers costs and improves reliability. Done well, it turns a system that informs people when power is cheaper into one that automatically makes it cheaper.

That change is already starting to take shape. For businesses, startups like Q Energy offer AI-optimised “smart battery” tariffs that guarantee around 10 to 25 per cent savings on electricity bills when paired with on-site storage.[_] For households, similar efforts are emerging via smart EV-charging and flexible tariffs.[_] Together they show what is possible when automation and market design work in sync by using system intelligence to create consumer simplicity.

The government should work across four key pillars to make this future real: Markets, Regulation, Data and Consumers. The first three create the conditions for change; the fourth, delivering for households and businesses, is where people feel the benefits.

The UK already has much of what is needed: strong renewable resources, millions of smart meters, functioning markets, global leadership in AI and a public sector willing to lead. It is focus and follow-through that are missing. To unlock AI’s full potential, government must lean harder on its own delivery system, using energy regulator Ofgem, the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ), the Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT), and the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to drive regulatory and market innovation, not just oversight. That means modernising market design, regulation and data infrastructure so AI can quietly coordinate supply, demand and flexibility in the background, and aligning energy and digital policy so efficiency and flexibility become the default design principle of the system. Done right, the UK can lead globally in showing how AI makes clean energy not just possible but practical – turning climate ambition into lower bills, smoother operations and a transition people want to back.

Chapter 1

HowAICanBringCostsDown

In the UK today, the power system is in transition, but much of its design still assumes a world of central power stations, one-way power flows and predictable demand. That legacy is colliding with something very different: a diffuse, fast-growing network of wind and solar as well as millions of assets at the edge – EVs, heat pumps, home batteries, rooftop PV – and a blurring of supply and demand as households can flex or even sell electricity back to the grid. More variability means far more coordination, with millions of timing-sensitive decisions across networks and markets. Delays in that coordination help drive higher costs. In 2024, the UK curtailed about 8.3 terawatt-hours (TWh) of wind, costing consumers between £390 million and 400 million,[_] and in 2024–25 the system operator spent about £2.7 billion balancing the grid, with constraints taking a large share.[_]

Markets and networks have not yet caught up with that shift. Many rules still reward the volume of energy generated more than when and how power is delivered. Information flows are also episodic rather than continuous, data sit in silos, and tariffs generally don’t reflect real-time cost or carbon – a legacy of the dispatchable era that makes less sense in a renewables-rich system. Flexibility – using demand, storage and distributed generation to adjust when power is consumed or supplied – can absorb cheaper renewables and relieve local stress,[_] but the infrastructure to deploy it quickly and reward it through predictable price signals and simple, auditable settlement between generators, suppliers and consumers is incomplete.

This points to a critical bottleneck: coordination friction, or the drag from fragmented data, inconsistent signals, and slow, patchy verification across markets and networks. This kind of friction blunts the use of flexibility, delays settlement and leaves operators working with partial visibility. The net effect is that flexibility goes under-used, curtailment lingers and savings reach people unevenly.

AI can help change this. It can act as the automation and optimisation layer for decarbonisation – not a replacement for infrastructure, but the intelligence that makes existing assets work harder and smarter, helping turn variability into value. While delivering cheaper electricity requires significant changes, as laid out in our recent paper Cheaper Power 2030, Net Zero 2050, AI has an important role in enabling that delivery. When used as an automation and optimisation tool by operators, suppliers, aggregators and even households (through smart devices and services), AI can:

Forecast and shift: anticipate supply, demand and constraints, then move flexible load and storage into cheaper, greener hours. This reduces curtailment, balancing costs and bill volatility.

Automate and verify: match homes, businesses and fleets to the right energy tariffs and services, and verify shifted kilowatt-hours automatically so credits arrive on time and without friction.

Target investment: use predictive modelling to defer or right-size reinforcement and accelerate connections, bringing clean generation onto the grid faster and reducing the costs passed to consumers.

Reduce soft costs and risk: automate applications (for grid connections, market participation and scheme enrolment among others), performance and compliance reporting, and dispute resolution; build reliable performance evidence so the risk level investors price in is lower, pushing costs down for everyone.

Maintain high reliability: apply predictive maintenance and faster fault detection to head off outages and reduce operational spend.

This marks a shift from using data to surface insights to using data to drive action. Intelligence becomes not just descriptive but operational, turning flexibility into an automatic function of the system.

With AI acting as an enabling coordination layer, a different future is possible. Smart energy tariffs become the default; appliances and cars auto-schedule when they draw power to optimise for price and availability of renewables; personal or business AI “energy agents” quietly optimise when and how power is used, drawing on live prices and grid signals to lower costs automatically; bills fall as use shifts to cheaper, greener hours without constant attention. Behind the scenes on the grid, millions of behind-the-meter devices respond automatically to system signals; models anticipate local stress and trigger demand response instead of relying on more expensive network upgrades or higher-cost power plants; and aggregated flexibility smooths peaks and absorbs oversupply. System costs fall, and with the right policy settings in place, savings can flow through to bills.

For the wider system, the logic also shifts. Markets begin to reward outcomes. Rather than being driven by fixed participation rules and administrative requirements, markets are geared towards how much demand was shifted, how quickly faults were spotted, how efficiently flexibility was used. While these outcomes already matter today, they are often hard to see or reward consistently. With better data and automation, they can become the primary basis for value. And government’s role tilts away from funding hardware on a project-by-project basis and towards building the market and digital conditions for coordination – in other words, trusted data access, standard application programming interfaces (APIs), continuous settlement and clear regulatory pathways for AI-enabled services to scale safely.

Put simply, today’s system is reactive, centralised and costly; an AI-enabled system is proactive, distributed and cost-efficient. In that future, the routine pieces – meters, data pipes, tariffs and regulation – form the backbone that enables clean power to be delivered more reliably and cheaply, sharing the savings fairly. AI doesn’t replace pylons or politics; it makes the system work for people.

Chapter 2

HowGovernmentPolicyMustChange

The government cannot manage this transition with yesterday’s methods. The role of policy is not to pick winners technology by technology, but to create the conditions for AI to stitch them together into services that work for people. If the data, digital infrastructure, regulatory frameworks and market signals are aligned, AI can help make low-carbon living the default. To get there, government must rethink the market, regulatory, data and digital foundations so clean, consumer-facing services can flourish.

Rethinking Markets

If AI is to lower energy bills for households and businesses, electricity markets must be rewired so efficiency can flow through the system. This requires redefining incentives.

Today, savings that could be unlocked in any one layer of the energy system – for example, in distribution – are unable to reach the end consumer because wholesale, balancing and retail markets remain tied to old cost structures. Optimisation of how the system is run should be a design principle of market rules, not an incidental outcome, so reductions in system costs show up in bills. To help make this happen, DESNZ, supported by His Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) and DSIT, should set a joint strategic steer requiring Ofgem and NESO to embed flexibility, digitalisation and AI-enabled coordination.

Recommendation: Set a joint strategic steer across DESNZ, HMT and DSIT directing Ofgem and NESO to embed flexibility, digitalisation and AI-enabled coordination as core design objectives of market reform.

Delivering this shift in market design is crucial to unlocking the full potential of AI in the system. Without markets that reward timing and flexibility, the technologies able to provide it cannot scale. But the value flexibility could deliver if made central to market design is hard to capture because it is still treated as an add-on rather than a core market function. The UK has made progress (for example by piloting local flexibility and publishing a clean-flexibility roadmap[_]) but now needs to scale. NESO should lead work through the Electricity Market Reform programme to align the rules that determine who can take part in flexibility services and how their actions are measured, ensuring that those shifting demand or generation face coherent incentives, prices reflect real-time system value, and actions rewarded in one layer of the energy system are recognised across the rest. Designed this way, AI can help lower the cost of each unit of energy and those savings can reach consumers.

Recommendation: Align market layers so system savings flow through to consumers, with NESO leading work under the Electricity Market Reform programme to integrate flexibility participation and performance rules.

Markets should also reward measurable reductions in system cost, not just availability. When AI shifts demand or generation at the right moment, that value should be recognised automatically and settled transparently. To make that possible the UK needs shorter trading windows, open and interoperable data interfaces and updated market codes such as the Balancing and Settlement Code (BSC) and Retail Energy Code (REC), alongside distribution system operator (DSO) rulebooks. Ofgem’s ongoing work on Market-Wide Half-Hourly Settlement (MHHS) should be extended to ensure interoperability of data and verification standards, giving market participants a common foundation for automation and continuous settlement. These are not technical niceties but the machinery that makes efficiency measurable, tradable and visible on bills.

Recommendation: Extend Market-Wide Half-Hourly Settlement to include shared interoperability and verification standards, ensuring that automation and continuous settlement operate on a common foundation.

Running the power system itself also has to change. Instead of occasional, manual adjustments, the system should operate through a smarter process that uses real-time data to balance the grid continuously at the lowest cost. That means valuing actual performance, publishing simple measures of efficiency and acting on them. One useful metric is skip rates: how often a cheaper balancing action is passed over. Reporting this routinely would expose avoidable costs and build confidence that dispatch is genuinely merit-based.

At the local level, flexibility must be part of normal operations, rather than a patchwork of pilots. DSOs should be able to trigger and verify flexibility automatically when grid conditions demand it, using consistent contracts and measurement standards so participation is interoperable. Early initiatives like Megawatt Dispatch and the Local Constraint Market show what is possible. DESNZ and DSIT should ensure that the digital-spine initiative and related work through the Energy Networks Association converge into a single, interoperable interface for flexibility and constraint data, with Ofgem embedding its use in market and network codes and DSOs responsible for implementation. That would let AI optimise across local and national networks in real time, reduce duplication and curtailment, and lower network costs – benefits that should flow through to bills.

Settlement and retail also need to keep pace with automation. Half-hourly settlement is a milestone, not the endpoint; AI often acts within minutes. Government should complete MHHS as a foundation, then test sub-half-hour or event-based settlement where it clearly reduces costs, such as balancing or constraint management. The aim is not “five minutes everywhere”, but pricing and settlement that are timely enough for automation, accurate enough for investment and simple enough for consumers to see the benefit.

Finally, reform should be tested in the real world. A National AI Energy Sandbox, led by Ofgem, NESO and DESNZ, could trial new rules safely – allowing supervised AI participation with clear guardrails on transparency, auditability and consumer consent – and scale what works. Building on Ofgem’s existing Energy Regulation Sandbox it would allow supervised AI participation across wholesale, balancing, flexibility and retail markets under clear guardrails for transparency, auditability and consumer consent, enabling system-level testing of market design changes and scaling what works.

Recommendation: Establish a National AI Energy Sandbox led by Ofgem, NESO and DESNZ to test new market and regulatory rules safely, under clear guardrails for transparency, auditability and consumer consent.

Taken together, these are not tweaks. Without clear flexibility products, orchestration has nowhere to sell; without faster settlement, revenue certainty is lost; and without interoperable data and aligned incentives, efficiency gains get stuck. Put these foundations in place and the UK can build a system that learns, adapts and lowers bills in real time.

Modernising Regulation

If redesigning markets helps the system learn how to assign value, modernising regulation determines whether AI can actually deliver those savings to people. The shift is from prescriptive, process-based rules to outcomes-based, data-driven oversight. That transition has begun, but at a pace too slow for the change now needed. Regulation must evolve quickly enough to match the technology it governs. Instead of dictating how flexibility or AI services must operate, regulation should focus on whether they deliver the right outcomes. Ofgem should codify the targets of comfort, fairness, reliability and bill savings and publish a consistent measurement-and-verification framework so providers – whether human-run or AI-enabled – can prove results in a standardised, auditable way.[_]

Recommendation: Shift regulation from process-based oversight to outcomes-based assurance, directing Ofgem to judge success by comfort, fairness, reliability and verified savings rather than compliance with static rules.

Recommendation: Codify a single measurement and verification framework so suppliers, aggregators and AI-enabled platforms can prove performance consistently and transparently.

Ofgem is moving in this direction – from household and industrial demand to system-operator services – framing objectives around fairness, flexibility and reliability, and running an innovation sandbox (as mentioned above). Progress, however, remains cautious and fragmented. Much of the rulebook still reflects fixed tariffs and manual operations, which creates friction for AI – sometimes explicitly through conditions written for the UK’s legacy system, and sometimes inadvertently where it is unclear how rules apply to automation at speed and scale.

This is why the sandbox should become a standing, graduated pathway. With clear guardrails (such as explicit consent, comfort floors and overrides, audit trails and routes to redress) pilots can run safely at pace and reveal where rules genuinely need to change. Ofgem could adopt a “progressive licensing” model, where pilots that meet defined outcome tests automatically scale without restarting approvals. The sandbox should become a standing, always-open pathway, allowing projects that meet baseline guardrails – consent, transparency, reliability, data protection – to proceed under time-limited derogations. Used this way, the sandbox becomes a discovery engine for reform, not simply a venue for temporary exceptions. To give this staying power, Ofgem should embed the sandbox as a permanent regulatory function with dedicated resourcing and annual public reporting on learnings adopted into code or licence changes.

Recommendation: Create a standing regulatory sandbox with a progressive licensing pathway, allowing projects that meet consent, transparency and reliability guardrails to scale safely without restarting approvals.

As AI takes on more operational decisions – from forecasting and scheduling to automated dispatch – regulators will need a practical mechanism for certifying and supervising algorithmic participation. Building on Ofgem’s AI regulation laboratory, or “Reg Lab”, certification could focus on transparency, auditability, cyber-security and human oversight, ensuring that automation remains accountable without stifling innovation. DESNZ and DSIT should back the Reg Lab as the central coordination point for testing and assurance, linking it to national work on AI safety and governance so energy remains aligned with wider cross-government standards.

Recommendation: Strengthen Ofgem’s AI Reg Lab as the central coordination point for testing and certifying algorithmic participation, supported by DESNZ and DSIT.

Delivering this requires coordination. Ofgem should codify outcomes, set standards and formalise the pathway from pilot to business as usual. This should include clear timelines, tiered licensing and standing sandboxes for suppliers and aggregators, DSOs and NESO as flexibility buyers, and tech platforms coordinating EVs, heat pumps and storage. Market operators and the organisations that manage the rulebooks governing energy markets and networks should provide AI-ready test environments and be given a mandate to innovate, testing small rule changes under Ofgem oversight. To maintain coherence, DESNZ should convene a cross-regulator energy and data innovation forum bringing together Ofgem, DSIT and the ICO to align policy on AI governance, data standards and consumer protection. This coordination across government is crucial to ensure the regulatory system keeps pace with technology.

Recommendation: Convene an energy and data innovation forum bringing together Ofgem, DESNZ, DSIT and the Information Commissioner’s Office to align policy on AI governance, data standards and consumer protection.

The risk is not only that regulation lags; without deliberate design it can quietly stifle AI-enabled savings through inertia. The fix is to embrace experimentation, regulate based on outcomes, and treat discovery as part of the job, so AI can turn variability into value and make clean power cheaper and easier for people to adopt.

Building Data and Digital Infrastructure

AI can only optimise what it can see and control. To move from insight to action, government must treat data not as a reporting mechanism but as operational infrastructure through which AI can act on real-world conditions. When operational data are slow, patchy or locked away – and when the digital tools that put data to use are treated as short-term experiments – automation stalls.

While the UK already has millions of smart meters and connected devices emitting useful signals, the system still treats data and digital infrastructure as supporting acts rather than core to the system. The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology has estimated that digitalisation-enabled flexibility could cut costs by up to £10 billion a year by 2050[_] – savings that depend on these coordination tools being built, maintained and governed as part of the system’s fabric.

There is broad consensus on what needs to change. As TBI’s Cheaper Power 2030, Net Zero 2050 argues, a smart, open energy-data environment with clear standards, trusted access and timely release is now a prerequisite for cheaper power. The next step is to move from insight to action. Today, data can show where flexibility would help, but the UK needs an AI-ready system that lets data trigger change automatically – shifting load, adjusting prices and coordinating devices the moment clean power is abundant. To make that possible, digital tools can’t sit alongside the system; they must become part of its operational core.

Regulators are beginning to take digital tools and those that allow flexibility more seriously. While RIIO-ED2’s DSO incentives[_] push networks to improve visibility of their systems, coordinate flexibility and use digital tools to manage local constraints, digital infrastructure still isn’t treated as being on par with physical reinforcement. Delivery remains uneven, with variable hosting-capacity maps, fragmented consumer-data access, scarce synthetic datasets for testing, and many coordination platforms or APIs relying on time-limited innovation pots rather than stable, regulated support. DESNZ, supported by DSIT and HMT, should now embed digital delivery into core network-planning and funding frameworks, making investment in data and software eligible under the same business-case rules as physical upgrades.

Becoming AI-ready means creating a data and digital backbone that is planned and funded with the same predictability as the physical grid. That means treating energy data as a first-order system asset that is specified, governed and published to shared standards. Priority operational data sets should use common schemas and identifiers, with NESO, DSOs and suppliers releasing them on consistent timetables and in machine-readable formats so optimisation services can operate seamlessly across regions. DESNZ and DSIT should use Ofgem’s forthcoming data and digitalisation strategy as the vehicle for this – setting mandatory publication standards and aligning incentives across DSOs to deliver them. A single, consent-managed route for household and small- and medium-sized enterprise data would give customers control and confidence, while high-fidelity synthetic data sets – artificial data sets that replicate the patterns of real energy data without revealing any individual customer information – could fill gaps where privacy or commercial limits prevent full release.

Recommendation: Treat energy data as core national infrastructure, embedding mandatory publication standards for priority data sets within Ofgem’s forthcoming data and digitalisation strategy.

Alongside trusted data, the UK needs a stable digital operating layer. Platforms that turn data into action – forecasting hubs, constraint and needs services, verification tools and asset registries – should have clear stewardship, predictable funding and open interfaces. Investment decisions should weigh digital solutions as seriously as physical upgrades, recognising where software can defer, right-size or better target network upgrades. DESNZ and DSIT should formalise and fund a long-term digital-infrastructure plan, building on the digital-spine prototypes, to turn current digital pilots into a nationally scaled backbone with enduring governance and investment. Public procurement can help standardise expectations by requiring interoperable, API-ready systems across the public estate.

Recommendation: Integrate investment in digital coordination tools into network funding frameworks, ensuring that software and data platforms are eligible under the same business-case rules as physical reinforcement.

Recommendation: Develop and fund a long-term digital infrastructure plan to turn pilot initiatives such as the “digital spine” into a nationally scaled, enduring backbone with clear stewardship and accountability.

Finally, an AI-ready power system needs a coordinated environment in which new digital and market tools can be tested safely before they go live. A national framework – linking representative data sets, standard APIs and simulated market and network rules – would let operators, suppliers and innovators trial tariff designs, congestion management and verification methods against realistic system conditions. Ofgem and DSIT could co-sponsor this test environment under the existing innovation sandbox and digital-spine initiatives, giving innovators a stable space to validate tools before market entry. This structure would give regulators confidence to scale what works without fragmenting innovation across one-off pilots.

Recommendation: Create a national test environment for AI-enabled energy systems, linking representative data sets, shared APIs and simulated market and network conditions so new tools can be validated before deployment.

Together, these steps would give the UK a coherent data and digital foundation – trusted, accessible and governed with the same discipline as its physical assets. That is what will allow AI to help cut curtailment and balancing costs, optimise for precise flexibility and bring visible savings to people’s bills.

Putting Households and Businesses at the Centre

The goal of these system reforms is not just efficiency, but visible, reliable savings for households and businesses so that AI can turn cleaner energy into lower bills automatically. However, today, many people who could participate in a cleaner, cheaper system don’t. The path from “interested” to “enrolled and saving” is splintered across grant portals, installer quotes, supplier switches and device set-up; people fall out long before they stand to save. Even when they do enrol, value can be uncertain. For example, because verification and settlement are slow or inconsistent, credits may arrive late or vary month to month. And in a large share of buildings the incentives don’t line up, as the decision-maker isn’t necessarily the bill-payer so viable upgrades can stall. The effect is that participation remains confined to early adopters and flexibility goes under-used.

AI can remove much of this friction – but only if policy clears the bottlenecks that stop it doing so. With consent and the right interfaces, AI can bring every step in the journey into one place, use meter and building data to size and configure solutions accurately, enrol the right tariff automatically, and verify delivered actions against half-hourly data so credits land predictably. This vision could soon include every household or business having a AI “energy agent” that quietly manages power on their behalf. With consent and clear safeguards, that digital assistant could learn a home’s routines, draw on live prices and grid signals, and decide when to charge, heat or store energy to keep costs low. The aim is to move from asking households to act on energy data to building systems that act for them automatically, safely and visibly.

That future is already starting to appear in early pilots and platforms. For example, the Open Energy initiative of Icebreaker One, a non-profit working to expand interoperable data-sharing, has piloted consent-managed frameworks that allow consumers to grant trusted access to their energy data across suppliers and services – an essential step towards a “single front door” for participation. Octopus Energy’s “Zero Bills” homes are bundling solar, batteries, heat pumps, tariffs and finance into one package, with optimisation handled in the background so the household experiences simplicity rather than complexity. And companies like Kaluza are beginning to automate verification by linking household-device data to suppliers, so flexibility actions are scheduled and settled directly on bills, making savings visible without extra admin.

The government’s role is to make these kinds of flows possible and reliable by setting the frameworks and standards that enable choice at scale. DESNZ and Ofgem should jointly design a consumer-participation framework that brings together existing schemes – from energy efficiency and smart tariffs to flexibility services – under a single set of interoperable data and measurement standards. That means establishing a common process for upgrades and enrolment, so accredited providers can manage eligibility, finance, installation and tariff selection end-to-end with consumer permission, not mandating a single route but making participation simple and consistent. Ofgem can underpin this through new licence conditions requiring suppliers and aggregators to support data portability and event-based settlement where relevant.

Recommendation: Design a joint consumer-participation framework led by DESNZ and Ofgem to bring energy-efficiency schemes, smart tariffs and flexibility services under one simple, interoperable set of standards.

It also means agreeing shared, event-based measurement rules and service levels for settlement, so when AI verifies a shifted kilowatt-hour, bill credits land quickly and consistently. Ofgem’s Market-Wide Half-Hourly Settlement reforms provide a starting point; these could evolve into a cross-industry service standard for credit verification and timing. It means making participation portable, so when a customer moves or switches supplier, their enrolment and entitlements follow the meter or registered asset automatically. DESNZ could coordinate this through the Smart Energy Code and retail-market review processes, aligning flexibility participation with existing consumer-protection frameworks.

Recommendation: Set common data and measurement rules so verified savings are credited automatically and on time, using half-hourly data as the baseline for event-based settlement.

And it means building trust and access. This can be done through approaches like licensing intermediaries with clear duties to act in the consumer’s interest, creating standard frameworks for landlord–tenant pass-through and requiring interoperability across devices so accredited services can coordinate them seamlessly. This should be done in partnership with DSIT and the ICO, ensuring that consent, privacy and data governance are handled consistently across energy and digital regulation.

Recommendation: Make participation portable across suppliers and addresses, ensuring that enrolment and entitlements move with the meter or registered asset when customers switch.

Do this, and AI can turn today’s fragmented, manual process into a simple service: configuration done once, optimisation happening quietly in the background, savings credited promptly, and participation that survives supplier and address changes. That is how consumer engagement scales, flexibility deepens and the system’s savings show up where people feel them – making clean energy the convenient, low-cost default.

Conclusion

If the past decade has been about proving that clean technologies work. The next is about making them add up for people – in a way that they can see on their bill. AI is the quiet tool that can do that – seeing across the system, coordinating in real time, and turning variability into value so clean power shows up as lower, steadier bills and fewer hassles. But that can only happen if the government lays the groundwork now with markets that reward timing and flexibility, regulation that assesses based on outcomes at the meter and on the bill, and data and digital infrastructure that are core to the system, rather than pilots. It will take the government leaning on Ofgem and NESO to move faster on flexibility and settlement reform, and joining up energy and digital policy so the rules, data and infrastructure work as one system. Do this and the UK can lead not just on climate ambition or AI research in isolation, but on using AI to deliver climate outcomes that people notice, value and support – at home and at work.",https://media.ffycdn.net/eu/tony-blair-institute-for-global-change/4bVfmAtDEBVrYZHFjR7M.jpg?&width=1200&format=webp,N,,2025-12-10 19:58:47.151163

Accounting for 65 percent of the emissions reductions needed to meet national commitments, the sector presents both substantial transition risks and major investment opportunities. Yet, clean-energy investment in SEA remains insufficient to align with national and global climate goals.

This report provides a technical reference to support financial institutions (FIs) in conducting robust transition assessments of power sector companies in SEA. Moving beyond headline climate targets and capital allocation figures, transition assessments need to integrate operational and contextual realities through three core analytical pillars:

Transition footprint mapping — Identifying a company’s current emissions-intensive activities and assets to locate areas of risk and opportunity

Investment alignment — Evaluating whether the company’s investment pipeline aligns with its stated targets as well as sector and regional pathways

Dependency mapping — Assessing how market dynamics, technology developments, and policy environments influence what is possible and on what timeline

By offering analytical methods, regional data, and regional benchmarks, this guide reduces the burden on FIs to perform this asset-level analysis from scratch. Building on this analysis, FIs can apply similar approaches to individual companies, empowering them to answer questions such as:

What is this company’s current asset base? Does it have coal-powered assets that could conflict with national coal-phaseout objectives? From there, an FI can work with the company on early coal retirement strategies.

What does the company’s project pipeline look like? Is the company on track to meet its climate targets and align with local policy objectives? Assessing alignment-to-policy pathways can inform risk management and determine if the company will be well positioned to take advantage of changing policy environments.

What barriers to transitioning does the company face? Is it dependent on new grid infrastructure (e.g., transmission or storage), favorable policies, or other enabling factors? Identifying mitigating measures for these dependencies can reduce risk and present new investment opportunities.

This report aggregates asset-level data from Global Energy Monitor, an open-source data provider, to address these questions at the regional and national level, but this and other data sources can likewise be used for asset-level analysis of individual companies.

That new law—the Texas Responsible AI Governance Act (TRAIGA)—was signed earlier this year, takes effect next month on January 1, 2026, and creates a comprehensive regulatory framework for the development and deployment of artificial intelligence that imposes meaningful duties on both government agencies and private entities. With TRAIGA’s effective date rapidly approaching, companies must understand their new compliance obligations.

This article primarily focuses on TRAIGA’s effect on companies, starting with a short summary of TRAIGA’s key obligations and regulations and identifying potential actions you might consider taking before January 1. It then provides a more detailed discussion of the same provisions (including TRAIGA’s key obligations, potential penalties for violations, and regulatory sandbox and safe harbor provisions), and then ends with key takeaways and a look toward the future.

Summary of key points to know about TRAIGA

TRAIGA establishes new artificial intelligence (AI) governance rules for companies operating in Texas and preempts any local AI regulations.

TRAIGA’s definition of AI systems is broad—it includes more than just generative AI systems (for example, chatbots)—and therefore will likely apply to a large segment of companies operating in Texas.

Under TRAIGA, government agencies have a duty to disclose to consumers that they will be interacting with an AI system (but they are not required to obtain affirmative consent from the consumer to continue the interaction).

TRAIGA also creates a duty for healthcare providers to disclose to patients that AI will be used in relation to the patient’s service or treatment.

TRAIGA does not create a private cause of action to remedy violations; instead, TRAIGA is enforceable by the Texas Attorney General and can result in civil penalties ranging from US$10,000 to US$200,000 per violation (which can accrue on a continuing, daily basis).

TRAIGA creates a regulatory sandbox for companies to develop and test AI systems without the need to obtain licenses or other regulatory authorization in exchange for sharing information with the State.

And separate from its regulatory sandbox, TRAIGA also provides a liability safe harbor for companies that discover potential TRAIGA violations through their own efforts.

Summary of what you should consider doing before January 1, 2026

Implement and maintain written AI policies that clearly express your company’s intent, purpose and aim for developing or deploying AI systems and guide your company’s use of the same.

Establish an internal review process that seeks internal and external feedback from employees, developers, users and other stakeholders regarding your company’s development and deployment of AI.

Create internal processes that will track relevant information from your AI systems (including inputs and outputs), test your AI systems and perform internal reviews on the same.

Decide whether to participate in TRAIGA’s regulatory sandbox program.

Identify potential TRAIGA violations.

TRAIGA applies broadly

TRAIGA applies to anyone who promotes, advertises or conducts business in Texas, produces a product or service used by Texas residents, or develops or deploys an artificial intelligence system in Texas. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 551.002(1)-(3). A ""deployer"" of AI means a person who deploys an artificial intelligence system for use in Texas, while a “developer"" means a person who develops an artificial intelligence system that is offered, sold, leased, given or otherwise provided in Texas. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.001(1)-(2).

Further, TRAIGA defines AI systems as “any machine-based system that, for any explicit or implicit objective, infers from the inputs the system receives how to generate outputs, including content, decisions, predictions or recommendations, that can influence physical or virtual environments.” Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 551.001(1).

This definition covers more than just the generative AI systems and the related AI companies that dominate the news; it also includes predictive and conversational AI, and likely even systems that wouldn’t necessarily be given the tag of “AI” by technology industry experts or the everyday user. At a practical level, this definition likely includes virtual assistants, grammar check functions, recommendation algorithms, autonomous driving, facial recognition systems, business automation and similar systems.

Given the breadth of this definition, TRAIGA’s requirements are therefore applicable to more than just “AI” companies or companies that use generative AI tools. Additionally, given the proliferation of AI systems—particularly narrow AI that is built for specific tasks—even companies that might not have to ensure compliance with TRAIGA on January 1 may be subject to it in the near future.

TRAIGA requires government agencies to disclose when consumers interact with AI systems

The TRAIGA requirement that will be the most noticeable to consumers is also its most general; if a governmental agency has an artificial intelligence system that is intended to interact with consumers, at all, that governmental agency is required to disclose that fact to the consumer “before or at the time of the interaction,” even if it would be obvious to the consumer that they are interacting with an AI system. See Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.051(b)-(c). Under TRAIGA, this obligation extends to every governmental agency with the few exceptions of hospital districts and institutions of higher education. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.001(1)-(2).

Because TRAIGA’s definition of AI is so broad to begin with, and because AI systems are proliferating, AI use cases are multiplying, and the cost of AI continues to decline, in the near future this duty will likely apply to almost every interaction between a governmental agency and a consumer, and therefore almost every governmental agency will need to draft and implement an AI disclosure for its consumers. These disclosures must be clear, conspicuous, written in plain English and free of “dark patterns” that could undermine user autonomy. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.051(d).

A “dark pattern” is a user interface designed or manipulated with the effect of substantially subverting or impairing user autonomy, decision making or choice, and includes any practice the Federal Trade Commission refers to as a dark pattern. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 541.001(10). Put another way, a dark pattern is a user interface designed to manipulate or mislead a user into doing something they might not otherwise have done.

A governmental agency must draft and implement their AI disclosure in a way that does not do that; the disclosure should not attempt to coax or cajole the consumer into continuing to interact with the AI system after the disclosure when the consumer might otherwise choose not to, and it should not obscure or hide that an interaction with an AI system is about to occur or what the interaction is. However, TRAIGA does not require obtaining the consumer’s consent to interact with the AI system; the governmental agency must simply make a clear, conspicuous disclosure that an interaction is with an AI system.

TRAIGA also requires companies providing healthcare services to make a disclosure to patients

Along with its governmental agency AI disclosure requirement, TRAIGA also imposes a slightly different disclosure requirement on providers of healthcare services (services defined as “related to human health or to the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a human disease or impairment provided by an individual licensed, registered, or certified under applicable state or federal law to provide those services”). While TRAIGA’s current general disclosure requirement is directed at government agencies, this second disclosure requirement will affect private entities that fall under the statute’s definition of providers of healthcare services. Providers meeting that definition are required to disclose to a patient (or their representative) that an AI system is being used “in relation to the healthcare service or treatment.” Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.051(a)-(f).

Relevantly, TRAIGA requires providers to disclose when an AI system “is” actually used in relation to a patient’s treatment. It may therefore be insufficient for a provider to simply make a disclosure to every patient at the beginning of every service that an AI system “may” be used in relation to their future treatment. But while that may impose a higher burden on providers, the statute’s legislative history indicates that it may be sufficient for the provider’s “disclosure to be provided . . . as part of any waivers or forms signed by a patient at the start of the service.” See Tex. B. An., H.B. 149 (2025).

TRAIGA does, however, allow providers additional time to make this disclosure; unlike the governmental agency disclosure, which must be made “before or at the time of interaction,” providers of healthcare services are only required to provide the disclosure on “the date” the treatment is provided, which allows the possibility for the disclosure to be made shortly after treatment is provided as well. Further, TRAIGA also carves out emergencies from this requirement, allowing providers to instead make the disclosure “as soon as reasonably possible” in case of emergency treatment.

As above, with the proliferation of AI—even and especially in backend systems and other systems “used in relation to treatment” (for example, to identify potential abnormalities in imaging)—most, if not all, healthcare providers will eventually need to make a TRAIGA disclosure to patients.

TRAIGA prohibits discrimination by AI systems

TRAIGA also prohibits companies that (1) promote, advertise or conduct business in Texas, (2) serve Texas residents and (3) AI developers/deployers in Texas from intentionally developing or deploying an AI system that unlawfully discriminates against a protected class or infringes on any right guaranteed under the United States Constitution, Texas Constitution, or state or federal law. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code §§ 552.002; 552.056(b).

Crucially, liability under TRAIGA is contingent on whether a party intended to discriminate; evidence of “disparate impact” is not enough to demonstrate such an intent. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.056(c). In other words, if an AI system ends up having a negative effect on a protected group, that fact alone does not constitute a violation of TRAIGA (although it could be used as evidence of a violation).

At first glance, this section may not seem to apply to the average company acting in good faith. But it is still worth considering because TRAIGA puts a continuing burden on companies developing and deploying AI systems. The requirement that a violation of this section be intentional might shield the average company from liability, but TRAIGA’s breadth—and TRAIGA’s instruction that it should be read broadly to accomplish its goal—should give companies pause and invite them to consider implementing policies and procedures to ensure that any discrimination caused by their development or deployment of AI (whether intentional or unintentional) is quickly identified. At the same time, companies should also consider devising a plan to respond to any discovered discrimination so that it can be quickly cured.

Like TRAIGA’s disclosure requirement, this section applies to almost any company developing or deploying AI systems; TRAIGA only recognizes limited exceptions for (1) insurers (subject to applicable statutes regulating unfair discrimination, unfair methods of competition, or unfair or deceptive acts or practices related to the business of insurance) and (2) federally insured financial institutions that comply with applicable banking laws and regulations. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.056(d)-(e).

TRAIGA prohibits AI systems that incite or encourage harm

TRAIGA also prohibits developing or deploying AI systems that manipulate behavior to incite self-harm, harm to others or criminal activity. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.052. As above, the Act is broadly construed to effectuate its purpose of facilitating the responsible development and use of AI systems and protecting individuals. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 551.003. Accordingly, companies should consider that “harm” under this section may be interpreted liberally, particularly since “harm” is a separate sub-section from criminal activity, which could indicate that it includes harm in the civil context. In other words, TRAIGA’s prohibition on “harm” could be quite broad and apply to many different “harmful” outcomes (for example, monetary harm).

Like TRAIGA’s prohibition on discrimination, TRAIGA’s prohibition of inciting or encouraging harm is limited by intentionality. How to define a company’s “aim” for the development or deployment of an AI system is still up for debate, and the manner of the development or deployment will also be subject to scrutiny. Accordingly, companies should protect themselves from potential liability under this section by drafting clear policies and procedures establishing the manner and aim of the development and deployment of their AI systems and creating internal controls that ensure that AI use does not stray from those guidelines.

TRAIGA’s enforcement, opportunity to cure and penalties

TRAIGA does not open the door to private lawsuits; the public may lodge complaints against alleged violators through a forthcoming web portal, but only the Texas Attorney General may enforce TRAIGA. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code §§ 552.101-552.102. However, the lack of a private right of action does not mean litigation risks under TRAIGA should be ignored or downplayed.

A potential violator cannot be immediately sued under TRAIGA; it must first receive a notice of violation from the Texas Attorney General. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.104(a). Upon receiving that notice, the party has 60 days to cure the alleged violations, explain how the violation was cured and identify any changes made to internal policies to prevent further violations. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.104(b). If the party does cure, it may avoid further prosecution and penalties.

If the potential violator fails to cure the alleged violation after the 60 days though, they may be liable for the following civil penalties:

US$10,000-US$12,000 for each TRAIGA violation the court determines to be curable

US$10,000-US$12,000 for each breach of a statement made during the 60-day cure period regarding how the violation was addressed and what changes were implemented to prevent future violations

US$80,000-US$200,000 for each uncurable TRAIGA violation

US$2,000-US$40,000 for each day a TRAIGA violation continues

Companies should be aware of two significant concerns arising from these penalty provisions.

First, given the complexity of AI systems, 60 days may be insufficient time to “cure” a violation of TRAIGA, particularly because a “cure” might mean that the party must substantially modify an AI system, particularly in a situation where the party is not the developer of the system. If this 60-day window is not sufficient time to alter an AI system’s programming or functionality, then a notice of violation will effectively function as a cease and desist order.

Second, TRAIGA currently does not provide clear guidance distinguishing “curable” violations from “uncurable” violations. Because AI systems are code and algorithms, a party may attempt to suggest that, given sufficient resources and time, any part of an AI system could be changed (and thus any problems “cured”), which would render the TRAIGA’s distinction of “uncurable” violations a nullity. But courts are unlikely to read that sub-section as superfluous. At this time, without the benefit of applicable TRAIGA precedent, it is unclear whether the inclusion of “uncurable” violations is an attempt to distinguish between the severity of violations, the time needed to cure or some other factor. What qualifies as an “uncurable” violation will thus be developed by experts, the courts and the resulting common law Companies should watch that space closely as precedent is established and evolves.

TRAIGA establishes a regulatory sandbox opportunity

TRAIGA is not just about duties and penalties; it also provides a potentially valuable opportunity for companies developing or deploying AI systems in the form of a state-approved protected regulatory environment. Companies can participate in that regulatory sandbox for up to 36 months, with limited extensions available for good cause. To be admitted, companies must apply and include the following in their applications:

A detailed description their AI system

Their intended AI use cases

A benefit assessment covering consumer, privacy and public safety implications

A risk mitigation plan

Evidence of compliance with federal AI laws

Participants admitted to the sandbox must then submit quarterly reports detailing system performance metrics, risk mitigation updates and stakeholder feedback.

In exchange for applying and being admitted to the sandbox, participants are permitted to research, test and train AI systems without the need to obtain traditional licenses or regulatory authorizations. However, there are two important caveats related to the sandbox that companies should consider.

First, companies should be aware that annual reports will be issued to the government summarizing the program’s activity, which will include information from and about participants. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 553.103. The reporting agency is required to safeguard participating companies’ intellectual property, trade secrets and other sensitive information when doing so, but companies should be aware that information relating to participants will still be sent to the government in some form. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 553.102(c).

Second, TRAIGA's core duties and prohibitions still apply to participants within the sandbox; participating in the program does not alter a company’s obligations or potential culpability for violations. Companies should therefore carefully weigh the benefits of regulatory flexibility against the administrative burden of applications and quarterly reporting, particularly given the three-year participation limit.

TRAIGA creates a safe harbor for companies that self-identify violations

Finally, TRAIGA also provides a liability safe harbor for companies, including those that do not participate in its sandbox program. That safe harbor protects, among other things, companies that discover and cure potential TRAIGA violations through:

Feedback from developers, deployers or other stakeholders

Testing procedures like red-teaming or adversarial testing

Following state agency guidelines

Internal review processes, provided the company complies with nationally recognized AI risk management frameworks (such as NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework)

If a company discovers a potential violation in one of these ways, they cannot be found liable. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.105(e). Further, a company cannot be found liable if someone else uses the company’s AI system in a way that violates TRAIGA. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.105(e)(1). Additionally, the statute does not currently require the company to cure the violation within a set period to benefit from the safe harbor. TRAIGA’s safe harbor provision therefore incentivizes companies to implement their own protective measures and reporting mechanisms to ensure TRAIGA compliance.

TRAIGA establishes a CID process to investigate potential violations

Companies should also be aware that, if the Texas Attorney General receives a complaint through TRAIGA’s online reporting mechanism, TRAIGA allows the Texas Attorney General to issue (without also requiring it to issue a notice of violation) a civil investigative demand to determine if a violation has occurred. That civil investigative demand can require a company to provide, among other things:

AI system descriptions, including intended use, purpose and training data

Input data details, outputs, performance metrics and known limitations

Post-deployment monitoring and user safeguard measures

A company that develops or deploys AI must therefore be prepared to provide that information. By creating the processes and standards that will ensure that information is readily available—and making sure that information exists and is continually tracked—companies will likely get the added benefit of preventing TRAIGA violations in the first place, therefore reducing the likelihood of receiving a civil investigative demand and, if one is received, reducing the cost of compliance.

Looking ahead: Key takeaways and practical steps for companies

The passage of TRAIGA reflects Texas’s commitment to promoting AI innovation while safeguarding consumer rights. The law rewards proactive compliance efforts, following established risk management frameworks and responding promptly to potential violations. It also heavily penalizes intentional discrimination, manipulation toward harmful activities and evasion of disclosure duties. Since the proposed federal moratorium on state-level AI regulation did not pass, TRAIGA will be the law of the land for companies operating in Texas for the foreseeable future.

TRAIGA’s January 1, 2026 effective date is rapidly approaching. Companies should determine whether TRAIGA applies to their systems and work toward building the necessary policy compliance infrastructure by drafting policies, implementing technical controls and establishing audit trails. Early preparation will be essential for smooth compliance.

Even if TRAIGA does not apply to your company right now, Utah has already implemented an AI governance law, California’s and Colorado’s versions of AI governance laws go into effect in 2026 and other states will likely follow Texas’s lead. At the same time, the usage and expansion of AI systems will only continue. Sooner or later, companies with multi-state or national operations will be subject to AI governance regulations. So even if TRAIGA does not impose obligations on your company on January 1, it might be beneficial to begin implementing policies and procedures that align with its objectives now so as to avoid conflicts and problems in the future.

The proposed project, which Xcel says will improve Colorado's electric grid, has sparked fierce opposition from locals who say there's no benefit to their county.

Dozens of residents packed the Kiowa Fairgrounds Tuesday night to plead their case to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC), asking officials to move the pathway farther east away from people's homes.

""The citizens of rural Elbert County matter,"" one resident told the commission during the hearing.

Xcel is already attempting to acquire private land for the project through eminent domain.

Long-time resident Bill Vogel said he wanted to sell his land for retirement but felt pressured to give in to the utility company.

""We signed not by choice, but I really didn't want to go to court over it,"" Vogel said.

However, other residents like Jessica Heaton are prepared for a lengthy legal battle.

""We've all wracked up a lot of attorneys fees, and other fees associated with it, and that will be our cost to bear and all we did was own property where Xcel wanted to put their lines,"" Heaton said.

The hearing follows Elbert County commissioners' unanimous vote in June to deny the permits Xcel needs to start the project.

The federal government research organization that has been devoted for half a century to renewable energy development has had the word “renewable” stripped from its name.

The Trump administration, which broadly opposes renewable energy projects, changed the name of the Colorado-based National Renewable Energy Laboratory to “National Laboratory of the Rockies.”

The U.S. Department of Energy announced the name change on Monday, effective immediately.

“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” Assistant Secretary of Energy Audrey Robertson said in a statement. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources. Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand. The National Laboratory of the Rockies will play a vital role in those efforts.”

NREL has a prominent presence in Alaska. The agency in 2020 joined into a partnership with the Cold Climate Housing Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The UAF facility is one of four NREL centers; two campuses are in Colorado and there is an office in Washington, D.C.

Jud Virden, the laboratory’s director, said the new name “embraces a broader applied energy mission entrusted to us by the Department of Energy to deliver a more affordable and secure energy future for all,” according to the statement.

However, the name change is a troubling sign to one Alaska organization involved in projects promoting renewable energy and energy affordability.

“Removing ‘Renewable’ and ‘Energy’ from NREL’s name raises concerns. Renewables are key to affordable, secure energy and deliver long-term economic benefits, especially for rural communities,” Bridget Shaughnessy Smith, communications director for the Alaska Public Interest Research Group, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said by email.

“While it’s not yet clear if this name change signals a broad mission shift, any refocus cannot come at the expense of renewable energy or by prioritizing already well-funded fossil fuel industries. Remote microgrid communities in Alaska are working with NREL to innovate toward affordable, reliable energy, and this name change must not disrupt that critical work,” Shaughnessy Smith continued.

NREL’s history started in 1974, when the organization was established as the Solar Energy Research Institute. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush elevated it to national lab status and changed the name to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

The Cold Climate Housing Research Center was established in 1999 with a mission of improving housing and building conditions in Alaska’s extreme climate. The center has focused on renewable energy, along with energy efficiency, structural integrity for buildings on permafrost, indoor air quality and designs that are sustainable in the far north. The center headquarters is the world’s farthest-north building with a platinum rating, the highest possible, bestowed by the U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.

The NREL-Cold Climate Housing Research Center partnership has participated in numerous recent energy and environmental innovations, including the development of non-plastic housing insulation made from a fungi-wood pulp blend.

The NREL name change adds to a list of government agencies and geographic sites changed by the Trump administration this year to align with the president’s agenda.

On the day he was inaugurated for his second term, President Trump issued an executive order directing that the Gulf of Mexico be renamed “Gulf of America” and that Denali, North America’s tallest peak, revert to its previous federal name, Mount McKinley.

The Denali name comes from the traditional name for the Alaska peak used by the Koyukon people, the region’s Indigenous residents. The name, which translates to “the high one,” has been the official state of Alaska name since the 1970s. The McKinley name, for former president and Ohioan William McKinley, has been widely panned in Alaska, and state lawmakers passed a resolution asking for the Denali name to be restored for federal government use.

In September, Trump issued an executive order directing that the U.S Department of Defense be renamed “Department of War.” That resurrected a department name that was dropped in 1947.

The Environmental Protection Agency has fined seven waste and recycling facilities in Massachusetts a combined $170,000 for illegally discharging industrial waste into U.S. waters, including two facilities owned by E.L. Harvey & Sons, Inc. in New Bedford.

The regional waste company’s New Bedford garage and waste transfer station were found to have dumped contaminated stormwater into the city’s waterways over the course of two years between February 2022 and March 2024. E.L. Harvey’s “Zero Waste” facility in Rochester was also cited for contamination over that same period.

E.L. Harvey received a $86,000 fine for violating the Clean Water Act, which requires individuals to seek out a permit before dispensing any industrial byproducts into U.S. waters. The EPA also fined Trojan Recycling, Inc., Nauset Disposal Holdings, Inc., and Arrowhead Environmental Partners, LLC between $38,000 and $20,000 for similar violations at facilities in Brockton, Plymouth, South Yarmouth, and Ayer.

The EPA did not specify how much contaminated water the violating companies had dispensed into Massachusetts waterways. E.L. Harvey did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

This is the second fine the New Bedford waste transfer station has received in three months. In September, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection fined E.L. Harvey $29,980 for failing to prevent a rodent infestation at its Shawmut Avenue waste transfer station. In May, the waste transfer station experienced a fire that released rats into the surrounding neighborhood, including a nearby playground.

During an inspection after the fire, MassDEP found “hundreds” of rats at the waste transfer facility.

The incident occurred as the New Bedford Board of Health considered a proposal for a new waste transfer station, this time proposed by South Coast Renewables, LLC, at the New Bedford Business Park this fall. Residents speaking out against the proposal pointed to the E.L. Harvey facility as a warning sign that companies could not reliably prevent fires or rodent infestations at waste handling facilities.

The Board of Health voted to deny the proposal in mid-September, but South Coast Renewables appealed the decision six weeks later.

Mayor Jon Mitchell thanked MassDEP at the time for holding E.L. Harvey accountable.

New Bedford Public Information Officer Jonathan Darling said in a phone call Wednesday that the city’s wastewater treatment plant reports any unusually high levels of contamination to the federal government to help enforce the Clean Water Act.

""One of the central themes in the stakeholder calls this year was policy uncertainty,"" said Greg Upton, executive director of the center, during a webinar about its Gulf Coast Energy Outlook, which focuses on Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. He cited the Republican Party's ""unprecedented"" repeal of renewable energy tax credits before a previous law's expiration and the Trump administration's unilateral levy of tariffs on international trade partners. ""So, one of the discussions happening is, are we going to start seeing, when new administrations come in, this back and forth?"" Upton said. ""And how does that impact investments that persist a long time?"" However, the region's crude oil and natural gas production are likely to continue growing, while ""decarbonization initiatives, supported by federal subsidies ... offer both opportunities and risks for regional energy manufacturers, especially as global demand for lower-emission products grows,"" the center said in its GCEO report. ""Additionally, electricity's increasing share of energy use and industrial expansion in the Gulf Coast are anticipated to sustain the region's competitive edge,"" the LSU center said. As an example of policy shifts, US Representative Garrett Graves, a Louisiana Republican, said during the webinar, ""We've gone from an Obama administration energy policy to a Trump administration energy policy to a Biden administration energy policy and back to a second Trump administration."" Upton cited the Biden administration's pause of new offshore oil and gas leasing in 2021 and subsequent cancelations of certain lease auctions, but the Trump administration subsequently advanced such plans, and a Gulf Coast oil and gas lease auction is scheduled for Dec. 10. TRUMP ACTIONS 'UNPRECEDENTED' Also, the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act advanced renewable energy tax credits and incentivized offshore wind projects, while the Trump administration froze new and existing federal approvals of offshore wind projects. The Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act canceled certain renewable energy tax credits prematurely, Upton said, which was ""really unprecedented."" LSU's GCEO report assumes current policy persists, but considers how such uncertainty might affect investments, Upton said. Regarding trade issues, Upton said. ""Right now, of course, we're waiting for the Supreme Court decision to see, well, does the executive branch have the authority to put in these tariffs without the action of Congress?"" In the short term, multinational corporations seek ways to avoid tariffs by shifting production toward consumption locations, but in the longer term, the uncertainty can affect where capital is deployed. SLOWER GROWTH FORESEEN So, the latest GCEO foresees growth that is not as optimistic as in previous projections. For example, Gulf Coast gas production in 2022 was forecast to exceed 60 Bcf/d in 2026, which is now projected to be delayed until 2028. After a first-quarter 2025 decline in gross domestic product, growth has resumed at a ""robust"" pace, Upton said, citing the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. ""So, for our outlook, we're going to assume again that the economic outlook is strong,"" he said. ""And so we can see this translating into world final energy consumption."" In contrast with robust global energy demand growth, the US Energy Information Administration has seen flat total energy demand across the nation since the end of the 2008-09 recession, in terms of Btus, but the Gulf Coast's share is trending upward, said Andrew Owens, an LSU CES research fellow. ""Looking at industrial sales, again, over the time frame, 30-plus years, sales are flat, but that doesn't tell the full story,"" Owens said. ""If you look at a depiction of the Gulf Coast share, you see significant growth from around 16 to 17% 15 years ago to closer to 25% today."" Industrial energy sales have grown in states such as Louisiana and Texas with strong natural gas and energy infrastructure, Owens said. DATA CENTERS AT ISSUE ""There is an emerging story, though, and that is data centers,"" Owens said. ""Over the last two years with the emergence of artificial intelligence hyperscale cloud operations, you have seen massive new data centers being proposed and constructed."" Such individual data center projects have grown from 50 to 100 MW to gigawatt-scale efforts, Owens said. In Louisiana, for example, ""the Meta Hyperion data center campus in Richland Parish in the northern part of the state that is being constructed is a 4 million-plus square feet facility and requires more than 2,000 megawatts of power,"" Owens said. ""That's unprecedented. And, at least according to the Louisiana Economic Development Agency, there are some additional hyperscale data center facilities that are being considered for Louisiana."" Graves, the Louisiana House representative, cited projections of ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" invested in ""these data centers located in places that have abundant energy, that have the ability to put electricity in places where you can maintain reliability and price affordability, which means that Louisiana is going to be an attractive source."" The Trump administration made AI ""a high priority looking at this sort of like a cold war between the United States and China and that there will not be a second place,"" Graves said. SHIFTING GENERATION STACK Another factor affecting the Gulf Coast Energy Outlook is the changing generation mix, Owens said, with coal's share falling from more than half of US power supply in the late 20th century to about 15% today. In contrast, carbon-free nuclear, hydro, wind and solar's supply has grown to supply almost 40% of US power. S&P Global Market Intelligence's power plant database shows the combined generation fleet in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas to top 423 GW of nameplate capacity by 2030 from about 390.1 GW in 2024. This would be led by almost 167.6 GW of gas-fired generation, 76.8 GW of wind and 64.4 GW of solar. Based on current retirement plans, the region's coal capacity is expected to fall to about 29.9 GW from more than 33.1 GW. — Markham Watson, markham.watson@spglobal.com-- Edited by Richard Rubin, newsdesk@spglobal.com--Platts Electricity Alert--",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 22:58:03.750647

Texas lawmakers have cut by a third the budget for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality over the last decade, accounting for inflation, the EIP report says.
Most recently, Guerra worked in the EPA Region 6 office overseeing environmental justice efforts, which the Trump administration eliminated this year.
While the EIP report said the state Department of Environmental Quality’s budget had declined 32 percent from 2010-2014, an agency restructuring in 2015 makes quantifying the depth of the reductions difficult.
North Carolina had the largest staffing cuts at environmental agencies from 2010 to 2024, according to the report, though the same caveat related to the 2015 restructuring applies.","Fewer inspections, weaker enforcement and less oversight: Deep cuts to state budgets and at the Environmental Protection Agency are preventing regulators from fully protecting the public from pollution, according to a report released today by the Environmental Integrity Project.

The financial crisis at these agencies is occurring amid the expansion of the fossil fuel, plastics and petrochemical industries, said EIP Executive Director Jen Duggan.

When states have fewer resources, Duggan said, “those protections, those rights that every American has under our environmental laws, are not being realized.”

President Trump’s budget proposal would decimate 2026 spending at the EPA by 55 percent, or $4.2 billion, according to the report. House Republicans are recommending cutting it by a quarter, while the Senate Appropriations Committee voted for a reduction of just 5 percent.

If enacted, these reductions would exacerbate the EPA’s financial plight. Over the last 15 years, the agency’s budget has been slashed by 40 percent, Duggan said, and its workforce by 18 percent. Since Trump began his second term, more than 3,000 EPA workers have retired or have been terminated as part of the administration’s gutting of the agency.

The upshot of these cuts is that states have to pick up the slack, which is central to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s vision for the agency. In March, on the day he announced “the biggest deregulatory action in history,” Zeldin said he intended to “give power back to the states.”

However, the Trump administration has proposed eliminating most EPA grants to the states, undercutting their agencies’ ability to wield that power.

Texas lawmakers have cut by a third the budget for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality over the last decade, accounting for inflation, the EIP report says. The agency has also struggled to retain employees; 30 percent of its workforce has less than two years of experience, and half have less than five years.

Kathryn Guerra worked for nearly four years at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where she helped small businesses and local governments comply with regulations. Most recently, Guerra worked in the EPA Region 6 office overseeing environmental justice efforts, which the Trump administration eliminated this year.

She’s now the TCEQ campaign director for Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group.

The funding cuts to TCEQ described in the report “render the agency largely ineffective,” Guerra said, “and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness.”

According to TCEQ’s biennial report to the Texas legislature, it takes an average of 351 days to process one enforcement case. The agency’s most recent enforcement report shows a backlog of 1,400 enforcement cases, Guerra said.

“Ultimately it means communities don’t get relief from the environmental harms those polluters are causing,” she said.

States with the deepest budget cuts to environmental agencies from 2010–2024, according to the report, are:

Mississippi—71 percent

South Dakota—61 percent

Alabama—49 percent

Texas—33 percent

Montana—32 percent

North Carolina is among the states whose budgets have contracted in the past 15 years. While the EIP report said the state Department of Environmental Quality’s budget had declined 32 percent from 2010-2014, an agency restructuring in 2015 makes quantifying the depth of the reductions difficult.

“These cuts have real impacts on the people of our state,” said Drew Ball, director of Southeast Campaigns for the Natural Resources Defense Council, on a press call about the report.

Ball also serves as a Buncombe County Commissioner in an area wrecked by Hurricane Helene in 2024.

“When a family in eastern North Carolina notices their tap water turning cloudy after a heavy rain, there are fewer staff who can investigate,” he went on. “There are fewer inspectors available to respond when hurricanes send flood waters through low lying areas, mixing industrial pollution, animal waste and storm water, the staff responsible for tracking and responding to those threats are being asked to do far more with far less.”

During the 2008 recession, North Carolina lawmakers cut DEQ’s budget, part of a statewide belt-tightening. However, the Republican-led legislature has not fully restored those reductions in more economically robust times and during an era of increased population growth.

From 2020 to 2024, census data show the state’s population has grown by more than 5 percent. But over the same period, when accounting for inflation, DEQ’s budget decreased.

In 2019, the DEQ budget was $97.4 million, according to state documents, equivalent to $123.7 million today.

The 2023 DEQ budget totalled $108.7 million, or $115.8 million in today’s money. That’s a 6 percent decrease compared with four years earlier.

Some of the agency’s functions rely on permitting fees. In at least one instance, a healthier environment has resulted in unexpected financial consequences. As state and federal regulations have made the air cleaner, Title V facilities, the largest air pollution sources, have decreased their emissions, according to a 2023 DEQ report to the legislature.

This has translated to a drop in “billable tons”—54 percent over a decade—that generate a portion of the agency’s revenue. Yet the state’s 300 Title V facilities still must be inspected and their permits renewed, even as the number of staff has decreased by 19 percent.

In 2024, the legislature increased the permit fee to help close the gap.

North Carolina had the largest staffing cuts at environmental agencies from 2010 to 2024, according to the report, though the same caveat related to the 2015 restructuring applies.

States with the next largest staffing cuts, 2010-2024, are:

Connecticut—26 percent

Arizona—25 percent

Louisiana—24 percent

Missouri and Kansas—20 percent

Adding to the budgetary crisis, it’s also been difficult for North Carolina DEQ to retain or hire employees. At its peak three years ago, the agency had vacancy rates that exceeded 20 percent. DEQ officials said at the time that agency wages, whose boundaries are set by the legislature, can’t compete with the private sector.

“Many families today live with waste in roadside ditches, wells that are too contaminated to drink from and constant fear about what the next storm will carry into their yards,” Ball said. “Yet the very agency responsible for protecting these families is facing a growing burden, with shrinking staff, shrinking budgets and shrinking political support, and now the federal government is proposing the deepest cuts to EPA in 40 years. That’s a recipe for disaster in states like ours.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2232052324.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 18:01:50.832905

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island), Sullivan introduced the original Save Our Seas 2.0 Act in 2020.
“Clean water and a healthy ocean support every family in the country and every sector of the economy,"" said Representative Bonamici.
They deliver cleaner recycling operations, safer drinking water systems, stronger wastewater treatment, and faster trash removal.","The U.S. Senate has passed legislation reauthorizing marine debris cleanup programs originally passed in the 2020 Save Our Seas 2.0 Act for another five years.

“Alaska has more coastline than the Lower 48 states combined, which means our state feels a disproportionate impact of the global marine debris crisis,” U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan said in a release. “These programs, last authorized by our Save Our Seas 2.0 Act, have helped our coastal communities clean up the debris that washes up onto our vast shoreline, provided access to clean drinking water, and supported the health and livelihoods of Alaskans, including our fishermen.

Along with U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island), Sullivan introduced the original Save Our Seas 2.0 Act in 2020. The law instructed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling (SWIFR) initiative, a competitive grant program that provides funding to states, Tribes, and local governments to implement the National Recycling Strategy. Funding can be used to improve recycling infrastructure, reduce contamination in the recycled materials stream, establish or improve markets for recycled commodities, and similar efforts.

SWIFR has provided more than USD 100 million (EUR 87 million) in grants to date, although demand has already far outstripped available funding. According to the EPA, the agency received 452 applications during the first rounds of the grant process. If all of them had been approved, the program would have provided USD 950.3 million (EUR 817.4 million).

“In the first round of grants from one of our Save Our Seas 2.0 programs, every eligible state and territory requested funding,” Whitehouse said in a release. “It is a clear demonstration of the enormous demand from both red states and blue states to address dangerous plastic pollution, and I’m pleased that the Senate has come together to reauthorize these programs. Together, we can protect our clean water and tackle the scourge of plastic waste washing up on shores from coast to coast.”

The Save Our Seas 2.0 Act only authorized the programs for five years, however, necessitating the reauthorization bill.

In addition to SWIFR, the recently passed bill reauthorizes the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Grant Programs and the Trash Free Waters programs, the latter of which provides funding to prevent, remove, and research marine debris.

“Clean water and a healthy ocean support every family in the country and every sector of the economy,"" said Representative Bonamici. ""Extending these successful EPA programs will strengthen the recycling and water systems that stop plastic at its source and support projects that clear debris that damages our shores. These tools work. They deliver cleaner recycling operations, safer drinking water systems, stronger wastewater treatment, and faster trash removal. I'm glad that the Senate advanced our bipartisan bill and look forward to its swift passage in the House to keep families and the environment healthy.”

Though the legislation was passed by the full Senate with unanimous consent, it still needs to be passed by the House and forwarded to U.S. President Donald Trump to be signed into law.

“I want to thank all my Senate colleagues for working to protect our coastal communities, ecosystems and economies, and I urge my House colleagues to join us in renewing these critically important programs before the end of the year,” Sullivan said.",https://s3.divcom.com/www.seafoodsource.com/images/7a1cf471866223af2243ea3cd8b2698b.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 00:57:42.651601

This move aims to deliver a fresh lineup of electric and multi-energy vehicles while strengthening its commercial vehicle backbone. The announcement signals the Detroit automaker’s commitment to Europe but underscores the fierce pressures shaping the industry’s transition.

The partnership with Renault forms a core tactical plank. The companies will jointly develop two Ford-branded electric passenger vehicles using Renault’s Ampere platform, slated for launch in 2028. Ford will control design and driving dynamics to ensure a distinct character. A separate letter of intent explores the joint development of light commercial vehicles, seeking crucial scale in a competitive segment. ""We are leveraging strategic partnerships to ensure competitiveness, but we are obsessing over the product,"" said Jim Baumbick, president of Ford Europe. ""These will be fun-to-drive, fully connected vehicles that stand out from the crowd.""

This industrial cooperation complements the company's drive to defend its leadership in commercial vehicles through the Ford Pro division. The unit is expanding beyond hardware into a full ecosystem of software and services, using data to maximize vehicle uptime for business customers. The strategy leverages existing partnerships, such as the successful Ford Otosan joint venture, to optimize its industrial footprint across the continent.

Alongside these business moves, Ford issued a stark call for European policymakers to recalibrate regulations. The company argues that current CO2 targets outpace actual electric vehicle adoption, creating an unsustainable strain. With EVs holding just 16.1 percent of the market against a 25 percent requirement for 2025, Ford advocates for a more pragmatic timeline and continued hybrid options. President and CEO Jim Farley framed the European challenge broadly: ""As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry. How we compete here - how we innovate, partner, and invest - will write the playbook for the next generation.""

Ford specifically urged aligning targets with market reality, extending consumer incentives, and protecting small businesses dependent on commercial vehicles from what it views as punitive targets.

This move aims to deliver a fresh lineup of electric and multi-energy vehicles while strengthening its commercial vehicle backbone. The announcement signals the Detroit automaker’s commitment to Europe but underscores the fierce pressures shaping the industry’s transition.

The partnership with Renault forms a core tactical plank. The companies will jointly develop two Ford-branded electric passenger vehicles using Renault’s Ampere platform, slated for launch in 2028. Ford will control design and driving dynamics to ensure a distinct character. A separate letter of intent explores the joint development of light commercial vehicles, seeking crucial scale in a competitive segment. ""We are leveraging strategic partnerships to ensure competitiveness, but we are obsessing over the product,"" said Jim Baumbick, president of Ford Europe. ""These will be fun-to-drive, fully connected vehicles that stand out from the crowd.""

This industrial cooperation complements the company's drive to defend its leadership in commercial vehicles through the Ford Pro division. The unit is expanding beyond hardware into a full ecosystem of software and services, using data to maximize vehicle uptime for business customers. The strategy leverages existing partnerships, such as the successful Ford Otosan joint venture, to optimize its industrial footprint across the continent.

Alongside these business moves, Ford issued a stark call for European policymakers to recalibrate regulations. The company argues that current CO2 targets outpace actual electric vehicle adoption, creating an unsustainable strain. With EVs holding just 16.1 percent of the market against a 25 percent requirement for 2025, Ford advocates for a more pragmatic timeline and continued hybrid options. President and CEO Jim Farley framed the European challenge broadly: ""As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry. How we compete here - how we innovate, partner, and invest - will write the playbook for the next generation.""

Ford specifically urged aligning targets with market reality, extending consumer incentives, and protecting small businesses dependent on commercial vehicles from what it views as punitive targets. The automaker’s European path now clearly runs through collaboration, product distinctiveness, and a direct appeal for a more feasible regulatory environment.",https://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2022-Ford-E-Transit-electric-work-van-debut-004.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 02:59:55.882942

Will Congress keep them?,"Evan Saulino, Laura Packard",,,,,https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2025/12/10/aca-tax-credits-helped-more-oregonians-find-coverage-will-congress-keep-them/,"Every Oregon member of Congress must vote to extend these health care tax credits without delay.
If the health care tax credits are terminated, researchers estimate 8,800 Americans will die every year as a result.
If Congress ends the ACA tax credits, more than 35,000 Oregonians will lose all financial assistance for health insurance starting next month.
This will worsen health care access and result in unprecedented price hikes for health care in rural areas.
Extending the ACA tax credits two or three years will save lives, stabilize health care costs, and support local economies.","This year, more than 97% of Oregonians had health insurance. Getting to this level of coverage took years of steady effort and happened because our state treats health coverage as essential for keeping people healthy, for helping families avoid medical debt and for holding down costs for everyone.

For tens of thousands of small business owners, older Oregonians not yet eligible for Medicare, and working families, health insurance has been affordable because of Affordable Care Act tax credits.

This week, Congress will vote on whether to continue these ACA tax credits or let them die, putting years of hard-won progress at risk of unraveling overnight.

If Congress terminates the healthcare tax credits, 4.8 million Americans will lose their coverage immediately, and insurance premiums could more than double for 20 million others. Some families will see their annual costs rise by more than $8,000.

Every Oregon member of Congress must vote to extend these health care tax credits without delay.

The stakes could not be more clear. If the health care tax credits are terminated, researchers estimate 8,800 Americans will die every year as a result. Put another way: this holiday season, Congress will decide if 24 American sons, daughters and parents live or die for each of the 365 days in 2026 and years beyond.

We in medicine who provide health care will be the first to see the results of Congressional action or inaction. Health care needs don’t go away if people don’t have insurance coverage — people just come to us for help when they’re sicker. Then, treatment is more intensive, more expensive and too often too late.

The financial implications are stark as well. If Congress terminates the tax credits, everyone —not just those who get credits now — will pay much more for their health care in the New Year and beyond. Oregon families are already struggling with rising prices for housing, groceries and childcare.

The last thing we can afford is higher health care costs because Congress chose to terminate assistance that has kept health insurance within reach.This year there are more than 139,000 Oregonians in the ACA insurance marketplace including almost 31,000 in rural Oregon.

If Congress ends the ACA tax credits, more than 35,000 Oregonians will lose all financial assistance for health insurance starting next month. This comes on the heels of projections that 210,000 Oregonians will lose health insurance as a result of federal cuts to Medicaid in the budget bill passed in July.

The resulting loss of funding for health care, together with related downstream financial effects, will cause state economic production to fall by about $40.7 billion. State and local tax revenues are projected to drop by $2.5 billion. Oregon is expected to lose about 2,400 jobs, not just in health care but across our economy.

The impacts will be felt all over our state, but rural Oregonians will be hit hardest. In rural communities already facing hospital closures, workforce shortages, and fragile local economies, an influx of uninsured patients will drive up unpaid care costs and push some rural hospitals past the breaking point. This will worsen health care access and result in unprecedented price hikes for health care in rural areas.

Health care providers are not immune from the unaffordability of health insurance. For example, a small clinic in northeast Oregon that provides comprehensive health care services is seeing their 2026 group health insurance premiums increase nearly 30% — up from $1,000 per employee per month to $1,300 per employee per month. This is unsustainable. In an environment where all costs are increasing, reimbursements for providing care are stagnant, and fewer people will be insured, these increases threaten the clinic’s ability to retain staff, maintain services, and fulfill their mission to provide comprehensive care to the community.

Oregonians must hold our Congressional delegation accountable for protecting constituents. Extending the ACA tax credits two or three years will save lives, stabilize health care costs, and support local economies.

In the longer term, health care does need deeper reform. There must be a better, more sustainable way. Oregon should continue to be a laboratory of health policy innovation, and we are hopeful that Oregon’s Universal Health Plan Governance Board can help our state find a better path towards a more effective, stable system for the future.

But today, the decision before Congress is simple: protect families and communities by extending the healthcare tax credits that keep millions insured.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/health-insurance-Getty.jpeg,N,,2025-12-10 18:00:57.283398

Developers of the controversial Guajolote Ranch Subdivision in northwest Bexar County have withdrawn their application for a Public Improvement District and have pivoted to another plan.

Florida-based Lennar Homes withdrew the application for the PID, only to file for a Municipal Utility District, or MUD, for the development, this time through the city of San Antonio.

Randy Neumann is with The Scenic Loop - Helotes Creek Alliance, a group that opposes the project.

“And what it does is allows them to basically become their own little city. They can do bonding, they can levy taxes. They have a fairly broad swath of powers,"" he told TPR.

Neumann says the MUDs in Texas have typically increased taxes for residents.

“But what has happened as a result of these MUDs is that taxes actually go up two to three times what they are in the city because the costs of delivering economies of scale are just not there. “

The city’s planning department will brief city council members Dec. 17 on the MUD petition, during a council work session.

A MUD is established by petition to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).

San Antonio must formally consent through resolution or ordinance before it can be created, as Guajolote Ranch is located in the city’s extraterritorial jurisdiction.

“Typically, if the city says no, the TCEQ will not override that. They do have an alternative. They can go to the state legislature, but that means creating a bill and waiting for the legislature to meet, which won't happen until 2027,"" Neumann said.

Lennar would use the tax dollars to fund a water treatment plant, which would dump as much as one million gallons of treated wastewater into Helotes Creek per day, which opposition groups say could affect the quality of the Edwards Aquifer.

Reuters reported that Tesla is having trouble righting the ship amid a ""sales skid"" as competitors release new, improved EVs, frequently at lower price points than Tesla.
In October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported that Tesla sales declined 48.5% compared to the same month last year, per Reuters.
""The problem for Elon Musk is not just his own cars and the Chinese carmakers.

The Elon Musk-led company is experiencing increased sales pressure in the world's biggest car markets.

What's happening?

Reuters reported that Tesla is having trouble righting the ship amid a ""sales skid"" as competitors release new, improved EVs, frequently at lower price points than Tesla.

Despite Tesla's record-breaking third quarter — fueled by Americans taking advantage of federal EV tax credits before they expired Sept. 30 — Visible Alpha estimated the company's global vehicle deliveries to drop 7% this year after a 1% decline in 2024.

The situation appears to be most dire in Europe, where more than a dozen EV models sell for $30,000 or less. In October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported that Tesla sales declined 48.5% compared to the same month last year, per Reuters. In China, deliveries hit a three-year low, while sales dipped 8.4%. In the U.S., that drop hit 24%.

""The problem for Elon Musk is not just his own cars and the Chinese carmakers. The problem for Elon Musk is also that the Europeans have caught up,"" Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, head of University of Duisburg-Essen think tank CAR, told Reuters.

Why is this important?

While Tesla pioneered the modern EV industry, it can struggle to move its offerings in price-sensitive markets. Ultimately, having a variety of EVs available at more accessible price points is a win for consumers on multiple levels.

Charging an EV is shockingly less expensive than filling up at the gas pump, especially if you power up at home. Qmerit offers free, instant quotes for Level 2 chargers. Over their lifecycles, EVs also account for significantly less air pollution associated with billions in health costs.

However, if Tesla's roller-coaster year stretches into 2026 and beyond, consumer confidence in EVs could take a hit, slowing adoption rates. Musk has gone all in on robotics and artificial intelligence as the future of the company — in fact, as Reuters reported, his $1 trillion pay package doesn't require a major uptick in sales for him to unlock a multibillion-dollar reward.

Yet early returns haven't exactly been inspiring. A history of delayed or broken promises, Robotaxi safety concerns, and a talent exodus — not only at Tesla but also at Musk's xAI — have made many wary of Musk's ability to deliver as planned, though shareholders were confident enough in his leadership to approve his unprecedented pay package.

What's being done about this?

Tesla released more affordable, stripped-down variants of the Model Y and 3 to bolster sales. While powering up at home is cheaper than relying on public charging stations, its Supercharger network remains top-of-the-class, with its vast network helping EV drivers on long road trips.

Reuters also suggested that Tesla ""could benefit as several legacy automakers dial back EV models and factory investments,"" including General Motors, Honda, and Ford.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tesla-cars.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 18:00:45.066884

EPA, the court reviewed a 2023 EPA action that relied on two components: excluding two wildfire-influenced ozone days from Detroit’s design value calculation and redesignating the area to attainment. Judges agreed with EPA’s technical assessment of the June 2022 Canadian wildfire smoke event, finding the agency relied on a clear set of meteorological indicators, satellite data, and chemical signatures that supported a causal link to elevated ozone levels.

The outcome shifted, however, when the court examined Detroit’s redesignation. Because the region was bumped from Marginal to Moderate status after missing its attainment deadline, Michigan was required to implement Moderately classified ozone controls—most notably RACT for VOC and NOₓ sources—before EPA could approve attainment. Those obligations were still outstanding in May 2023. The court concluded that EPA cannot disregard statutory requirements based on the timing of a state’s request and vacated the redesignation.

Infrastructure Consequences With Immediate Reach

Restoring Detroit’s Moderate classification has direct implications for infrastructure planning across the region. Several high-value projects—including highway corridor modernization, logistics hub expansions, EV-supply-chain facilities, and bridge upgrades—depend on conformity analyses tied to ozone status. Remaining in Moderate classification shifts the burden back toward stricter review.

Transportation conformity.

IIJA-funded projects involving added capacity must now demonstrate compliance with SIP budgets that remain constrained without a RACT-backed emissions foundation. This may lengthen modeling timelines or require additional mitigation strategies before approvals move forward.

Industrial development.

Manufacturing expansions—particularly automotive and battery-related operations—must now undergo more detailed permitting for NOₓ and VOC emissions. RACT requirements will influence technology choices, operational strategies, and deployment schedules.

Construction-phase emissions.

Major projects generate temporary emissions from diesel fleets and detour traffic. Under Moderate status, contractors and public agencies will need clearer plans for idle reduction, equipment upgrades, or temporary offsets that prevent exceedances during peak construction seasons.

A National Signal for Ozone Governance

The decision also marks another indication that courts, post-Loper Bright, are reading the Clean Air Act more strictly. EPA’s historical flexibility around redesignations—particularly in regions trying to secure quicker permitting environments—may face more challenges. Other states that used early redesignation requests to soften the impact of bump-ups may now need to revisit whether all statutory control measures were in place.

What This Means as 2026 Approaches

Michigan must now develop and submit a complete RACT SIP and demonstrate implementation before EPA revisits Detroit’s attainment status. Until then, the regulatory environment across the region will remain more demanding for transportation agencies, industrial operators, and developers planning long-term infrastructure investments.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251209-184038-da7-Detroit%20City%20Street%20during%20the%20day.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 22:57:59.775516

New research from consulting company EY shows that car buyers across the globe are changing their minds on wanting EV over combustion. They're also saying that EV buyers are adjusting their purchase plans as governments shift course on electric vehicles.

Half Of Buyers Will Go Combustion In The Next Two Years

According to EY's Mobility Consumer Index, half of car buyers around the world plan to buy a combustion-powered vehicle in the next two years. That's up 13 points from the same study done a year ago, and most of those changes are coming from buyers who had been looking at EVs.

The study found that electric vehicle preference has dropped 10 points to just 14%. Hybrid buyer preference has also fallen, but only slightly. Down five points to 16%.

This sentiment isn't limited to the US, though it was highest there. Consumer intent to buy combustion over electric was up 12 points in the Americas, versus 11 points in Europe and 10 points in the Asia-Pacific region.

Of those shoppers who are still considering electric, more than a third are reconsidering their next purchase. EY said that 36% said that geopolitical developments are behind reconsidering or delaying those EV shopping trips.

Shifting Policy Makes Buyers Wary

The reasons are clear: Massive, recent policy shifts, including the US removing its EV tax incentives as well as the EU's moves to back down on its own mandates. Automakers, too, are reducing the number of options for customers. And having multiple automakers that never delivered on electric promises also likely puts a damper on buyers.

""Consumers are weighing the realities of policy shifts, cost pressures and uneven charging infrastructure. The long-term trend appears to be a shift away from a purely electric (‘E-only’) approach toward a more diversified future for vehicle powertrains, with different vehicle technologies serving different customer needs,"" said EY Global Aerospace, Defense and Mobility Leader Constantin M. Gall.

Buyer concerns over the vehicles themselves haven't gone away either. 29% told EY that range anxiety remains a top concern. 28% are worried about charging infrastructure, and 28% were worried about battery replacement costs.

Range remains a serious factor even as more and more ultra-long-range EVs hit the market. Battery replacement costs stick around on the list of worries, though data continues to show EV packs lasting longer than expected.

The research also found that buyers aren't really buying into autonomous driving capabilities, either. Only 26% of consumers said they felt comfortable with Level 3 or higher. 60% said they were comfortable with lower levels of automation in their own vehicles, with worries about accident risk, tech failure, and high cost all involved.

To little surprise, customers are less happy with dealers than ever before. 41% of buyers said they preferred to complete their purchase in person, down from 61% last year. EV buyers still prefer in-person sales, though, because they want guidance on charging and other tech features.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cropped-engin-akyurt.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-10 17:00:45.863630

The report, titled “State of Decline: Cuts to State Environmental Agencies Compound Damage from the Dismantling of EPA,” examines impacts of the Trump administration’s planned downsizing of the Environmental Protection Agency.

With cuts to the EPA, the federal government plans to shift certain tasks to the state level. But states may not have the capacity to shoulder additional responsibility for environmental oversight, the EIP found in its report.

Almost two thirds of states – 31 – cut jobs at their environmental agencies from 2010 through 2024, leading to the elimination of 3,725 positions, according to the document.

North Carolina is one of the fastest growing states in the country and home to a large and expanding manufacturing and farming sector, Jen Duggan, executive director of the EIP, said.

Despite this, North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality has lost nearly a third of its staff since 2010, the steepest decline of any state in the country at 32%. This translates to 394 eliminated jobs in pollution control and other environmental programs, according to the EIP.

Connecticut (26%), Arizona (25%), and Louisiana (24%) are next on the list in terms of percentage cuts.

“The effectiveness of our nation’s environmental laws relies on a well-resourced EPA working in partnership with capable state agencies,” Duggan said. “When states have the necessary authority, expertise and commitment, the EPA can delegate many responsibilities to them, but this shared system only works when both levels of government are adequately supported.”

The cuts are harmful to the state, said Drew Ball, Southeast campaigns director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Reduced staffing leads to weaker enforcement, which in turn results in dangerous conditions for North Carolinians.

Ball described stories of a family in eastern North Carolina noticing their tap water turning cloudy after a heavy rain and a neighborhood near Wilmington smelling ammonia from a poultry operation. Because of the decrease in staff, state inspectors could not immediately investigate, leading to public health concerns.

“The very agency responsible for protecting these families is facing a growing burden,” Ball said. “That’s a recipe for disaster in states like ours, where the state agency is already stretched thin.”

In addition to federal cuts that have already occurred, there could be more in the upcoming months. Congress is expected to vote on the EPA’s budget for fiscal year 2026 in January.

Earlier this year, the White House said President Donald Trump wants the EPA to cut 65% of its spending, POLITICO previously reported.

The agency put out a statement in response saying the president and EPA administrator Zeldin are working towards creating a more efficient and effective federal government.

“Compared to 2024, the total amount spent year over year at EPA will deliver significant efficiencies to American taxpayers by cutting wasteful grants, reassessing the agency’s real estate footprint, and delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure,” the statement read.

Ball compared the situation to dismantling the fire department when a house is already burning.

“North Carolina cannot keep its people safe if the agencies meant to protect them are left to wither, and the federal government cannot expect states to do more while it simultaneously knocks their legs out from under them,” he said.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mining-along-nolichucky-river_photo-leosharp1765401907.jpg?h=0e628010&itok=VEAfC9NP,N,,2025-12-10 17:01:10.624575

Tear-drinking moths caught on camera sipping moose tears

Author contact: Laurence A. Clarfeld (laurence.clarfeld@uvm.edu)

Researchers in Vermont have captured the first known evidence of a moth or butterfly drinking the tears of a wild moose. While tear-feeding (or “lachryphagy”) on birds, reptiles and livestock has been widely observed in tropical regions, this behavior is extremely rare outside the tropics with only one other known sighting occurring in Arkansas, USA. On June 19, 2024, trails cameras in the Green Mountain National Forest recorded a sequence of images showing moths visiting a bull moose’s eyes. These images came from a larger Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department survey comprising over 247,000 moose photos across New England. Tear-drinking is thought to provide moths and butterflies with essential minerals, especially sodium in temperate regions, while tropical species often seek proteins. Although this behavior offers a unique source of minerals for moths, the authors suggest that it could pose health risks for moose, potentially spreading eye infections or adding to the stress of existing parasites, such as winter ticks.

Masquerade behavior documented in deep-sea squid for the first time

Author contact: Alejandra Mejía-Saenz (alejandra.mejia-saenz@uhi.ac.uk)

Scientists exploring the deep seafloor in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, an area targeted for seabed mining in the central Pacific, have recorded a never-before-seen behavior in a deep-sea squid. At 4,100 meters below the surface, an underwater robot spotted a whiplash squid buried upside-down in the mud, with only its tentacles and siphon exposed. Squid are not known to burrow, and this burying position has never been documented in deep-sea cephalopods (the group that includes squids and octopuses). The researchers postulate that the squid may have been camouflaging itself to look like common seafloor structures such as sponge stalks or worm tubes. This disguise could help it avoid predators or attract small crustaceans that gather around these structures, making it either a defensive tactic or a clever way to hunt. Because deep-sea squids are so rarely seen, this ability to self-disguise may explain why they are often missed and why their diversity may be underestimated. The finding underscores how little we know about abyssal ecosystems and why studying them is essential as mining and climate pressures increase.

Recent peat growth transforming Alaskan ecosystems

Author contact: Alexis R. Stansfield (alexisstans98@gmail.com)

Sphagnum moss has been present on Alaska’s North Slope for thousands of years, but scientists have discovered that the dense peat patches of these mosses that now dot the region’s tundra are younger than expected, with most having formed within the past 150 to 200 years. To investigate their origins, researchers sampled peat cores from nine sites spanning a 300-kilometer stretch of Alaska’s North Slope and radiocarbon-dated the layers to see when Sphagnum moss took hold. They found that the patches of Sphagnum peat largely established after the late 1800s, with the fastest expansion unfolding since the 1960s. These surprisingly recent origins align with a period of regional warming. As temperatures rise and growing seasons lengthen, Sphagnum moss gains a strong ecological advantage, allowing Sphagnum peat patches to expand. The shift is transforming microbial communities and is likely increasing the carbon storage potential of the landscape, and the authors assert that understanding how and why these peat patches form is crucial for predicting future tundra changes and their impact on carbon cycling in the Arctic.

Trade-offs for protected areas and sustainable development goals

Author contact: Aline Gaglia Alves (alinegaglia@gmail.com)

Protected areas (PAs), such as national parks and marine reserves, cover more than 52 million square kilometers worldwide and are intended to protect nature while supporting human well-being. However, their effects on local economies and communities can be mixed, sometimes limiting jobs or restricting access to traditional lands. A global review of 33 studies found that PAs generally benefit environmental, social and economic outcomes, particularly for marine ecosystems, but that they can sometimes conflict with economic growth. For example, some protected areas were linked to reductions in jobs and industrial development, highlighting a mismatch between conservation goals and local economic opportunities. Notably, positive social outcomes often occurred even when economic impacts were negative, emphasizing the need to balance multiple objectives. The effectiveness of PAs depends heavily on local management and community involvement. Most research focuses on environmental outcomes, leaving social and economic effects less understood. Experts recommend more integrated, context-specific studies that include multiple stakeholders to ensure protected areas support sustainable development across all dimensions.

A scalable strategy to regrow coral reefs

Author contact: Christopher Doropoulos (christopher.doropoulos@csiro.au)

Coral reef recovery depends on young corals successfully settling and growing, but on many degraded reefs too few coral larvae are finding spots to attach and thrive—making natural recovery unlikely without help. Efforts to boost coral numbers by releasing larvae over large areas have shown limited success, in part because the larvae are difficult to distribute effectively at scale. A new study on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef introduces a promising solution. Researchers developed a “larval seedbox,” a modular device that slowly releases coral larvae into the surrounding water, allowing natural currents to disperse them. Over the course of the study, five seedboxes delivered 14 million larvae across two hectares of severely bleached reef. Within 48 hours, more than 85% of monitored points around the seedboxes had newly settled corals, at densities up to 56 times higher than background levels and within the range known to support reef recovery. Although long-term outcomes remain to be measured, this method offers a scalable, field-ready approach to accelerating coral reef restoration.

Early classroom lessons shape treatment of Indigenous communities

Author contact: Ryan E. Emanuel (ryan.emanuel@duke.edu)

A new study highlights major educational gaps among environmental professionals regarding Indigenous peoples, and shows how those gaps can impact real-world decisions. The paper reports on discussions with 19 environmental professionals working in North Carolina state agencies. Participants described growing up with stereotypes, fragmented lessons or near-total omissions of Indigenous histories and cultures. Many said their K-12 curriculum treated Native peoples as figures of the distant past, portrayed mainly through trauma or reduced to classroom crafts and caricatures. The authors note that when agency staff lack accurate knowledge, they are less likely to meaningfully engage Tribal nations, especially those without full federal recognition (and that are thereby not always covered by consultation laws). For example, the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline was planned without consultation with any affected North Carolina Tribes despite its disproportionate impacts: approximately 25% of the state's Indigenous population lived along the pipeline route. Addressing these gaps in education is essential for environmental justice, the authors conclude, because decision-making that overlooks Indigenous presence and expertise will continue to reinforce past harms and undermine efforts to protect land, water and culturally significant places.

Then Came the Trump Administration’s Wind Energy Memorandum Designed to Halt Development of Wind Power in the U.S.

On his first day in office, President Trump issued an executive memorandum, “Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects.” 90 Fed. Reg. 8363 (Jan. 20, 2025) (herein the “Wind Memo” or the “Wind Order” or the “Wind Directive”).

Among other things, the Wind Memo directed federal agencies to suspend issuing all new permits, leases, and other authorizations related to the development and operation of both onshore and offshore wind energy projects. In compliance with the Wind Memo, several federal agencies ordered an immediate pause in the issuance of all wind energy authorizations.1

Federal Agencies Acted Immediately to Halt Wind Energy Projects.

Federal agencies wasted no time implementing the Wind Memo to indefinitely halt wind-energy approvals. For example, on January 20, 2025, the same day the Wind Memo was issued, Acting Secretary of the Interior Walter Cruickshank issued an order that suspended delegations of authority to “Department Bureaus and Offices” to “issue any onshore or offshore renewable energy authorization, including but not limited to a lease, amendment to a lease, right of way, amendment to a right of way, contract, or any other agreement required to allow for renewable energy development.”2

Other agencies issued a variety of orders to implement the Wind Memo including:

A representative of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration informed an offshore-wind developer that its Marine Mammal Protection Act incidental-take authorization was subject to the Wind Directive’s pause;

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service temporarily ceasing issuance of permits to wind facilities until further notice;

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) postponed virtual public meetings on its draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Potential Mitigation of Future Development of Wind Lease Areas Offshore California;

The U.S. Department of the Interior and BOEM acted to temporarily halt offshore wind leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. The agencies’ memorandum paused new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for offshore wind projects pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices. As a result, the February virtual public meetings on BOEM’s Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for the proposed Vineyard MidAtlantic Project were cancelled;

On February 5, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers paused permitting for 168 renewable energy projects. The Corps lifted the halt a few days later – but not for wind projects;

On February 28, EPA Region 2 filed a motion requesting that the Environmental Appeals Board remand the Clean Air Act permit for Atlantic Shores Offshore-Wind Project 1 back to the Region for reevaluation. The motion cited the Wind Directive as its basis; and

On April 16, the Interior Secretary issued a memorandum instructing BOEM to order that the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York indefinitely “cease all construction activities.”

Seventeen States and an Industry Alliance Sued to Overturn the Wind Memo.

On May 5, 2025, 17 states3 and the District of Columbia, sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq., challenging the Wind Memo. Later, an industry group, the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, intervened. The complaint asked the court to declare that each of the agencies’ actions to adopt and implement the Wind Memo are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA; that the actions are not in accordance with law or are in excess of statutory right in violation of the APA; and that the actions are otherwise ultra vires.

The plaintiffs sought vacutur of the Wind Memo and asked the court to preliminarily and permanently “enjoin the agencies from implementing or otherwise giving effect to any action that halts or otherwise impedes wind-energy development.”

Failure to Offer Any Explanation, Other than the Wind Memo, for Their Actions.

After concluding that both the state and industry plaintiffs had “standing” to pursue their claims, and that the agencies’ actions were “final’ for purposes of appeal under the APA, the district court readily embraced one of the fundamental challenges by plaintiffs that focused on (1) the failure of the agencies to offer any explanation for the delays and disruptions to wind-energy permitting and development, other than referencing the Wind Memo, and (2) that the agencies failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the “sharp reversal of federal policy or decisions regarding wind-energy development.”

In ruling against the administration, the court stated:

Here, the administrative record consists of only two documents: the Wind Memo and the Interior Department’s written order suspending the issuance of renewable energy authorizations pursuant to the Wind Memo. . . . The Agency Defendants have certified that these two documents constitute the entirety of the “evidence considered, directly or indirectly, by [the Agency] Defendants for the alleged decision” to “temporarily cease issuing new approvals and other authorizations” pursuant to the Wind Memo. . . .

Although the Interior Department’s written order stated that it would expire in sixty days and purported only to bind divisions of the Interior Department, all Agency Defendants acknowledge that they will continue to carry out the Wind Order at least until the completion of the Comprehensive Assessment.

And further:

This scant administrative record makes clear, and the Agency Defendants do not meaningfully dispute, that the Agency Defendants have not “reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the[ir] decision” to implement the Wind Order. . . .

Indeed, the Agency Defendants candidly concede that the sole factor they considered in deciding to stop issuing permits was the President’s direction to do so.States Have Designed Their Energy Policies to Rely on the Development of Wind Energy Projects.

Count V of the plaintiffs’ complaint makes claims for violations of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and alleges that:

Paragraph 432. The Wind Directive and Defendants DOI, Burgum, BOEM, and Cruickshank’s (the DOI defendants) adoption of its categorical and indefinite halt on permitting of wind-energy projects is immediately adversely affecting the States’ legal interest in the “expeditious and orderly development,” 43 U.S.C. § 1332(3), of wind energy on the Outer Continental Shelf;

Paragraph 433. The states have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in wind-energy development and even more in transmission upgrades needed to bring wind-energy resources onto the electricity grid. This investment has spurred the wind-energy industry to spend billions on infrastructure, jobs training programs, and supply-chain development;

Paragraph 434. The states have relied on wind energy as a reliable, affordable source of electricity that helps meet rising demand; and

Paragraph 435. The states also rely on wind energy to help meet their goals, often required by state law, to decarbonize their electricity grids and mitigate greenhouse-gas emissions. These decarbonization efforts are designed to mitigate the impacts of climate change, which are harming and will continue to harm the wellbeing and stability of the States’ communities and economies.

The court agreed and stated:

Agency defendants were obligated, at minimum, to “assess whether there were reliance interests, determine whether they were significant, and weigh any such interests against competing policy concerns.” . . . They did not do so, let alone provide the “more detailed justification” required upon determining that serious reliance interests exist.

. . .

Accordingly, the Court finds that the Wind Order is arbitrary and capricious. The Wind Order therefore must be set aside.

And finally:

For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment . . . are ALLOWED and the agency defendants’ motion for summary judgment . . . is DENIED. The Wind Order is declared unlawful, see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and is VACATED in its entirety.

This decision may not be surprising given opposition from congressional Republicans and industry lobbyists to Direct File. But it is a bewildering choice, particularly given low- and middle-income taxpayers’ concerns around affordability, to end a popular government-provided program that saves people money by allowing them to file their taxes for free. Moreover, there is good reason to be skeptical of the Administration’s plan to rely on commercial tax preparation companies to provide free filing options, as it is likely, and not surprising, that these firms’ for-profit motives will overshadow their commitment to helping taxpayers file for free.

The Direct File program showed that the government can effectively use technology to save tax filers time and money. The Inflation Reduction Act required the IRS to commission an independent study[3] on the feasibility of the government creating a free tax filing program. Based on the study’s results, the IRS developed and rolled out a pilot version in 2024, followed by an expanded version for 2025, with plans to continue expanding in later years.

The IRS rolled out Direct File gradually to ensure a high level of quality at each stage. The 2024 pilot[4] covered taxpayers with a limited range of income sources (income from wages and salaries, Social Security, and less than $1,500 of interest), and while participants could claim the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, the tool did not include those who itemize deductions. The IRS widened the scope of the program in 2025: the number of participating states doubled from 12 to 25, and taxpayers could include other income sources (including additional retirement income, unemployment, and unlimited interest income) and tax credits (such as premium tax credits).

Customer satisfaction with the new program was high, with 94 percent[5] of Direct File users in 2025 describing their experience as “excellent” or “above average.” The Government Accountability Office (GAO) deemed the Direct File pilot a success[6] and recommended that the IRS expand the tool to taxpayers in all states. The Taxpayer Advocate Service declared that Direct File allowed taxpayers to “easily file accurate tax returns fast[7],” and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration recommended[8] continued expansions and improvements.

Despite Direct File’s broad popularity among users, a Trump Treasury Department report[9] offered a contorted rationale for the decision to end the program. The report said that only 15 percent of taxpayers would choose Direct File, but this is misleading because:

48 percent would prefer to keep filing as they do now — but only “if it were free;” and

37 percent would prefer a “return free” option in which the IRS would pre-populate a taxpayer’s return and essentially prepare the return — effectively seeking an expanded version of Direct File with features that only the IRS could provide (and which the Trump Administration would obviously oppose).

Instead of Direct File, the Treasury report signaled plans to reinvigorate the “Free File” program, where commercial tax preparation companies agree to offer limited services to certain tax filers for free. This program was widely criticized for misleading tax filers, so that they ended up paying to file their returns, despite being eligible to file for free. ProPublica exposed these efforts[10] — which included, for example, using special coding language to hide free products from search engine results — and the Federal Trade Commission subsequently took action[11] against Intuit, the parent company of TurboTax, for engaging in deceptive advertising practices.

A recent comment[12] from the CEO of H&R Block to Wall Street analysts highlights the clear problem of relying on profit-seeking businesses to offer their products for free:

“I think what we're getting better and better at is both understanding the cohorts of consumers that are likely free forever versus those predisposed to become paying over time, which requires us to get better and better at reaching them individually.”

In short, for-profit tax prep companies will continue to prioritize profits by driving people toward paid products while downplaying the needs of taxpayers who are likely to remain “free forever” — such as households with low and moderate incomes and those who file relatively simple returns. These are the very people Direct File, or any other taxpayer-focused free filing program, would serve.

Supporters of Direct File, return-free filing, and other taxpayer services that government can and should provide in the 21st century must not give up, and they should play the long game. This means scrutinizing how the industry responds during the upcoming filing season, working with states to continue to develop creative and easy-to-use free filing systems, and encouraging federal policymakers to push for a future return of the Direct File program.",https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_og_image/public/thumbnails/image/istock_000005855720_large.jpg?itok=xXa7ndfO,N,,2025-12-10 17:00:53.703619

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 (the “O3B”) provided significant changes to the renewable energy sector reshaping the policy and investment landscape. However, the changes in the O3B offer an opportunity for those in the geothermal sector to combine early-stage deductions (in line with those available to oil and gas drilling operations) with long-term income streams and tax credit eligibility.

Geothermal power has a combination of the attributes investors appreciate most in clean energy: dispatchable baseload generation, long asset lives, and monetizable tax benefits. By organizing a fund to invest in a geothermal project, sponsors can offer investors exposure to multiple sources of value, including (i) allocations of intangible drilling and development costs (“IDCs”), (ii) clean electricity tax credits under sections 48E (the “ITC”) or 45Y (“PTC”), (iii) ongoing operating income from sales of electricity, and (iv) cash proceeds from the sale (transfer) of credits to third parties.

IDCs: Immediate Deductions for Early-Stage Drilling Expenditures

Generally, capital expenditures, e.g., improvements, new buildings, etc., must be capitalized and are not currently deductible for taxpayers.[1] However, an exception in the Code[2] allows a taxpayer that holds a working or operating interest in a geothermal well to elect to expense IDCs (rather than capitalize them).[3] IDCs generally include non‑salvageable, pre‑production costs such as labor, fuel, repairs, hauling, supplies, and similar items that are “incident to and necessary for the drilling of wells and preparation of wells,” and the election is made by deducting them on the first return in which such costs are incurred.[4]

Choosing Between §48E (ITC) and §45Y (PTC)

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) introduced technology‑neutral credits that apply to geothermal electricity facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024:

§ 48E (ITC) provides a credit equal to an applicable percentage of qualified investment (basis) in a qualified facility. The base rate is 6%, but a 30% rate applies when prevailing wage and apprenticeship (“PWA”) requirements are satisfied or for certain small/early‑construction cases; adders for domestic content and energy community can increase the credit further.

§ 45Y (PTC) provides a per‑kWh credit for electricity produced and sold from a qualified facility. The base credit rate is 0.3¢/kWh, and a 1.5¢/kWh rate applies if PWA requirements are met; the credit is available for 10 years from the placed‑in‑service date.

Note, however, that taxpayers are disallowed from claiming both the investment credit and the production credit for the same facility.[5] Accordingly, sponsors must carefully consider the potential options in order to select the most valuable approach.

Monetizing Credits: Transferability and Direct Pay

For taxable investors, the IRA added a section to the Code that allows an eligible taxpayer (including partnerships) to transfer credits to an unrelated buyer for cash.[6] Consideration must be paid in cash, but the payment is neither (i) taxable income for the seller or (ii) a deductible payment for the purchaser.[7] For partnerships and S corporations, credit sale proceeds are treated as tax‑exempt income for basis purposes and are allocated according to partners’ (or shareholders’) pro rata portion of the underlying credit.[8]

Tax‑exempt and governmental entities may utilize “elective pay” (often referred to as “direct pay”) for credits allowed under sections 45Y and 48E.[9] This election permits the tax-exempt entity to receive a refund equal to the credit amount after a required pre‑filing registration.[10]

Operating Income: Revenue from Power Sales

Unlike intermittent renewables, geothermal plants can deliver a steady baseload output, enabling long‑term power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) and predictable revenues. When paired with tax credit monetization and IDC expensing, these cash flows support competitive, or superior, return profiles in an investment fund.

Example Financial Illustration: ITC vs. PTC for a Geothermal Project

Important: The numbers below are illustrative to compare mechanics and use synthetic assumptions which omit depreciation/basis adjustments (including any ITC basis reduction), financing costs, inflation adjustments to the PTC, and tax‑rate effects from IDC deductions. Actual outcomes depend on specific facts and current guidance.

Assume the Following:

Nameplate capacity: 20 MW (AC); capacity factor: 90% → 157.68 million kWh/year.

Capital expenditure (capex): $120 million; IDCs assumed at 35% of capex (IDC expensing election available to working‑interest holders.)

PPA price: $60/MWh (illustrative).

PWA requirements are met and credits may be transferred at 92¢ per $1 of credit.

Results

Annual electricity: 157,680,000 kWh.

Annual operating revenue (at $60/MWh): $9,460,800.

IDC amount (35%): $42,000,000 (potential year‑one deduction to working‑interest investors via fund allocation).

Scenario A – Claim §48E ITC and Transfer the Credit

ITC face value (30% of $120M): $36,000,000.

Cash from credit sale at 92%: $3,120,000

Scenario B – Claim §45Y PTC and Transfer Annual Credits

PTC face value per year (1.5¢ × 157.68M kWh): $2,365,200.

PTC face value over 10 years: $23,652,000.

Cash from credit sale at 92%: $2,175,984/year ($21,759,840 over 10 years).

Nelson Mullins Observation: In this example, a 30% ITC (transferred) delivers more near‑term cash than the 10‑year stream of PTCs. Projects with lower capex per MWh or higher output may tilt toward the PTC, while capital‑intensive developments often favor the ITC. Adders (domestic content, energy community) can improve either option’s economics.

If you’re a prospective EV customer in Europe, or if you follow developments in the EV sector, this partnership should result in EVs with Ford’s familiar design language and driving character, but at a more affordable price point (due to Renault’s cost-effective EV platform). For everyday drivers who don’t want to spend a fortune on a fancy electric vehicle, these models could offer the practicality and affordability they need.

The Ford-Renault partnerships could also benefit small businesses and fleet operators, as the automakers may work on electric vans. For our readers in the United States, this alliance shows how quickly the EV landscape is changing and how major auto players have to rely on collaborations rather than competition to survive in specific markets. Whether the partnerships pan out the way the automakers plan them to be is something that will unfold in 2028.

As and when the companies successfully co-develop and release the first few vehicles, they could expand the partnership to more models and deepen technology sharing.

“CP2 is a strategically important project to global energy supply and security,” Chris Ashton, Worley CEO, said in a July statement.","Federal regulators have advanced the $28-billion CP2 LNG project in Cameron Parish, La., completing a court-mandated environmental review and authorizing construction of a key compressor station, as developer Venture Global begins work on one of the largest liquefied natural gas export terminals ever built on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's early-December determination approved construction of the Moss Lake Compressor Station—an essential component of the CP Express pipeline—after the agency found that the company had satisfied all outstanding pre-construction conditions.

The authorization caps a year of intensified environmental scrutiny triggered by a federal court ruling that reshaped how the independent commission evaluates cumulative air impacts for major LNG facilities.

Court Forces Deeper Air-Quality Review

CP2’s permitting trajectory shifted after the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., in its Healthy Gulf decision, faulted the commission's cumulative air-quality analysis in separate LNG litigation last year. Although that case did not involve CP2, the ruling prompted it to reopen and expand its environmental review for both the terminal and the 85-mile CP Express pipeline.

FERC issued a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in February and a Final Supplemental EIS in May. The updated analysis incorporates revised stack parameters, refined dispersion modeling and updated background concentrations for nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and other operational emissions across the industrial corridor surrounding the Calcasieu Ship Channel.

The commission also reassessed environmental-justice conditions along the CP Express route through Jasper and Newton counties in Texas.

In a formal comment letter this month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said the supplemental analysis addressed the court’s direction and provided “a more complete cumulative-impact evaluation.”

With those findings in hand, FERC reaffirmed that with required mitigation, the project’s emissions would not produce significant effects, clearing the way for final authorizations under the Natural Gas Act.

Opposition surfaced throughout the federal review. Environmental groups, industrial energy consumers and advocacy organizations filed protests with the US Energy Dept. and comments in FERC’s docket, citing cumulative emissions, environmental justice impacts and broader market concerns.

The two agencies acknowledged those objections, with Energy concluding the exports remain in the public interest and FERC stating that its enhanced modeling resolved the air-quality issues highlighted by the court.

Mobilization Accelerates at Terminal Site

With the supplemental review complete and the Moss Lake authorization issued, Venture Global now holds the approvals needed to advance broader field activity. Earlier Notices to Proceed enabled limited preparatory work, but the company disclosed in June that it had begun full mobilization on the 1,150-acre site following completion of the supplemental review.

Route map shows the CP Express pipeline connecting Texas supply points to Venture Global’s CP2 LNG terminal in Cameron Parish, La., including the authorized Moss Lake Compressor Station.

Construction activity has accelerated. FERC’s biweekly construction compliance report for Nov. 8–21 shows contractors expanding clearing and grading, establishing additional laydown areas, improving site access and installing erosion-control measures across active work zones.

Inspectors documented proper buffering of protected resources and reported no unresolved environmental noncompliance during the period.

Venture Global’s third-quarter construction update adds further detail, reporting more than 3,500 workers on site as of Oct. 31 and noting that soil stabilization is 88% complete, LNG tank construction has reached 28% and engineering is 99.5% finished.

The company also stated that permanent plant equipment is 98% procured and that all CP Express pipeline materials have been delivered. Eight of the project’s 26 modular liquefaction trains are complete, with fabrication continuing off-site.

Venture Global declined ENR’s request for an interview for additional information.

The Moss Lake Compressor Station will connect multiple interstate transmission lines to the terminal. CP Express will supply feed gas consistent with CP2’s planned 28-million-ton-per-year output using a 36-train modular liquefaction system.

Modular EPC Strategy Drives Off-site Progress

Venture Global’s “design one, build many” execution model—developed through its earlier Calcasieu Pass and Plaquemines LNG projects—remains central to CP2’s delivery strategy. Major process modules and equipment packages are already in fabrication yards, enabling parallel advancement of off-site manufacturing and on-site civil work.

Australia-based engineer-contractor Worley received full notice to proceed this summer under a reimbursable EPC contract covering CP2’s initial phase. Two of its U.S. offices are leading engineering and construction planning.

Worley had previously been executing early work under limited-notice authorizations and reported recently increasing its field presence as site development scales up.

“CP2 is a strategically important project to global energy supply and security,” Chris Ashton, Worley CEO, said in a July statement. He added that the project’s modular execution model positions CP2 among the most advanced LNG developments now under construction in the U.S.

Venture Global said in its Q3 corporate results update that it has invested $8.2 billion in CP2 to date, including $1.1 billion in Phase II activities as engineering and procurement progress.

Energy issued its final export authorization for CP2 on Oct. 21 to non-Free Trade Agreement countries, approving shipments of about 1,446 billion cu ft of domestically produced LNG per year through 2050. The agency’s 73-page order (5264-A) relies on updated market modeling and the department’s long-standing use of categorical exclusion B5.7 to satisfy environmental-review obligations under NEPA.

The order responds to extensive protests and comments from environmental organizations, industrial energy consumers and advocacy groups.

DOE concluded that expanded LNG exports remain in the public interest. The approval followed Venture Global’s July financial close for CP2’s initial phase, supported by about $15 billion in commitments.

Local and National Implications Ahead

Venture Global estimates that CP2 will support more than 7,500 construction jobs at peak and employ about 400 permanent workers once operational. The company projects more than $4 billion in local property tax payments over the facility’s lifespan, making it one of the largest anticipated revenue sources for Cameron Parish.

For regulators, CP2 serves as an early indicator of how the federal permitting landscape is shifting. FERC’s updated cumulative-air-impact methodology, developed in response to the appeals court ruling, is expected to influence future LNG and pipeline evaluations.

Two trade agreements recently negotiated by the Trump administration contain novel and coercive provisions with little precedent in US trade policy or the global trade system.

The agreements, concluded with Cambodia and Malaysia in October, demonstrate that bilateral dealmaking has emerged alongside tariffs as a key tool in US efforts to rewrite the rules of global trade and deter economic integration with China.

To date, Southeast Asian countries with ties to both US and Chinese clean energy markets have sought to avoid choosing between Washington and Beijing, but this hedging strategy may have an expiration date as US officials seek greater control over regional trade policy.

In a recent commentary, the authors observed that volatility in US-China trade relations has been a major factor in the structure of cross-border clean energy supply chains, drawing particular attention to the Trump administration’s assertive use of tariffs. Alongside these tariffs, the United States has pursued ad hoc “deals” with a range of trade partners over the past six months that in both form and substance bear little resemblance to conventional free trade agreements (FTAs).

This post analyzes two recent examples involving Cambodia and Malaysia. Titled “Agreements on Reciprocal Trade” (ARTs), the deals include unorthodox and coercive provisions that force difficult tradeoffs on countries with links to both US and Chinese clean energy markets. How these provisions will work in practice remains to be seen, but their goals are clear: to constrain China’s economic footprint in Southeast Asia and delineate mutually exclusive US and Chinese spheres of influence in global trade.

By inserting these terms in the ARTs, the Trump administration is acknowledging the limits of steep US tariffs on Southeast Asian clean energy goods, which have reduced US exposure to Chinese-linked supply chains but not hindered Southeast Asian countries’ economic integration with China. But while the ARTs may contribute to US national security goals, their more immediate impact will be to cause economic fragmentation that risks slowing the clean energy transition in both the United States and Southeast Asia.

Caught in the Middle

Cambodia and Malaysia, like most Southeast Asian countries, have strong ties to both the Chinese and US economies. China and the United States have been, respectively, Malaysia’s first- and third-largest trading partner for over a decade. China is also Cambodia’s largest trading partner, followed closely by the United States; together, the two countries presently account for around half of Cambodia’s foreign trade. Last year, the United States was the second-largest recipient of Malaysian exports (after Singapore), and the largest destination for Cambodian goods by a wide margin.

Cambodia and Malaysia have received billions in Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in the clean energy sector, and are part of two regional trade initiatives that include China: the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area. Cambodia also has a bilateral FTA with China. These economic linkages have enabled both Cambodia and Malaysia to build competitive solar manufacturing industries and decrease reliance on fossil fuels.

As recently as 2023, both Cambodia and Malaysia sold billions in solar products to the United States, but export volumes have contracted sharply after both the Biden and Trump administrations imposed extremely high tariffs. In the last year alone, Cambodian solar exports dropped an astonishing 99.9 percent, from $2.4 billion in 2023 to $6 million in the first nine months of 2025.

Unusual Conditions

Like other governments that have struck trade deals with the Trump administration, Cambodia and Malaysia were brought to the negotiating table by US tariffs. On April 2, the administration announced economy-wide “liberation day” tariffs of 49 percent and 24 percent on Cambodian and Malaysian goods, respectively, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). In July, the White House reduced the “liberation day” tariffs on both countries to 19 percent.

The Cambodia and Malaysia ARTs were concluded in late October during President Trump’s trip to Asia. The ARTs do not alter the economy-wide 19 percent tariff, but rather exempt thousands of individual goods. These exemptions span multiple sectors, but do not include clean energy technologies.

Alongside this tariff relief, the two ARTs contain provisions designed to give Washington extraordinary leverage over Cambodia’s and Malaysia’s trade policies. The Malaysia ART authorizes the United States to terminate the agreement—and by extension rescind the tariff exemptions it provides—if Malaysia “enters into a new bilateral free trade agreement . . . with a country that jeopardizes essential U.S. interests.” The Cambodia ART contains a similar provision for FTAs that pose “a material threat to [US] economic or national security.”

Such “poison pill” clauses are unprecedented in the modern trade system, with one exception: a mechanism in the US-Canada-Mexico Agreement (USMCA) negotiated during the first Trump administration that allows a party to terminate the agreement if another party signs an FTA with a “non-market country.” But the ART poison pills differ from this mechanism in two key respects. First, the USMCA provision applies to all parties, whereas the ARTs restrain Cambodia and Malaysia but not the United States. Second, the USMCA provides a clear and objective definition of “non-market economy,” whereas the ARTs apply vague and subjective standards relating to US “interests” and “security” as criteria for termination.

The poison pills are not the only novel feature of the ARTs. The Malaysia ART stipulates that if the United States imposes a “trade restriction . . . that it considers relevant to protecting the national or economic security of the United States,” Malaysia must adopt a comparable trade restriction upon Washington’s request. In other words, the ART requires Malaysia to delegate aspects of its trade policy to the United States under circumstances defined unilaterally by US officials. The Cambodia ART contains a similar requirement but with a caveat: Cambodia cannot be asked to comply in a way that “infringes” on its “sovereign interests.”

Dueling Visions of Trade Architecture

The practical impacts of the ARTs’ coercive elements remain to be seen. It would be premature to conclude that Cambodia and Malaysia have made a definitive pivot towards economic alignment with the United States. In agreeing to the ARTs, both countries have secured immediate tariff relief in exchange for vague political commitments. Given the reasonable probability that the US Supreme Court will void the “liberation day” tariffs in the coming months, the ARTs may ultimately amount to little more than a gesture of goodwill on the part of Cambodian and Malaysian leaders.

But the ARTs should not be dismissed as paper tigers. Even if the “liberation day” tariffs are struck down, the administration may seek to negotiate comparable arrangements using other tariff authorities. In the meantime, uncertainty surrounding the operation and longevity of the deals means that firms participating in clean energy supply chains in both Cambodia and Malaysia may now face heightened political risk premiums to ensure compliance with US expectations regarding transshipment, supply chain integrity, and investment screenings.

Beyond these practical considerations, the ARTs signal an unraveling of the norm, foundational to the modern global trade system, that bilateral trade deals should be additive rather than exclusionary. Under WTO rules, an arrangement that improves market access between one set of countries cannot require increased market barriers on nonparticipating countries; yet this is precisely what the ARTs require of Cambodia and Malaysia. Furthermore, other than the USMCA, no FTA negotiated since the end of World War II has placed unilateral restraints on parties from pursuing separate market access arrangements.[1] By accepting these provisions, Cambodia and Malaysia have become accomplices in Washington’s campaign to replace the existing rules-based system with a fragmented patchwork of conditional economic alignments—or, in the words of the US National Security Strategy released this month, to “ensure that allied economies do not become subordinate to any competing power.”

The vision of trade embodied in the ARTs stands in sharp contrast to recent statements by Chinese senior officials deploring the proliferation of trade barriers in the global economy and calling for a more open trade system to accelerate the green energy transition by increasing access to Chinese clean energy technologies. This rhetoric has accompanied a renewed push from Beijing to enhance its already broad network of trade and investment partnerships, including a “version 3.0” of the ASEAN-China FTA signed only a few days before President Trump’s visit to Cambodia and Malaysia.

The Cambodia and Malaysia ARTs and the upgraded ASEAN-China FTA present two dueling versions of trade cooperation: one organized around exclusionary reciprocity and the other around open networks that reinforce Chinese export dominance. That Cambodian and Malaysian officials could agree to their respective ARTs and the ASEAN-China FTA in the span of a week is a striking illustration of the reluctance of third countries to choose between the US and Chinese approaches. But the coercive character of the ARTs signal that such hedging may have an expiration date.

Implications for Other Regional Actors

The Trump administration concluded deals with Thailand and Vietnam during the same trip that produced the Cambodia and Malaysia ARTs, and Indonesia announced a provisional trade agreement with the United States back in July. These three deals did not include poison pills like those in the Cambodia and Malaysia ARTs. But this does not necessarily signal that the ARTs are one-offs and other Southeast Asian countries can expect more favorable trade terms with the United States.

The Trump administration has reportedly been strongly pressuring Indonesia to accept a poison pill in the final version of the deal struck this summer, a demand Jakarta has rebuffed on grounds of “economic sovereignty.” There has also been speculation that US officials are seeking to impose coercive terms on Hanoi, which would entail amending the deal agreed to in October.

Given the Trump administration’s longstanding interest to “rebalance” global trade relationships, it is conceivable that this bilateral arm twisting will intensify and expand beyond the Southeast Asian region. Such tactics may result in more deals like the ARTs, but they are just as likely to drive US partners to seek closer economic ties with China, particularly if Beijing succeeds in presenting itself as a reliable and cooperative alternative to US global leadership on economic matters.",https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image_Beyond-Tariffs_-Coercive-US-Trade-Deals-and-Southeast-Asias-Clean-Energy-Future.png,N,,2025-12-10 17:00:29.089736

Protecting internal independence of the NRC staff and the ACRS, along with external transparency, remains critical.
Conclusion NRC independence may be a misnomer.","In a February executive order, the Trump administration asserted that “so-called ‘independent regulatory agencies,’” exercise too much executive power without accountability to the President. According to the EO, these agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Committee (NRC), Federal Communications Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency, among many others, would have to submit all regulatory decisions to the White House prior to their finalization.

A set of nuclear-related executive orders issued in May included one ordering the reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The order sent ripples through Washington that are still being felt, including amongst the nuclear advocacy community that has been working, for years, to reform the NRC and modernize nuclear regulations to enable growth for the industry. What the order means for the NRC, its independence from political offices, and for progress in the fight for regulatory modernization is still up in the air.

In June, the White House abruptly dismissed Commissioner Christopher Hanson, a Democratic appointee whose term ran through 2029. The dismissal was followed by a controversial statement attributed to the DOGE lead at the NRC that he expected the agency to “rubberstamp” reactor designs already approved by the Department of Energy. Members of Congress and former NRC Commissioners and staff reacted to the statement, warning that it risks politicizing safety oversight.

Together, these developments have sparked a renewed national debate over the independence of the NRC and what it means for a technically-oriented mission-driven regulator whose credibility underpins public trust and international confidence in nuclear power.

However, most partisans in this debate don’t understand the nature of the NRC’s independence, or its statutory history.

It is true that the NRC must remain a regulator that has the authority and capacity to take necessary actions to achieve its statutory mandate, and is independent of, and not influenced by, the nuclear industry. But, when it comes to the NRC’s independence from other parts of the federal government—a factor in the NRC’s capacity to fulfill its statutory obligation—the reality is more complex. In short, the NRC has never been fully independent from other parts of government; instead, it is built on layers of independence and oversight.

The Independence Needed to Fulfill Statutory Objectives

The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to have authority over atomic material and technologies, including energy, industrial, and medical uses, and for research and development. A Commission structure was used to ensure a range of input from members with technical expertise could make judgements on licensing decisions and be independent of industry influence.

The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (ERA) abolished the AEC and established the five-member Nuclear Regulatory Commission to take over licensing and regulatory authority from the AEC. The NRC was created to “promote well-balanced and closely supervised regulation of the burgeoning nuclear power industry” separate from the development and promotion activities of the newly created Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). The final version of the ERA calls the NRC an “independent regulatory commission” and the ERDA an “independent executive agency.” The ERDA was later rolled into the Department of Energy.

Congress, through the AEA, gives authority to the Commission to set policy and regulations directly. Specifically, the Commission has authority to determine what requirements it deems are appropriate and necessary to obtain an operating license, and to take actions to achieve its statutory mandate. Critically, only the Commissioners can issue reactor licenses, not the NRC staff, nor the President, or any other political or bureaucratic leader. And, if a reactor meets the stated requirements, the Commission does not have the authority to withhold a license.

The mission of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is to provide adequate protection for the health and safety of the public, common defense and security, and protect the environment, while maximizing the contribution of nuclear technology to the general welfare. This provides the policy priorities for the NRC; it must always enable nuclear technologies, while also requiring the rigor and protections necessary.

In the case brief for Siegel v. Atomic Energy Commission (1968), Judge Carl McGowan of the U.S. Court of Appeals identified the commission’s independence as key to the NRC’s success, writing that Congress enacted “a regulatory scheme which is virtually unique in the degree to which broad responsibility is reposed in the administering agency, free of close prescription in its charter as to how it shall proceed in achieving the statutory objectives.”

That level of independence is very important to avoid incentives or pressures to approve a technology or application that does not meet the mission of the agency. Those incentives could exist in a case where there was pressure to complete a project, but safety evaluations either were not completed or determined that the project should not be completed. That is the independence that is critical to maintain to avoid outside parties—whether a presidential administration, industry groups, or congressional offices—from undercutting the work of the NRC to benefit society and enable nuclear technology.

But the NRC Has Never Been Completely Independent

Presidential administrations and Congress have always had political influence over the Commission. Because commissioners are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has never been fully independent from politics. Congress understood this when the Commission was originally created and required that no more than three commissioners could be from any one political party, in order to “maintain political balance” while also setting staggered five-year terms to create regulatory stability.

Appointments have been used to implement higher-level political goals in the past. Commissioners have been appointed with the intent to make regulations stricter, scale them back, provide balance, stop progress on spent fuel storage at Yucca Mountain, or expand regulations in response to the incident at Fukushima Daiichi. While serving their term, some commissioners stay at arms-length from elected officials, others stay very engaged with Congress and the Administration.

The Commission also needs to have budgets approved by the President through the Office of Management and Budget and, more recently, rules approved by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The President also has the authority in the AEA to remove Commissioners for cause, defined as inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. This is an oversight backstop to prevent Commissioners who are not doing their job from staying in that role. But, the backstop has been rarely used, even when the Commission has not been efficient in fulfilling its duties.

Since Congress passed the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act in 2019, mandating regulatory reform, the Commission has taken an average of 270 days to vote on policies and rulemakings submitted by staff, despite internal procedures that set the standard of completing votes in 18-60 days. In that span, only 20% of votes were completed on time. Despite this, no Administration sought to remove Commissioners that were neglecting their duties.

Separately, in 2011 four Commissioners sent an unprecedented letter to President Obama’s Chief of Staff, raising significant concerns about former Chairman Jaczko’s abuse and intimidation of NRC staff and the ACRS into following orders. Congressional Democrats maintained support for him, complimenting him as “the best chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in its history,” Congressional Republicans issued a report that suggested Jaczko withheld information from other Commissioners and suggested that votes could be seen as a lack of support for the Obama administration—a parallel to current concerns. Instead of removing him as the Chair or unseating him as a Commissioner, President Obama’s Chief of Staff directed the Commission to seek third-party help, and quietly pressured Jaczko to resign on his own accord, letting the problem linger for seven more months.

However, a change of administration and political dynamics could impact the stability of the Commission. The NRC operates significantly less effectively when there are only three commissioners. An example is the waiting time for a vote increased during mid-2016 to mid-2018 when only three commissioners were on the commission. This is in part because a vote from at least three commissioners is required to act, and one commissioner could withhold their vote (i.e., a “pocket veto”) to avoid action. Pocket vetoes are often used by a single commissioner from a party to block progress for political reasons, and they are becoming more common. A President not nominating replacement Commissioners to avoid a pocket veto situation, or the Senate delaying or blocking nominations to perpetuate gridlock at the NRC is also a political decision.

Congress also has influence through oversight activities. In the past, members of Congress have guided the composition of the Commission and issues such as spent fuel management. Congress can, and has, passed legislation to direct actions at the NRC, or rescind policies of the Commission. For example, Congress forced the NRC to revoke its policy regarding how to regulate risks that are considered to be below regulatory concern.

Concerns of Presidential influence over the NRC are no more or less concerning than Congressional pressure on the Commission. But, this has always been the case and is by design. There need to be checks and balances, and these checks exist at a higher level than the technical work of implementing the NRC’s mission that ensures safety and environmental protection.

Independence and Backstops Within the NRC

While much of the debate over NRC independence has been in relation to the commission’s independence from Presidential administrations and Congress, there are multiple layers of independence within the agency itself that remain crucial for the NRC to fulfill its statutory obligations. Effectively, the NRC operates through three relatively independent structures: the Commission itself, the NRC staff, and the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS), which is a safeguard that checks the technical detail of all licensing decisions.

The NRC staff conducts the safety and environmental evaluations largely independent of the Commission with technical detail and rigor. Depending on the licensing activity, evaluations may be published for public comment or be open to intervention by third parties. Once complete, reports that detail whether the application satisfies the letter of the regulations are sent to the Commission along with the staff’s recommendation.

The Commission then independently reviews the reports, staff recommendations, input from the ACRS, and public comments. The Commission is required to hold a hearing on the licensing actions with the staff and applicant, and ultimately, the Commission has to decide whether to issue the license.

The Commissioners can still put pressure on the staff by overriding the staff recommendations, changing agency policies, or avoiding votes on certain matters for extended periods of time if they do not agree with the staff or options provided by the staff. For example, a 2017 proposed rule on cyber security was ignored for years and finally withdrawn in 2025. The final emergency preparedness rule for advanced reactors waited for the Commission to vote for more than 18 months, and only moved forward with urging from external groups.

There are further protections to ensure staff can make independent recommendations. The AEA clearly defines protections for whistleblowers. For less severe problems, staff can use the differing professional opinion (DPO) system to force a review of safety concerns. The DPO process has been inefficient and can be improved, but it still serves a purpose.

The ACRS functions as an independent Federal Advisory Committee Act committee. The AEA requires the ACRS committee to review all licensing actions and provide an independent recommendation to the Commission. The ACRS operates through public meetings, and the recommendations are publicly available. Its mandate is to advise the Commission on the safety and reliability of reactor designs, license applications, and proposed NRC regulations and guidance. By law, the committee must be composed of recognized experts in engineering, risk assessment, materials science, and related disciplines. The ACRS must review and report on all reactor construction permit applications, operating licenses, license renewals, and significant amendments for civilian nuclear reactors.

Through this structure, the AEA intended the ACRS to function as a standing, technically-focused safeguard that operates separately from NRC staff to ensure an independent technical check on regulatory decisions.

Transparency provides another check on the actions of the agency. Public engagement and acceptance is critical to the NRC’s mission to enable the use of nuclear technology. A perceived loss of independent decisions in favor of political mandates will quickly erode public trust. Acknowledging this, the recent executive order mandated that NRC reforms must also “maintain the United States' leading reputation for nuclear safety.”

NRC independence must mean more than simply Commissioner independence from undue federal or industry influence. The AEA established layers of independence within the agency that serve to maintain efficient and effective operation. Protecting internal independence of the NRC staff and the ACRS, along with external transparency, remains critical.

Conclusion

NRC independence may be a misnomer. While the Commission has remained independent from the nuclear industry, it has always been at least partially dependent on the politics of the moment—and by design. The AEA and the ERA established the NRC and its predecessor with clear checks and balances from top to bottom, while accepting that shifting presidential administrations and congressional leadership ultimately will play a role in who is on the Commission and what is prioritized.",https://thebreakthrough.imgix.net/articles/understanding-the-nrc-independence-debate/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/First-Commission.jpg?mtime=1765388983,N,,2025-12-10 18:01:37.422374

He wants to quadruple the U.S.’s nuclear power by 2050.

And Trump isn’t the only president who has lauded the power of nuclear energy; former President Joe Biden also thought it could be a solution to some of the country’s energy problems.

As electricity demand rises, politicians are reconsidering a power source long plagued by high costs and lengthy construction timelines. How big a role will nuclear play in the country’s future energy mix?

Katy Huff, associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, was the Department of Energy’s assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy from 2022 to 2024.

“ If you work backwards from net-zero goals by 2050, for example, then you need an incredible amount of nuclear energy,” Huff said. “It rivals the fastest rate that we’ve ever produced new nuclear power plants in this country.”

5 questions with Katy Huff

We’ve only seen two new nuclear reactors come online in the past decade, at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia in 2023. Those reactors were seven years late and $17 billion over budget. Why is it so difficult to build this stuff?

“ Delays and cost overruns are often because each nuclear power plant build is treated as a first-of-a-kind project. You know, imagine trying to build a commercial airplane when every single part has to be custom-designed and approved by the regulator for the first time. That’s really slow and expensive until you get to a place where you no longer have to approve those parts and design approaches and construction processes.

“But ideally, if you can build more of them on a quick pace shortly after the first few, then you should see some lessons learned. But new reactor designs are also being proposed as well, and they’ll face those first-of-a-kind risks for the first few units.”

One promising technology that we’ve been hearing about for years is something called a small modular reactor. They’re smaller than these typical nuclear plants and, in theory, they’re cheaper and easier to get the permitting for.

How likely are those at this point to play a big role in the future energy mix?

“ I think because those capital costs are going to be lower per unit because they’re a little bit more flexible in terms of deployment in fleets. The hope is that we’ll also get to that nth-of-a-kind quicker if each unit is smaller, but per megawatt hour generated, they probably will be slightly more expensive than the bigger units, which get economies of scale.

“How realistic is it that they’re being built? Well, some of them are being built right now.”

The Biden administration was looking to nuclear power to fulfill some of its climate priorities, but Trump is interested for different reasons. He’s promising $80 billion to build nuclear reactors.

His energy secretary, Chris Wright, said on CNBC last month that early projects will receive government subsidies. How does that sound to you?

“ Because of the enormous capital investment required to build a big, complex, precise machine, government support has played a key role in unlocking private investment, especially through the loan programs office.

“But just as important are those committed customers, whether it’s companies like Dow Chemical or chip manufacturers or data centers. That early demand also helps to reduce risk and build those first few reactors, after which we hope the costs will come down rapidly.”

What is a reasonable timeline for a nuclear revival like this? If we’re talking about meeting electricity demand that’s rising rapidly right now, is a nuclear build-out too slow to be of much help?

“ I think that is a real concern. In order to meet that moment, you’re going to have to build nuclear power plants on time and on budget, even if those budgets are fairly high initially.

“And some of those schedules will take a decade to get a reactor online from start of construction to connection to the grid. Though there is certainly a hope that some smaller reactors might get from construction to grid connection quicker, time will tell, and we’ll have to see whether the U.S. engineering and construction companies involved in these projects are ready for that challenge.”

Have we figured out a solution to the safety problem? Is there still an issue of what to do with nuclear waste?

“ First, it’s important to know that over the last 60, 70 years of commercial nuclear energy in the us, our spent nuclear fuel has never harmed anyone. And while there’s ongoing work in the Department of Energy about where to store it long term, that fuel is currently safely stored at reactor sites right now.

“Reactors themselves have historically been extremely safe in the United States. Even the Three Mile Island accident, which is the worst in our history, killed no one.

“And we have real hopes that some of the passive safety features of this current generation of proposed and existing new construction will be even safer. But it requires strong regulation, and I hope to see that that continues.”

This highlights how vulnerable it can be to invest in a single stock. However, investors in EV-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might take this event as an opportunity to revisit their portfolios, considering that Tesla held 41% of the U.S. EV market as of the third quarter of 2025 (as per data provided by Clean Technica).

This should help an investor to make an informed decision regarding his or her asset allocation in EV-focused ETFs.

Tesla’s Downgrade & Shifting Dominance

Morgan Stanley’s analysts, in addition to downgrading Tesla’s rating, also slashed the company’s delivery forecasts through 2040. Notably, the firm expects Tesla’s delivery volume to decline 10.5% in 2026 and projects an 18.5% reduction in cumulative deliveries through 2040.

This trimmed delivery forecast seems to be the result of Tesla’s eroding dominance in EV market lately. For instance, in China, the world's largest EV market, Tesla's share shrank significantly in late 2025 due to fierce competition from local brands like BYD and Xiaomi.

However, the analysts at Morgan Stanley mentioned that Tesla is ""uniquely positioned to be a leader"" in the humanoid robot market, thanks to its existing manufacturing abilities and technological advantage. To this end, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk has publicly stated that he believes the company’s values to eventually be dominated by its AI and robotics initiatives, specifically the Optimus humanoid robot, rather than its EV business. This reflects the company’s strategic decision to reduce focus on EVs and increase investments in AI, robotics and robotaxis.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/49b19d5f77c2e6fb2ac483c58199d712,N,,2025-12-10 19:58:42.413999

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses EBITDA, EBITDA as a percent of revenue as supplemental non-GAAP measures of performance. The Company uses Free Cash Flow as a supplement non-GAAP liquidity measure. We define the measures as the following:

EBITDA is net (loss) income excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes

EBITDA as a percent of revenue is EBITDA for the measurement period divided by revenue for the same period.

Free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less the impact of purchases of equipment and improvements.

EBITDA and EBITDA as a percent of revenue are non-GAAP measures of performance and are used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its review of operating results for the periods presented. Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP liquidity measure, is used by management to assess our ability to generate cash from our business operations and plan for future operating and capital actions.

Management and the Company's Board utilize these non-GAAP measures to make decisions about the use of the Company's resources, analyze performance between periods, develop internal projections and measure management performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the Company's historical performance.

EBITDA, EBITDA as a percent of revenue, and free cash flow are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and when analyzing our performance and liquidity investors should (i) evaluate adjustments in our reconciliation to the nearest GAAP financial measures and (ii) use non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as an alternative to, measures of our operating results, as defined under GAAP.

Multiple active sites and strong US enrollment continue to support Q3 2026 timing for topline data readout

Clinical trial sites in Canada and the United Kingdom have received regulatory clearance to enroll

All patients who have completed HERO trial to date have successfully enrolled and remain in the Open Label Extension trial

SAN DIEGO, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc. (Aardvark) (Nasdaq: AARD), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, small-molecule therapeutics to activate innate homeostatic pathways for the treatment of metabolic diseases, announced that the first patient has been dosed in Australia in its Phase 3 HERO pivotal clinical trial assessing ARD-101 for the treatment of hyperphagia in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Additionally, regulatory clearance for enrollment by clinical trial sites in Canada and the United Kingdom has also been received. Based on strong enrollment in the US and continued progress in advancing the clinical trial internationally, the clinical trial continues to track towards a topline data readout in Q3 2026.

“We have seen very strong interest in the HERO trial within the patient community, which has been driving enrollment in the United States and in our newly opened Australia sites,” said Tien Lee, M.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Aardvark. “In addition, all patients who have completed the 12-week clinical trial to date have enrolled in the Open Label Extension trial, which is an encouraging indicator of patient interest and engagement.”

US trial sites are actively enrolling, and sites in Australia started enrolling in November. Enrollment is expected to initiate shortly in Canada and the UK, where regulatory clearance has been received. At this time, Aardvark anticipates that it will not need to activate previously planned sites in the EU to fully enroll the HERO trial and meet its anticipated timeline for topline data readout in Q3 2026.

“It’s important to note that significant unmet needs continue to persist in the PWS community, and many families are eager for a therapy that could ameliorate the relentless hunger that is a hallmark of PWS,” added Manasi Jaiman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Aardvark.

About the HERO Trial

The Hunger Elimination or Reduction Objective (HERO) trial ( NCT06828861 ) is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing ARD-101 for the treatment of hyperphagia in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Aardvark plans to enroll 90 patients in this clinical trial across the US, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and South Korea. The primary endpoint is change in the Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT) score from baseline to Week 12. Secondary outcome measures include change in Caregiver Global Impression of Severity (CaGI-S) for hyperphagia in PWS patients and change in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) score for hyperphagia in PWS patients. Topline data is expected in the third quarter of 2026.

About ARD-101

ARD-101 is a gut-restricted small molecule agonist of select taste receptors (TAS2Rs) expressed on the luminal side of the intestine. As a potent bitter taste receptor pan-agonist, ARD-101 stimulates enteroendocrine cells of the digestive tract to release multiple gut-peptide hormones, including GLP-1 and the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which activates gut-brain neurologic signaling to mediate hunger. ARD-101 has demonstrated an ability to reduce hunger when used alone or in combination with currently available GLP-1 therapies. The FDA has granted ARD-101 both Orphan Drug Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for PWS.

ARD-101 is being evaluated in the Phase 3 HERO trial for hyperphagia associated with PWS.

About Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc.

Aardvark is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, small-molecule therapeutics designed to suppress hunger for the treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrome and metabolic diseases. Hunger, which is the discomfort from not having eaten recently, is a distinct neural signaling pathway separate from appetite, the reward-seeking desire for food. Our programs explore therapeutic applications in hunger-associated indications and potential complementary uses with anti-appetite therapies. Our lead compound, oral ARD-101, is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of hyperphagia associated with PWS, a rare disease characterized by insatiable hunger. Aardvark is also developing ARD-201, a planned fixed-dose combination of ARD-101 with a DPP-4 inhibitor, through two separate Phase 2 trials with a goal of addressing some of the limitations of currently marketed GLP-1 therapies for obesity and obesity-related conditions.

Preclinical data demonstrate BBO-10203 blocks RAS-mediated activation of PI3Kα, strongly inhibits pAKT signaling in tumor cells without inducing hyperglycemia, and shows robust anti-tumor activity both as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care therapies in mutant or wild-type PIK3CA breast cancer models

BBOT will also present a trial in progress poster on BREAKER-101, a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating BBO-10203 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, HR+/HER2- breast cancer, KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, and KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer with initial Phase 1 data expected in the first half of 2026

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Oncology Therapeutics, Inc. (“BBOT”) (Nasdaq: BBOT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on RAS-pathway malignancies, today announced late-breaking preclinical data on BBO-10203, a first-in-class covalent small molecule RAS:PI3Kα breaker that selectively and specifically blocks the physical interaction between RAS and PI3Kα resulting in the inhibition of RAS-driven PI3Kα-AKT signaling in tumors without inducing hyperglycemia. The data is being presented today at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). BBOT will also present a trial in progress poster on the Phase 1 BREAKER-101 trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, HR+/HER2- breast cancer, KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, and KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer on Friday, December 12.

“PIK3CA mutations are common, particularly in HR+/HER2- and HER2+ advanced breast cancer,” said Andreas Varkaris, MD, PhD, Attending Physician and Investigator at Massachusetts General Hospital and an investigator in the BREAKER-101 study. “Historically, we have treated these patients with successive generations of PI3K inhibitors, which have their limitations. We now look forward to a new generation of inhibitors, such as BBO-10203, that can more selectively target the mutant enzyme without affecting normal cells, potentially enabling us to treat more patients. Importantly, by improving selectivity and tolerability, these next-generation agents may also allow for combinations with other targeted therapies, something that was challenging in the past due to toxicity.”

“Although PI3Kα inhibitors have provided an important treatment option for HR+/HER2- and HER2+ breast cancer with PI3Kα mutations, their use is often limited by dose-dependent hyperglycemia and reduced treatment duration,” said Pedro Beltran, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of BBOT. “Our preclinical work shows that BBO-10203 offers a differentiated mechanism by disrupting the RAS–PI3Kα interaction rather than inhibiting PI3Kα’s kinase activity. Because RAS-dependent activation drives tumor growth but not glucose regulation, this approach enables broad pathway inhibition without the risk of hyperglycemia. BBO-10203 also shows strong monotherapy and combination activity, underscoring its potential to extend treatment responses alongside standard-of-care therapies.”

Late Breaking Preclinical Data Highlights

Preclinical findings demonstrate BBO-10203 covalently binds PI3Kα on cysteine 242 in the RAS binding domain, which prevents the interaction of PI3Kα and RAS.

Oral administration of BBO-10203 resulted in robust PK, dose- and time-dependent inhibition of pAKT, and efficacy.

BBO-10203 did not induce hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia in an oral glucose tolerance test.

BBO-10203 showed activity alone and in combination with fulvestrant or ribociclib in ER+ HER2- breast cancer models with either a PIK3CA helical or kinase domain mutations.

Similar efficacy was observed with BBO-10203 or STX-478 (LY4064809), a PIK3CA mutant-selective inhibitor, in an ER+ HER2- breast cancer model with a PIK3CA kinase domain mutation.

BBO-10203 also showed activity alone and in combination with ribociclib in an ER+ HER2- breast cancer model with wild-type PIK3CA.

Trial in Progress Poster

BREAKER-101 (NCT06625775) is a first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, Phase 1a/1b study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BBO-10203 as monotherapy and in combination with trastuzumab, fulvestrant ± ribociclib, or FOLFOX + bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, HR+/HER2- breast cancer, KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, and KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer. The study includes a dose escalation phase as well as an expansion phase. Key endpoints include safety and tolerability, anti-tumor activity, and pharmacokinetics. Intracranial activity of BBO-10203 will also be evaluated as an exploratory endpoint. The study is currently enrolling patients in the United States and Australia, and initial Phase 1 clinical data are expected in the first half of 2026.

A copy of the posters titled “BBO-10203, a first-in-class breaker of the RAS:PI3Kα interaction, inhibits tumor growth alone and in combination with fulvestrant or ribociclib in breast cancer models without inducing hyperglycemia” and “BREAKER-101: a phase 1a/1b open-label study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of BBO-10203 in patients with advanced solid tumors” will be available on the “ Publications ” page of the BBOT website following the conference.

About BBO-10203

BBO-10203 is an orally bioavailable small molecule with a novel mechanism of action designed to inhibit the physical interaction between RAS and PI3Kα, inhibiting RAS-driven PI3Kα-AKT signaling in tumors. BBO-10203 binds directly and covalently to the RAS-binding domain of PI3Kα, preventing its activation by KRAS, HRAS and NRAS, reducing downstream signaling and tumor growth. It is a protein-protein inhibitor and not a kinase inhibitor, enabling inhibition of RAS-driven PI3Kα-AKT signaling in tumors without the risk of hyperglycemia. Importantly, BBO-10203’s ability to block RAS activation of PI3Kα is agnostic to the mutational status of either RAS or PI3Kα . In addition to a potentially differentiated safety profile, BBO-10203 could be combined with direct KRAS inhibitors, such as BBO-8520 and BBO-11818, or drugs that target HER2 or ER receptors. BBO-10203 is being evaluated in the Phase 1 BREAKER-101 trial (NCT06625775) for patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, HR+/HER2- breast cancer, KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, and KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Initial Phase 1 clinical data are expected in the first half of 2026.

Study met its primary endpoint demonstrating that GRI-0621 was well tolerated over 12 weeks of treatment, with no drug-related severe or serious adverse events and no increase in GI issues when used with existing approved treatments

Study met its secondary endpoints and demonstrated improvement in biomarkers of collagen turnover, suggesting a resolution of fibrosis and repair of the alveolar basement membrane

GRI-0621 demonstrated increases in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 6 and 12 weeks of treatment

39% of GRI-0621 treated subjects experienced an increase in FVC at 12 weeks compared to 80% of subjects treated with placebo experiencing a decline in FVC at 12 weeks

LA JOLLA, CA, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GRI Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ: GRI) (“GRI Bio” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company advancing an innovative pipeline of immune cell modulators for the treatment of inflammatory, fibrotic and autoimmune diseases, today announced positive topline data from the Phase 2a GRI-0621-IPF-02 clinical trial evaluating GRI-0621 for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (“IPF”). The study met its primary endpoint and secondary endpoints demonstrating that GRI-0621 was well tolerated over a 12-week treatment period, consistent with earlier studies evaluating over 1,700 subjects treated for up to a year. Subjects treated with GRI-0621 also displayed improvements in serum biomarkers of collagen turnover suggesting fibrosis resolution and induction of an alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism.

“Treatment of patients with IPF in the GRI-0621 Phase 2a trial was observed to be safe and well tolerated through the completion of the 12-week study,” said Toby Maher, MD, PhD, Professor of Clinical Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, USC Los Angeles. “Secondary endpoints related to the effect of GRI-0621 on biomarkers associated with disease progression provided evidence that GRI-0621 maintains a net anti-fibrotic effect compared to standard of care. Lastly, FVC improved in patients treated with GRI-0621, with more patients experiencing an increase at 12 weeks than with standard of care. We look forward to watching the clinical advancement of GRI-0621 as a potential treatment for patients with IPF.”

Study Met Its Primary Endpoint, Demonstrating a Safety Profile Differentiated From Existing Treatment Options

No safety or tolerability concerns were observed in the subjects enrolled at 12 weeks of treatment, with dry skin, dry lips, muscle and joint pain as the most common adverse events reported. There were no increases in cough (0% in the GRI-0621-treated arm compared to 25% in the placebo arm) or gastrointestinal disorders reported in the GRI-0621 arm compared to the placebo arm (diarrhea reported in 13% versus 33%, respectively). 80% of the subjects enrolled were taking background pirfenidone or nintedanib.

Study Met Secondary Endpoints Suggestive of Disease-Modifying Activity, Reversing Fibrosis and Inducing a Lung Repair Mechanism

Subjects treated with GRI-0621 also displayed improvements in serum biomarkers of collagen turnover, suggesting fibrosis resolution and induction of an alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism. PRO-C6, a biomarker of type VI collagen synthesis, was observed to decrease from baseline (-3%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and increase (+12%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. C6M, a biomarker of type VI collagen degradation, was observed to increase from baseline (+6%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and decrease (-3%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. The type VI collagen remodeling rate shifted from fibrogenic (+10%; continued worsening of fibrosis) in placebo-treated subjects to fibrolytic (-7%; resolution of fibrosis), suggestive of GRI-0621 inducing resolution of fibrosis in treated subjects compared to continued worsening of fibrosis in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care.

Destruction of the alveolar basement membrane is a hallmark of IPF, and type IV collagen synthesis, and repair of the basement membrane, is a crucial step in lung tissue repair. PRO-C4, a biomarker of type IV collagen synthesis, was observed to increase from baseline (+9%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and decrease (-2%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. C4Ma3, a biomarker of type IV collagen degradation, was observed to decrease in GRI-0621 treated subjects compared to subjects treated with placebo and standard of care (10% vs 24%, respectively). The type IV collagen remodeling rate shifted from fibrolytic (-16%; continued destruction of the basement membrane) in placebo-treated subjects to neutral (0%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects, suggestive of GRI-0621 inducing a lung tissue repair mechanism and repair of the alveolar basement membrane compared to placebo-treated subjects.

Interestingly, the alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism is supported by differential gene expression data of AT1 cell re-epithelialization of the basement membrane. GRI-0621 was observed to significantly reduce DLK1 (-6.46 LogFC; FDR 0.0003), a gene involved in lung epithelial AT2 cell fate plasticity and regeneration of alveolar AT1 cells (Sawhney, et al. (2025) Nat Commun 16 , 8924; Li, et al. (2025) Resp Res 26 188), another critical step in alveolar basement membrane repair, compared to subjects treated with placebo and standard.

Reductions in neutrophil and macrophage activity (immune cell biomarkers upregulated in IPF and associated with disease progression) and downregulation of genes associated with fibrosis, disease progression and mortality were also observed in patients treated with GRI-0621 compared to placebo-treated subjects.

“The positive Phase 2a results represent an important milestone for our IPF program and a compelling early signal of GRI-0621’s disease-modifying potential. IPF remains one of the most devastating respiratory diseases, with limited treatment options and a significant need for therapies that can do more than slow decline and address the underlying biology of the disease,” commented Marc Hertz, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of GRI Bio. “In addition to a favorable safety and tolerability profile, GRI-0621 demonstrated meaningful improvement in biomarkers suggesting fibrosis resolution and repair of the alveolar basement membrane. These results reinforce our belief in GRI-0621’s differentiated mechanism and support its potential to go beyond slowing disease progression by directly impacting core drivers of IPF. With this mechanistic proof-of-biology in hand, we are well-positioned to advance toward the next stage of development. We believe GRI-0621 could represent a truly meaningful advance in the IPF treatment landscape, with the potential to create significant value for patients and shareholders alike.”

Study Met Exploratory Endpoints Demonstrating Increased Forced Vital Capacity, With Twice as Many Subjects Observed to Have No Decline in FVC Compared to Standard of Care at 12 Weeks

Placebo-adjusted changes from baseline in FVC increased by 99 ml in the GRI-0621-treated arm and a 139 ml increase in the subset taking both GRI-0621 and standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care. Spirometry is subject to large visit-to-visit variability and is dependent on the individual’s effort, often resulting in data outliers. To minimize the impact of outliers in the dataset, a post hoc data analysis was performed excluding the datapoints with the largest gain or loss in FVC over 12 weeks from both arms. The results of this analysis demonstrated an increase in placebo-adjusted change from baseline in FVC of 54 ml in the GRI-0621-treated arm and an increase of 81 ml in the subset taking both GRI-0621 and standard of care. Overall, 39% of GRI-0621 treated subjects experienced an increase in FVC at 12 weeks compared to 80% of subjects who experienced a decline in FVC at 12 weeks in the placebo-treated arm.

The Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, multinational, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-design, 2-arm study enrolled 35 subjects with IPF who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio for GRI-0621 4.5mg or a placebo. GRI-0621 dose of 4.5mg was compared with a dose of placebo following once daily oral administration for 12 weeks. Concurrently, a sub-study examined the number and activity of immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (“BAL”) fluid in 8 subjects (across various centers). The primary endpoint for the Phase 2a study was safety and tolerability of oral GRI-0621 as assessed by clinical labs, vital signs and adverse events after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints were baseline changes in serum biomarkers collected at week 6 and week 12; an assessment of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GRI-0621 at the week 12 visit of treatment (steady state); and a determination of the pharmacodynamic activity of oral GRI-0621 as measured by inhibition of immune cell activation in blood after 6 weeks and 12 weeks, and from BAL fluid after 12 weeks of treatment in the sub-study. Additional exploratory endpoints for the study included assessment of the effect of GRI-0621 on pulmonary function at baseline and after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment and flow cytometry and differential gene expression at various time points. These results show that GRI-0621’s receptor selectivity is consistent with the toxicity profile observed in earlier studies evaluating oral tazarotene in over 1,700 patients treated for up to 52 weeks.

CLAYTON, Mo., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Perimeter Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: PRM) (“Perimeter,” “Perimeter Solutions,” or the “Company”), today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Medical Manufacturing Technologies LLC (“MMT”) from Arcline Investment Management for approximately $685 million in cash, including certain tax benefits.

MMT is a leading provider of highly engineered machinery and associated aftermarket consumables, parts, and services for the manufacturing of minimally invasive medical devices. Nearly all MMT’s revenue is generated from proprietary products and approximately half of its revenue is derived from the aftermarket. MMT is expected to generate approximately $140 million of revenue and $50 million of Adjusted EBITDA on a full-year basis in 2025.

Haitham Khouri, Perimeter Solutions’ Chief Executive Officer, stated, “MMT is an excellent fit with our operating strategy. MMT serves a recurring and growing aftermarket, where it reliably provides highly engineered proprietary parts and consumables that are critical to zero-defect customer workflows and stringent regulatory standards. MMT has a strong track-record of organic and M&A driven growth, both of which we expect to continue.”

Mr. Khouri continued, “We expect MMT to fit seamlessly into our decentralized operating structure, and we believe that the Company is a particularly strong fit with our Operational Value Driver focused operating strategy”.

Perimeter expects to fund the acquisition through $500 million of new secured debt financing and $185 million of cash on hand.

Perimeter Solutions’ Chief Financial Officer Kyle Sable said, “MMT matches our focus on businesses in secularly growing markets with strong free cash flow, high returns on tangible capital, and durable earnings power. As a result of the transaction, we expect to have net leverage profile of approximately 2.7 times net debt to combined Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months ended September 30, 2025, which we believe will be well supported by the cash generation capability of our combined business.”

The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Nixon Peabody and Greenberg Traurig provided legal counsel to Perimeter.

Conference Call and Webcast

Perimeter Solutions management will hold a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, December 11, 2025 to discuss the transaction. The conference call can be accessed by dialing (877) 407-9764 (toll-free) or (201) 689-8551 (toll).

Forward-looking Information

This press release may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “will,” and similar references to future periods. Specific forward-looking statements in this press release include statements regarding the Company’s expectations and beliefs regarding (i) the acquisition of MMT, including the anticipated benefits, closing and funding, (ii) MMT’s full-year revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, (iii) our ability to continue MMT’s track record of growth and (iv) our leverage profile.

Any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company’s control) and assumptions. Although Perimeter believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect the Company’s actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, including the risk factors described from time to time by us in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including, but not limited to, the ability to receive the required regulatory approvals and satisfy other customary closing conditions in order to close the acquisition; the ultimate timing, outcome and results of integrating the operations of MMT and Perimeter; the ability of the combined company to realize anticipated benefits, including the expected leverage profile following completion of the acquisition, in the timeframe expected or at all; changes in capital markets and the ability of the combined company to finance operations in the manner expected; the effects of commodity prices; risks related to the demand for MMT and Perimeters services; and the other factors included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Stockholders, potential investors and other readers should consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's estimates and assumptions with respect to financial performance and future events, and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently difficult to predict.

Any forward-looking statement made by Perimeter in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Perimeter undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

MMT Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, which reflects the Company's internal estimate based on the quality of earnings report received by the Company. MMT Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before income taxes, plus net interest expense and other financing expenses, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-recurring, unusual or non-operational items. These items primarily include restructuring and integration costs, transaction expenses, and implementation and one-time consulting costs. The Company has not provided a GAAP reconciliation of MMT’s expected adjusted EBITDA, which is a forward-looking statement, in this press release as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. MMT Adjusted EBITDA reflects the acquisitions consummated by MMT during the last twelve month period ended September 30, 2025, as if such acquisition occurred as of October 1, 2024.

Forward-Looking Statements

Matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts.

The Partnership desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. The words “believe,” “anticipate,” “intends,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “expect,” “pending” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not intended to give any assurance as to future results and should not be relied upon.

The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions and estimates, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, examination by the Partnership’s management of historical operating trends, data contained in its records and other data available from third parties. Although the Partnership believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond the Partnership’s control, the Partnership cannot assure you that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections.

In addition to these important factors, other important factors that, in the Partnership’s view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed, expressed or implied, in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the strength of world economies and currency fluctuations, general market conditions, including fluctuations in charter rates, ownership days, and vessel values, changes in supply of and demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping capacity, changes in the Partnership’s operating expenses, including bunker prices, drydocking and insurance costs, the market for the Partnership’s vessels, the early termination of Partnership’s charters and the Partnership’s inability to replace assets and/or long-term contracts, the availability of financing and refinancing, changes in governmental laws, rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, economic, regulatory, political and governmental conditions that affect the shipping and the LNG industry, potential liability from pending or future litigation, and potential costs due to environmental damage and vessel collisions, general domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents, political events, or international hostilities, geopolitical events including ongoing conflicts and hostilities in the Middle East and other regions throughout the world and the global response to such conflicts and hostilities, changes in tariffs, trade barriers, including recently imposed tariffs by the U.S. and the effects of retaliatory tariffs and countermeasures from affected countries, the effect of applicable sanctions and embargos; vessel breakdowns, instances of off-hires, the length and severity of epidemics and pandemics, the impact of public health threats and outbreaks of other highly communicable diseases, the amount of cash available for distribution, and other important factors, including those the Partnership describes from time to time in the reports it files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Please see the Partnership’s filings with the SEC for a more complete discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties. The information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof. The Partnership undertakes no obligation, and specifically declines any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable laws. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Partnership to predict all of these factors which may adversely affect its results. Further, the Partnership cannot assess the effect of each such factor on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in any forward-looking statement. If one of more forward-looking statements are updated, no inference should be drawn that additional updates will be made with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.

Transaction Expected to be Accretive to Revenue and Earnings

Expands Product Offerings in the Utility and Industrial Sectors

Expands Revenue in Brazil and Positions for Growth in Latin America

AMSC to Hold Conference Call on December 11, 2025 at 9am.

AYER, Mass., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMSC (NASDAQ: AMSC), a leading system provider of megawatt-scale power resiliency solutions that orchestrate the rhythm and harmony of power on the grid™ and protect and expand the capability of our Navy’s fleet, today announced that it has acquired Comtrafo Indústria de Transformadores Elétricos S.A (Comtrafo), a privately held company based in Brazil that manufactures and supplies high-performance utility-scale power and distribution transformers.

At closing, AMSC purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of Comtrafo for R$300 million (Brazilian Real), approximately US$55 million, in cash and issued 2,417,142 restricted shares of AMSC common stock with a value of approximately US$78 million. AMSC also purchased real property including two factories with over 100 acres of land for approximately R$155.6 million, approximately US$29 million, in cash. As part of the transaction, in the future the selling stockholders may earn an additional earnout in cash upon the achievement of specified earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization objectives during the three years following the closing.

AMSC believes that the acquisition of Comtrafo directly aligns with the company’s strategic priorities to accelerate profitable growth, broaden its product offerings, and expand market reach and share. Comtrafo has a history of profitable revenue. We believe Comtrafo appears positioned to deliver revenue of approximately US$55 million in calendar year 2025, which is now nearly complete. Normalized gross margins on this revenue are expected to be commensurate with recently demonstrated AMSC levels of 30% and normalized operating margins are expected to be about 20%.

Looking ahead into calendar year 2026, Comtrafo has approximately US$85 million in total backlog with about US$55 million falling in the 12-month backlog. By leveraging Comtrafo’s trusted leadership position in the transformer market for utility and industrial applications, AMSC expects to expand its grid business offerings and enhance the value delivered to customers.

“Comtrafo is a leader in Brazil’s critical power infrastructure market for power and distribution transformers,” said Daniel P. McGahn, Chairman, President and CEO of AMSC. “The addition of Comtrafo to AMSC’s grid solutions is expected to accelerate further profitability and expand our offerings of proprietary products to meet growing utility and industrial demand across the full power platform, from power generation to transmission, distribution, and industrial end-use. Comtrafo operates in an estimated US$1.5 billion annual market in Brazil, where the local government has outlined significant planned investment exceeding US$20 billion in the country’s electricity grid. We are very excited about the business prospects in this large market and throughout Latin America.”

For more information about this transaction, please refer to AMSC’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC today.

The continued funding of such contracts may remain subject to annual legislative appropriation, which, if not approved, could reduce our revenue and lower or eliminate our profit; Changes in U.S. government defense spending could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and overall business; Our business and operations may be materially adversely impacted in the event of a failure or security breach of our or any critical third parties' IT Systems or Confidential Information; Failure to comply with evolving data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data, may adversely impact our business and financial results; Our success is dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel and our inability to do so could significantly damage our business and prospects; We may acquire additional complementary businesses or technologies, which may require us to incur substantial costs for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits; A significant portion of our Wind segment revenues are derived from a single customer. If this customer’s business is negatively affected, it could adversely impact our business; Our success in addressing the wind energy market is dependent on the manufacturers that license our designs; Many of our revenue opportunities are dependent upon subcontractors and other business collaborators; Problems with product quality or product performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and prevent us from achieving increased sales and market share; Many of our customers outside of the United States may be either directly or indirectly related to governmental entities, and we could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws outside the United States; We have had limited success marketing and selling our superconductor products and system-level solutions, and our failure to more broadly market and sell our products and solutions could lower our revenue and cash flow; We or third parties on whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters, including events resulting from climate change, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us or our value chain from such events; Uncertainty surrounding our prospects and financial condition may have an adverse effect on our customer and supplier relationships; Pandemics, epidemics, or other public health crises may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations; Adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results; Our international operations are subject to risks that we do not face in the United States, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results; Our products face competition, which could limit our ability to acquire or retain customers; We have operations in, and depend on sales in, emerging markets, including India, and global conditions could negatively affect our operating results or limit our ability to expand our operations outside of these markets. Changes in India’s political, social, regulatory and economic environment may affect our financial performance; Industry consolidation could result in more powerful competitors and fewer customers; Our success could depend upon the commercial adoption of the REG system, which is currently limited, and a widespread commercial market for our REG products may not develop; Increasing focus and scrutiny on environmental sustainability and social initiatives could adversely impact our business and financial results; Growth of the wind energy market depends largely on the availability and size of government subsidies, economic incentives and legislative programs designed to support the growth of wind energy; Lower prices for other energy sources may reduce the demand for wind energy development, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our Wind business; We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information; Our patents may not provide meaningful or long-term protection for our technology, which could result in us losing some or all of our market position; Third parties have or may acquire patents that cover the materials, processes and technologies we use or may use in the future to manufacture our Amperium products, and our success depends on our ability to license such patents or other proprietary rights; There are a number of technological challenges that must be successfully addressed before our superconductor products can gain widespread commercial acceptance, and our inability to address such technological challenges could adversely affect our ability to acquire customers for our products; Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, market price and volume fluctuations, which may prevent our stockholders from selling our common stock at a profit and could lead to costly litigation against us that could divert our management’s attention; Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and the other important factors discussed under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in Part 1. Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, and our other reports filed with the SEC.

The Stoney Creek Watershed Flood Mitigation Pilot Project is a constructed stormwater wetland basin, planted with native vegetation, on Wayne Community College’s (WCC) campus. The $1.6 million nature-based project provides flood reduction in the Stoney Creek Watershed, specifically addressing flooding along Wayne Memorial Drive.

DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson, State Rep. John Bell, WCC President Patricia Pfeiffer and other local officials spoke at the ribbon cutting ceremony today at WCC.

“Because flooding is becoming more frequent and intense throughout our state, strengthening communities’ flood resiliency is an urgent priority,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. “This nature-based project will reduce flooding for residents and businesses, provide valuable wildlife habitat, and connect with the college’s greenway system. We greatly appreciate Representative John Bell’s strong leadership on resilience issues in the General Assembly, which made this project possible.”

“This project is a good example of how DEQ is using funds the General Assembly appropriated to make communities safer and more resilient,” said State Rep. John Bell, who represents much of Wayne County and Goldsboro. “Residents of the county will benefit from less flooding, safer roads and more reliable access to emergency services.”

“The Stoney Creek flood-mitigation project is an investment in the future of our campus and our community,” said Wayne Community College President Pfeiffer. “By reducing the impact of recurring flooding, we are safeguarding the impact on our environment and potential harm to life. This project reflects our commitment to being a responsible community partner and investing in long-term solutions that benefit everyone who lives, works and studies in Wayne County.""

The project’s engineered wetland located along Reedy Creek, a tributary to Stoney Creek, captures runoff from the campus. Water held within this stormwater wetland basin slows the discharge of water to Reedy Creek, reducing water volume and peak flows to adjacent streams. Vegetation planted in the basin stabilizes the soil, improves downstream water quality by absorbing excess pollutants like nitrogen, and creates habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.

The project is the first demonstration site under the DMS Natural Infrastructure Flood Mitigation Program (NIFMP), which the NC General Assembly established in 2020. The program uses natural infrastructure, or projects that restore natural landscapes or emulate natural ecological processes, to reduce flooding in small, targeted watersheds. Projects can include building wetlands, restoring streams and other nature-based solutions that help store water and reduce flooding.

Lessons learned from the pilot will aid in planning for larger solutions statewide and integrate into the department’s Flood Resiliency Blueprint program to enhance community flood resilience. Nature-based solutions, such as this Stoney Creek project, are one of many resilience actions that local communities can use from the Blueprint Program.

DEQ is developing another project in the watershed that will retrofit a pond to retain water and intercept stormwater runoff before discharging into Stoney Creek. The project will decrease peak stormwater discharge, add protection to properties downstream, improve water quality and provide additional ecological benefits. DEQ is also vetting additional natural infrastructure flood reduction projects in the watershed for 2026 and 2027.",https://files.nc.gov/deq/FAVICON.png?VersionId=xRBsyAOxtvx0Q9TLN3ETIaKdsjhl2HsC,N,,2025-12-10 17:01:07.137152

That’s why the bipartisan Standardized Permitting and Expediting Development Act, also known as the SPEED Act, matters.
Congress can either deliver durable permitting reform or continue outsourcing America’s future to Moscow and Beijing.
Or pass meaningful reform, unleash American energy, workers and technology and prove we still fight for us.
The SPEED Act isn’t just another bill.","With all the talk of incredible energy demand projections for the next few years, it’s easy to brush them off as hype. In fact, it’s hard to keep up. Every time we hear a new projection, it’s higher than the last. Just last week, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright said we’re going to need 100 GW of new firm generation capacity within five years due to growing demands from AI and data centers.

How much power is that? Roughly enough to run 72 million American homes. According to the Census Bureau, there are about 148 million homes in the United States. To put it simply, we’ll need to generate enough new electricity in the next five years to power half of all U.S. homes. That herculean task will require laying thousands of miles of new gas pipelines, building transmission lines and substations, and constructing new generation facilities across the country.

And we shouldn’t kid ourselves, if we don’t get it done, somebody else will. Probably China. To the winner go the spoils, and if the AI boom lives up to the hype, that winner could dominate the 21st century both economically and militarily.

Right now, it takes longer to permit an energy project in America than it does to build one, thanks to overlapping reviews and endless litigation that bog down every step of the process. We’ve already ceded ground to competitors like China and Russia. They’re building and exporting energy infrastructure while we’re tied up in paperwork and waiting on signatures.

The National Environmental Policy Act, passed more than 50 years ago, was meant to protect the environment. But decades of red tape have turned it into a political weapon. What was once a decision-making tool is now used to stall projects until investors walk away.

That dysfunction translates directly into lost paychecks, idled rigs and higher costs for American energy. Energy service companies, the backbone of U.S. production, sit idle while projects die on the vine.

Some in Washington call this a necessary tradeoff for environmental protection. But that’s a false choice. In reality, modernizing permitting helps the environment. Stalled liquefied natural gas projects push allies toward higher-emitting Russian alternatives while safer technology sits waiting for approval.

That’s why the bipartisan Standardized Permitting and Expediting Development Act, also known as the SPEED Act, matters. This bipartisan bill, introduced by House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-Ariz.) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), is currently the most viable permitting reform vehicle to move this Congress.

The Trump administration made real progress streamlining reviews, and DOE Secretary Wright has pushed reforms that put outcome over process. But there’s only so much the executive branch can do alone. The SPEED Act builds on that foundation, locking reforms into law and giving investors the certainty they need to move projects forward. That stability drives jobs, lowers costs and keeps America competitive.

For the energy services sector, which supports more than 650,000 jobs nationwide, the stakes could not be higher. While our companies don’t own pipelines or LNG terminals, instead, we supply the people and expertise that keep them running. When permitting slows, everything else does too. Every month lost to red tape is a month American workers are benched and foreign competitors gain ground.

Congress can either deliver durable permitting reform or continue outsourcing America’s future to Moscow and Beijing. Passing the SPEED Act before the end of the year would prove Republicans and Democrats can still come together to solve a problem that directly affects our economy, our energy security and our standing in the world.

Critics claim reform “weakens protections.” That’s false. The SPEED Act keeps environmental standards intact and ensures reviews remain transparent and timely. Agencies still conduct reviews. Communities still have input. But endless lawsuits and bureaucratic delays can no longer be weaponized to kill projects simply because they’re energy-related.

America was built by people who knew how to get difficult things done. We put men on the moon with computers as powerful as today’s wristwatches. We became the world’s leading energy producer through innovation and grit.

The choice before Congress is simple. Stick with the status quo: paralysis by paperwork, idled workers and ceded ground to our adversaries. Or pass meaningful reform, unleash American energy, workers and technology and prove we still fight for us. We can still do what others think is impossible.

The SPEED Act isn’t just another bill. It’s a test of whether Washington can deliver results instead of excuses. Congress should move quickly. Our workers are ready. Our industry’s ready.

He wants to quadruple the U.S.’s nuclear power by 2050.

And Trump isn’t the only president who has lauded the power of nuclear energy; former President Joe Biden also thought it could be a solution to some of the country’s energy problems.

As electricity demand rises, politicians are reconsidering a power source long plagued by high costs and lengthy construction timelines. How big a role will nuclear play in the country’s future energy mix?

Katy Huff, associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, was the Department of Energy’s assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy from 2022 to 2024.

“ If you work backwards from net-zero goals by 2050, for example, then you need an incredible amount of nuclear energy,” Huff said. “It rivals the fastest rate that we’ve ever produced new nuclear power plants in this country.”

5 questions with Katy Huff

We’ve only seen two new nuclear reactors come online in the past decade, at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia in 2023. Those reactors were seven years late and $17 billion over budget. Why is it so difficult to build this stuff?

“ Delays and cost overruns are often because each nuclear power plant build is treated as a first-of-a-kind project. You know, imagine trying to build a commercial airplane when every single part has to be custom-designed and approved by the regulator for the first time. That’s really slow and expensive until you get to a place where you no longer have to approve those parts and design approaches and construction processes.

“But ideally, if you can build more of them on a quick pace shortly after the first few, then you should see some lessons learned. But new reactor designs are also being proposed as well, and they’ll face those first-of-a-kind risks for the first few units.”

One promising technology that we’ve been hearing about for years is something called a small modular reactor. They’re smaller than these typical nuclear plants and, in theory, they’re cheaper and easier to get the permitting for.

How likely are those at this point to play a big role in the future energy mix?

“ I think because those capital costs are going to be lower per unit because they’re a little bit more flexible in terms of deployment in fleets. The hope is that we’ll also get to that nth-of-a-kind quicker if each unit is smaller, but per megawatt hour generated, they probably will be slightly more expensive than the bigger units, which get economies of scale.

“How realistic is it that they’re being built? Well, some of them are being built right now.”

The Biden administration was looking to nuclear power to fulfill some of its climate priorities, but Trump is interested for different reasons. He’s promising $80 billion to build nuclear reactors.

His energy secretary, Chris Wright, said on CNBC last month that early projects will receive government subsidies. How does that sound to you?

“ Because of the enormous capital investment required to build a big, complex, precise machine, government support has played a key role in unlocking private investment, especially through the loan programs office.

“But just as important are those committed customers, whether it’s companies like Dow Chemical or chip manufacturers or data centers. That early demand also helps to reduce risk and build those first few reactors, after which we hope the costs will come down rapidly.”

What is a reasonable timeline for a nuclear revival like this? If we’re talking about meeting electricity demand that’s rising rapidly right now, is a nuclear build-out too slow to be of much help?

“ I think that is a real concern. In order to meet that moment, you’re going to have to build nuclear power plants on time and on budget, even if those budgets are fairly high initially.

“And some of those schedules will take a decade to get a reactor online from start of construction to connection to the grid. Though there is certainly a hope that some smaller reactors might get from construction to grid connection quicker, time will tell, and we’ll have to see whether the U.S. engineering and construction companies involved in these projects are ready for that challenge.”

Have we figured out a solution to the safety problem? Is there still an issue of what to do with nuclear waste?

“ First, it’s important to know that over the last 60, 70 years of commercial nuclear energy in the us, our spent nuclear fuel has never harmed anyone. And while there’s ongoing work in the Department of Energy about where to store it long term, that fuel is currently safely stored at reactor sites right now.

“Reactors themselves have historically been extremely safe in the United States. Even the Three Mile Island accident, which is the worst in our history, killed no one.

“And we have real hopes that some of the passive safety features of this current generation of proposed and existing new construction will be even safer. But it requires strong regulation, and I hope to see that that continues.”

Next week’s list: Next week, the NAM-backed SPEED Act goes to a vote, while other key legislation is moving closer to that point.
Meanwhile, manufacturers are also urging the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Environment Subcommittee to advance key legislation to reform the Clean Air Act.
From modernizing the New Source Review and National Ambient Air Quality Standards programs to improving how the Environmental Protection Agency deals with wildfires and international emissions, the solutions offered by these bills are integral to comprehensive permitting reform.
Why it matters: Eighty percent of manufacturers say the length and complexity of the permitting process is harmful to increasing investment.","“In the spirit of the holiday season, we are calling for legislative action during this year-end work window to deliver a gift of a new, workable permitting system that will fuel America’s manufacturers,” NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons said in a statement this morning.

“Over the next 12 days, the House is primed to tackle comprehensive permitting reform, which will boost American competitiveness and unlock greater investments in manufacturing in America.”

This week’s list: This week, manufacturers are urging House members to vote “yes” on the PERMIT Act and several other crucial pieces of legislation.

The PERMIT Act adopts the NAM’s key recommendations for modernizing the Clean Water Act—reforms that increase certainty for permittees, clarify the scope of the CWA and address bottlenecks that have delayed job-creating projects.

Manufacturers are also calling on legislators to advance the Improving Interagency Coordination for Pipeline Reviews Act, the ePermit Act and the Electric Supply Chain Act—all of which are critical to achieving manufacturers’ vision of energy and AI dominance.

Next week’s list: Next week, the NAM-backed SPEED Act goes to a vote, while other key legislation is moving closer to that point.

The SPEED Act is a cornerstone of “Manufacturing’s Roadmap to AI and Energy Dominance,” the NAM’s blueprint for securing America’s energy and AI leadership. By appropriately shortening environmental review timelines, limiting regulatory and legal uncertainty, expanding categorial exclusions, preventing duplicative reviews and reinforcing recent Supreme Court precedent on the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act, the SPEED Act will accelerate projects essential to meeting rising power demand and lowering energy costs.

Meanwhile, manufacturers are also urging the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Environment Subcommittee to advance key legislation to reform the Clean Air Act. From modernizing the New Source Review and National Ambient Air Quality Standards programs to improving how the Environmental Protection Agency deals with wildfires and international emissions, the solutions offered by these bills are integral to comprehensive permitting reform.

Why it matters: Eighty percent of manufacturers say the length and complexity of the permitting process is harmful to increasing investment.

Eighty-seven percent say they would expand operations, hire more workers or increase wages and benefits if permitting were streamlined, and 68% of manufacturers with permittable projects say they could expand more quickly with a modernized federal permitting system.

The bottom line: “Manufacturers urge policymakers to seize the moment—pass the PERMIT Act and companion bills this week and the SPEED Act next week—and make it easier and more cost-efficient for manufacturers to get shovels in the ground on job-creating projects,” said Timmons.

Checking it twice: “To turn this holiday package into real progress for the country, the Senate must take up the mantle in the new year and advance comprehensive permitting reforms that will empower manufacturers across the country to compete, invest and grow,” Timmons added.",https://nam.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0ee9d52a-1f54-4388-ab4f-5159bf091be5.png,N,,2025-12-10 16:02:02.155656

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is proposing to revise the 2022 fuel economy standards and then raise them between 0.25% and 0.5% annually through 2031.
Reducing the fuel economy requirements is estimated to increase fuel consumption by around 100 billion gallons through 2050.
Earlier this year, Trump signed legislation that ended fuel economy penalties for automakers, and NHTSA said they faced no fines dating back to the 2022 model year.
As IER’s Tom Pyle has argued, “President Trump and the Republicans in Congress must push to completely eliminate fuel economy standards once and for all.","President Donald Trump proposed slashing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards that former President Joe Biden finalized last year, in a move that automakers were looking for and which allows consumers to choose the best type of vehicle that fits their needs. Biden’s fuel economy standards were designed to incentivize more electric vehicle (EV) purchases, making it difficult for gasoline cars to meet the onerous standards. With the change, automakers will no longer be forced to sell EVs at a loss and raise prices on gasoline vehicles to make up the difference. Trump has taken other steps to allow consumers the ability to choose the right vehicle for them, including rescinding EV tax credits and rejecting California’s request for a waiver from federal law to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles after 2035.

According to Reuters, the new recommended standard would significantly reduce the fuel economy requirements from model years 2022 to 2031, requiring 34.5 miles per gallon on average by 2031, down from 50.4 miles per gallon. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is proposing to revise the 2022 fuel economy standards and then raise them between 0.25% and 0.5% annually through 2031. In 2022, the Biden administration increased fuel efficiency by 8% annually for model years 2024-2025 and 10% for 2026. U.S. dealers and others said the new standards are more in line with the vehicles customers want to buy rather than the more costly vehicles automakers have been pushed to produce due to regulations.

The change is expected to reduce average vehicle costs by $930 and save Americans $109 billion over five years. In October, Kelley Blue Book indicated the average price of a new car in the United States topped $50,000 for the first time, up 3.6% year-over-year. Signed into law in 1975, the CAFE standards regulate how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. Reducing the fuel economy requirements is estimated to increase fuel consumption by around 100 billion gallons through 2050.

As reported by Reuters, automakers are expected to save $35 billion through 2031, including $8.7 billion for GM and more than $5 billion for Ford and Stellantis. Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company would invest more in affordable vehicles. “Today is a victory for common sense and affordability… We believe that people should be able to make a choice.” According to GM CEO Mary Barra, before Congress blocked California’s zero-emission vehicle rules in June, the auto sector was facing requirements in some states that 35% of new vehicles sold in 2026 must be electric. “We were going to have to start shutting down plants because we weren’t going to be able to build and sell those vehicles,” Barra said. She, however, reaffirmed the carmaker’s commitment to electric vehicles.

Reuters adds that the proposal is also seeking to make changes to the credit trading program, including the elimination of credit trading among automakers in 2028, and ending some credits for fuel-saving features. According to NHTSA, credit trading was a “windfall for EV-exclusive manufacturers that sell credits to other non-EV manufacturers.” Ending credit trading could hurt EV manufacturers such as Tesla and Rivian, which have sold credits to companies that make gas-powered vehicles and cannot meet the standards. Earlier this year, Trump signed legislation that ended fuel economy penalties for automakers, and NHTSA said they faced no fines dating back to the 2022 model year. The increase in vehicle emissions from NHTSA’s proposal in 2035 would be the equivalent of annual emissions from 7.7 million vehicles over the Biden proposal.

Trump’s Prior Actions

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed financial penalties for automakers that do not meet fuel efficiency requirements and ended the EV tax credit on September 30. Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since then. In November, electric vehicles accounted for 5.3% of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales — less than half the record high in September. Ford’s November unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49% compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59%. The president also signed a law to block California from enforcing a ban on new gas-powered car sales — a waiver that the state received under the Biden administration that allowed it to set its own rule and that other states could follow.

Analysis

Under the Obama and Biden administrations, CAFE transformed from a fuel efficiency measure to a de facto EV mandate, requiring automakers to replace their profitable, affordable vehicles with EVs. The Trump administration’s changes will help bring it back in line with its original intent; however, CAFE’s vehicle market distortions will continue to burden consumers and automakers with higher prices and fewer options until it is fully repealed. As IER’s Tom Pyle has argued, “President Trump and the Republicans in Congress must push to completely eliminate fuel economy standards once and for all. It’s time to repeal CAFE and let the market determine the future of the automobile industry.”",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-28-at-9.46.13-AM-1024x635.png,N,,2025-12-10 15:00:55.818427

The vehicles co-developed by Ford and Renault will be built at Ampere’s ElectriCity plant in the north of France.
""This partnership shows the strength of our partnership know-how and competitiveness in Europe,"" Renault CEO François Provost said in a statement.

They'll explore joint development and manufacturing of Ford- and Renault-branded commercial vehicles.","Ford Motor Co. will develop two passenger electric vehicles for Europe with French rival Renault SA, and the two automakers will explore collaboration on light commercial vehicles.

The companies announced the partnership on Tuesday after the European Commission delayed a meeting scheduled this week to advance an automotive package that could weaken a 2035 ban on new carbon dioxide-emitting vehicles. Ford and other legacy automakers say the regulation is unfeasible, calling for policy in alignment with consumer demand that extends the life of hybrids.

“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” Jim Farley, president and CEO of Ford, said in a statement. “How we compete here — how we innovate, partner, and invest — will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”

The Ford-Renault partnership is a sign of the challenges with EVs. Low volumes as consumers hesitate over range anxiety, access to charging infrastructure and slow charging speeds can render EVs unprofitable or unaffordable. Sharing Renault's Ampere smart EV platform for two Ford-branded models that will arrive starting in early 2028 helps to create scale needed for profitability. Ford declined to disclose expected pricing.

EVs represent 16% of European new-car sales, below the 25% of new vehicle registrations required to meet Europe’s 2025 CO2 targets. The Dearborn automaker called for a ""realistic and reliable 10-year planning horizon"" that allows consumers to drive hybrids for longer instead of forcing a change they aren't ready to make.

“We need to enable everyone to benefit from electrification and letting customers choose — whether that’s fully electric or hybrid vehicles,” Jim Baumbick, the new president of Ford Europe, said in a statement. “It is about making the transition more attractive and more affordable for all consumers and businesses, stimulating demand rather than stifling it.”

Added Farley in a Monday op-ed in the Financial Times: ""Setting unrealistic regulations only to adjust them at the end of each year when consumers do not show up is a recipe for turmoil.""

The tension centers around environmental concerns and fears over competition from the Chinese, who already are producing low-cost EVs and have the capacity to produce every new vehicle sold in Europe. U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced relaxed fuel economy standards through 2031.

Ford argues that with manufacturers investing hundreds of billions of dollars into EVs, governments must match that commitment with consistent purchase incentives on which several nations have pulled back and a charging infrastructure that extends beyond urban areas.

The vehicles co-developed by Ford and Renault will be built at Ampere’s ElectriCity plant in the north of France. Ampere is an EV and software subsidiary of Renault that it had planned to spin off, but the company changed those plans last year.

""This partnership shows the strength of our partnership know-how and competitiveness in Europe,"" Renault CEO François Provost said in a statement. ""In the long term, combining our strengths with Ford will make us more innovative and more responsive in a fast-changing European automotive market.""

The Blue Oval said it'll lead the design and driving dynamics of the vehicles to ensure they are distinctly Ford. The vehicles are the start of a new generation of multi-energy vehicles in Europe from the company. A news release notes its Valencia plant in Spain will play a role in those product plans.

Ford and Renault also have also signed a letter of intent for a European light commercial vehicle collaboration. They'll explore joint development and manufacturing of Ford- and Renault-branded commercial vehicles.

Ford also called aggressive CO2 regulations in Europe on commercial vehicles an ""economic tax on the backbone of Europe,"" citing that 8% of vans are electric. The company suggested it unfairly penalizes small- and medium-sized businesses.

Ford in 2024 said it was cutting 4,000 jobs in Europe by the end of 2027 mostly in Germany and the United Kingdom. The move was made to focus on its Ford Pro commercial business that represents most of its revenues there, reduce costs, and respond to underperforming EV sales.

""To be clear, the industry is not asking for a bailout,"" Farley wrote in the op-ed. ""We are not asking for protectionism to shield inefficiency. At Ford, we will continue to do the hard work of restructuring. We have closed legacy facilities, reduced our workforce and slimmed down costs to become more agile.""

Renault isn't Ford's first European partnership. Ford Otosan is its joint venture with Koç Holding that builds commercial vans in Turkey. The Blue Oval also collaborates with Volkswagen AG on commercial and passenger vehicles.

With 80% of the world’s offshore wind potential located in deeper waters, floating offshore wind will be critical to delivering the UK’s future energy needs.","25 years ago this week, the UK switched on its very first offshore wind farm off the coast of Blyth in north-east England.

It was a very different world back then: Google was only two years old, Vladimir Putin had just taken office in the Kremlin, and Pembrokeshire-born David Gray was finding global fame with his hit single 'Babylon'. Wikipedia was just around the corner, and the iPhone was still a glint in Apple’s eye. Or so I’m told – given the breakthrough at Blyth took place a month before I was born.

As offshore wind and I reach our respective 25th birthdays, I’m taking a moment to reflect on the story so far in Wales and look forward to how this technology is shaping up to power our future, delivering clean Welsh energy for decades to come.

When did offshore wind begin in Wales?

At the turn of the millennium, offshore wind was still the new kid on the block — innovative but unproven, and far from the economic heavyweight and reliable clean-power source it is today. The first two turbines off Blyth, producing just 4MW between them, were essentially an experiment to see whether offshore wind could work at all.

That’s why you could argue that the real take-off moment for offshore wind happened in North Wales. Just three years later, in 2003, North Hoyle off the coast from Rhyl became not only Wales’ first offshore wind farm but the UK’s first major offshore project. Jumping from two turbines to thirty, and from 4MW to 60MW, North Hoyle marked a dramatic step-change. It not only proved offshore wind could scale, but also paving the way for the industry we know today.

By 2009, offshore wind was rapidly becoming an industrial force, and one of our strongest tools in tackling climate change. That year, RWE’s Rhyl Flats wind farm came online five miles out from Llandudno. Delivering 90MW of clean electricity, enough to power around 70,000 homes, it marked another major leap forward, and has cut 1.7 million tonnes of carbon emissions over its lifetime. And the pace of growth continued. Just six years later, in 2015 off the same North Wales coast, Gwynt y Môr was commissioned. At 576MW and 160 turbines, it became one of the largest offshore wind farms in the world.

In the space of just 12 years, Wales had gone from the 60MW North Hoyle site to a project almost ten times larger. Offshore wind had leapfrogged from two pilot turbines in Blyth to one of Europe’s flagship clean energy assets in barely a decade and a half.

But here’s the stark reality: Gwynt y Môr was also the last offshore wind farm built in Wales. It’s now ten years since it was completed.

In other words, the last time Wales built offshore wind, I was still doing my GCSEs!

The great Celtic comeback

Wales’ offshore wind story isn’t over though, far from it. Two new offshore projects planned for North Wales are eligible to compete in this year’s Clean Power Auction, offering the chance to restart construction after almost a decade of pause.

But the real step change, the technology that will redefine the Welsh role in the UK energy system, is happening further south and west in the Celtic Sea. If North Wales was a trailblazer in fixed-bottom offshore wind, South and West Wales will now lead the UK’s floating offshore wind revolution: bigger, more powerful, and able to operate in deeper waters where traditional turbines can’t go. With The Crown Estate’s Leasing Round 5 in the Celtic Sea now complete, Wales is on the brink of hosting one of the most exciting renewables developments in the world.

Three sites have been secured by Equinor, Gwynt Glas, and Ocean Winds, which together are set to deliver:

4.5GW of clean power

More than 5,000 jobs supported and a £1.4 billion boost to the UK economy.

One of the largest floating offshore wind deployments anywhere on the planet.

Beyond that, the Crown Estate is progressing plans to deliver 12GW of floating offshore wind capacity in the Celtic Sea by 2035. For Wales, this represents a roaring comeback for offshore wind and a leap into a new era of industrial opportunity, jobs, innovation, and global leadership.

By the time I turn 50, Wales’ electricity demand is expected to double, and perhaps even treble, as transport, heating, and industry switch to clean power. Meeting that demand will require a transformation every bit as significant as the revolutions that shaped the country’s industrial past.

With 80% of the world’s offshore wind potential located in deeper waters, floating offshore wind will be critical to delivering the UK’s future energy needs. The Climate Change Committee estimates we will need 100GW of offshore wind by 2050. And, once again, Wales is positioned to lead.

But getting there depends on the choices we make now. Onshore wind is the runway to that success. It is the near-term opportunity that equips Welsh workers with the skills they need, readies Welsh businesses to grow capacity, and strengthens our ports and supply chain to prepare for the scale of floating offshore wind to come.

Just as Welsh coal powered the steam age, and Welsh steel built bridges, ships, and skylines across the world, we now have the chance to drive a new industrial revolution. In my lifetime offshore wind in Wales has grown from an emerging technology into one of the foundational economic growth areas of the 21st century.

And while David Gray is no longer topping the charts 25 years on, one thing hasn’t changed. Vladimir Putin is still very much in power and his invasion of Ukraine was a stark reminder that Wales' and the UK’s energy security can never again depend on volatile global fossil fuel markets. The case for home-grown, clean power has never been stronger.

What began with 60MW in North Hoyle has now reached 726MW of offshore capacity here in Wales. Over the next decade, that could rise to more than 5GW. As countries across the world race to adopt offshore wind, Wales will be remembered as one of the early pioneers - paving the way for current and future generations to enjoy a safer, more secure planet, running on clean, affordable energy.",https://www.renewableuk.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-10 19:00:48.972003

Several high-value projects—including highway corridor modernization, logistics hub expansions, EV-supply-chain facilities, and bridge upgrades—depend on conformity analyses tied to ozone status.
Under Moderate status, contractors and public agencies will need clearer plans for idle reduction, equipment upgrades, or temporary offsets that prevent exceedances during peak construction seasons.
What This Means as 2026 Approaches Michigan must now develop and submit a complete RACT SIP and demonstrate implementation before EPA revisits Detroit’s attainment status.","The Sixth Circuit has partially overturned EPA’s decision to redesignate the Detroit ozone nonattainment area, ruling that the agency cannot approve attainment status unless all Moderate nonattainment controls are fully in place. The court upheld EPA’s wildfire-related data adjustments but rejected the redesignation itself, restoring regulatory requirements that will shape how Southeast Michigan advances transportation, industrial, and IIJA-funded infrastructure projects in 2026.

A Split Decision on Science and Procedure

In Sierra Club v. EPA, the court reviewed a 2023 EPA action that relied on two components: excluding two wildfire-influenced ozone days from Detroit’s design value calculation and redesignating the area to attainment. Judges agreed with EPA’s technical assessment of the June 2022 Canadian wildfire smoke event, finding the agency relied on a clear set of meteorological indicators, satellite data, and chemical signatures that supported a causal link to elevated ozone levels.

The outcome shifted, however, when the court examined Detroit’s redesignation. Because the region was bumped from Marginal to Moderate status after missing its attainment deadline, Michigan was required to implement Moderately classified ozone controls—most notably RACT for VOC and NOₓ sources—before EPA could approve attainment. Those obligations were still outstanding in May 2023. The court concluded that EPA cannot disregard statutory requirements based on the timing of a state’s request and vacated the redesignation.

Infrastructure Consequences With Immediate Reach

Restoring Detroit’s Moderate classification has direct implications for infrastructure planning across the region. Several high-value projects—including highway corridor modernization, logistics hub expansions, EV-supply-chain facilities, and bridge upgrades—depend on conformity analyses tied to ozone status. Remaining in Moderate classification shifts the burden back toward stricter review.

Transportation conformity.

IIJA-funded projects involving added capacity must now demonstrate compliance with SIP budgets that remain constrained without a RACT-backed emissions foundation. This may lengthen modeling timelines or require additional mitigation strategies before approvals move forward.

Industrial development.

Manufacturing expansions—particularly automotive and battery-related operations—must now undergo more detailed permitting for NOₓ and VOC emissions. RACT requirements will influence technology choices, operational strategies, and deployment schedules.

Construction-phase emissions.

Major projects generate temporary emissions from diesel fleets and detour traffic. Under Moderate status, contractors and public agencies will need clearer plans for idle reduction, equipment upgrades, or temporary offsets that prevent exceedances during peak construction seasons.

A National Signal for Ozone Governance

The decision also marks another indication that courts, post-Loper Bright, are reading the Clean Air Act more strictly. EPA’s historical flexibility around redesignations—particularly in regions trying to secure quicker permitting environments—may face more challenges. Other states that used early redesignation requests to soften the impact of bump-ups may now need to revisit whether all statutory control measures were in place.

What This Means as 2026 Approaches

Michigan must now develop and submit a complete RACT SIP and demonstrate implementation before EPA revisits Detroit’s attainment status. Until then, the regulatory environment across the region will remain more demanding for transportation agencies, industrial operators, and developers planning long-term infrastructure investments.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251209-184038-da7-Detroit%20City%20Street%20during%20the%20day.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 15:01:37.774941

Craig Pritzlaff, acting assistant administrator of EPA’s enforcement office, said the memo “reinforces a ‘compliance first’ orientation as the guiding principle” for the program, including for all civil enforcement and compliance initiatives at the agency.
They warned the guidance could stall staff from using measures to stop repeat offenders and stagnate enforcement action at EPA.
“The purpose of a compliance first orientation is to ensure that enforcement actions are tailored to achieve compliance faster and that enforcement in general is conducted consistently across EPA,” Hirsch said.

Craig Pritzlaff, acting assistant administrator of EPA’s enforcement office, said the memo “reinforces a ‘compliance first’ orientation as the guiding principle” for the program, including for all civil enforcement and compliance initiatives at the agency. The memo, obtained by POLITICO’s E&E News, also tells employees to seek approval from top leadership, pulls back guidance from the previous administration and bars mitigation efforts, known as supplemental environmental projects, or SEPs.

“This policy reinforces prioritizing environmental compliance across all OECA civil judicial and administrative enforcement activities in the most efficient, most economical, and swiftest means possible,” Pritzlaff said in the memo, dated Friday and sent to senior enforcement officials and attorneys across the country.

Former EPA officials said the agency already emphasized securing compliance first before digging further into its enforcement toolkit to crack down on those who breached environmental laws. They warned the guidance could stall staff from using measures to stop repeat offenders and stagnate enforcement action at EPA.

“When an entity fails to comply with EPA’s regulations, the agency needs to do more than simply give the violator another chance to comply,” said Larry Starfield, who served more than 30 years at EPA, including as the principal deputy assistant administrator in its enforcement office.

Starfield added when a facility repeatedly emits too much pollution, “The government can either say ‘try harder this time,’ or it can require objectively reliable measures” such as more air quality monitoring and data sharing with the public.

In response to questions for this story, EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement the whole point of the Friday memo is “to speed up enforcement and compliance,” adding it takes far too long to bring a facility in line with the law.

“The purpose of a compliance first orientation is to ensure that enforcement actions are tailored to achieve compliance faster and that enforcement in general is conducted consistently across EPA,” Hirsch said.

Memo ‘messing my day up’

Gary Jonesi, who served almost 40 years at EPA, including as an enforcement official, disagrees with that assessment.

“This memo makes it harder for EPA staff to enforce because it removes several incentives that violators have to settle cases and erects procedural barriers to rapid enforcement,” said Jonesi, now executive director of CREEDemocracy.

The new guidance is already having an impact on EPA’s enforcement work, according to agency staffers granted anonymity because they fear retaliation.

One EPA employee said they have been told to pause settlement negotiations. “It’s messing my day up,” they said about the memo.

A second staffer said “compliance first” sounds like “compliance only,” adding “that policy leans heavily towards the regulated community.”

A third employee pointed to one part of the memo that they called “particularly egregious.” That section said when those regulated by EPA have questions about how the agency has applied the law, those questions “must be elevated immediately” and decisions on how to proceed should be made at “a national level.”

“Inspectors and enforcement staff, including attorneys, are not responsible for resolving an ambiguity or concern,” the memo said.

“A regulated entity always raises concerns about EPA’s application of a statute. But those concerns are often recurring across cases and dispensed with easily,” the employee said. “This says we don’t dispense with them. We elevate them. This will stop all meaningful cases in their tracks.”

Hirsch with EPA said enforcement’s purpose is “to achieve compliance quickly” and remediate any releases required under law. If inspections show noncompliance repeatedly, “then additional enforcement would be applicable,” she said.

“It is unfortunate that a small number of employees have seen fit to publicly misrepresent the memorandum without even attempting to discuss their concerns and reach a common understanding with their colleagues,” the agency spokesperson said.

Laura Thoms, who served nearly 20 years at the Department of Justice, including earlier this year as assistant section chief for its Environmental Enforcement Section, found the memo’s directive “alarming” that enforcement must stop if a regulated entity raises concerns.

“This places the ability to delay enforcement directly in the hands of polluters,” said Thoms, now director of enforcement at Earthjustice, noting their questions will swamp EPA as the agency investigates thousands of facilities each year.

“Delaying enforcement means that more pollution is spewed into the air, more waste is dumped into rivers, and more communities are put at risk,” she said.

Biden-era guidance gone, SEPs no more

Pritzlaff’s memo is similar to other guidance issued by the Trump EPA. Jeffrey Hall, then EPA’s acting enforcement head, directed staff in a March 12 memo to ease enforcement on energy facilities and no longer consider environmental justice.

President Donald Trump nominated Hall to lead EPA’s enforcement program, but he has not been confirmed yet. Pritzlaff, formerly director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s enforcement program, joined the agency in August as principal deputy assistant administrator in that office.

Pritzlaff, in his memo, also voids guidance issued during the Biden administration for advocating “expansive remedies,” such as advanced monitoring, third-party audits and electronic reporting. “The 2021 memorandum is overly broad in its approach and therefore is rescinded,” he said.

Injunctive relief outside of the law and regulation may be appropriate in “limited, case-specific circumstances” but should be only by approved by the head of EPA’s enforcement office.

Starfield signed that 2021 memo. He said the new memo’s guidance will weaken enforcement because bringing violators into compliance is not enough.

“Allowing the use of the enforcement tools in the 2021 memo only as a last resort in emergency or other extreme situations will hamstring efforts to prevent repeat violations and will weaken EPA’s ability to protect human health,” Starfield said.

In addition, Pritzlaff’s memo targets the agency’s use of supplemental environmental projects for settlements. Polluters agree to fund those projects to improve the environment, which could be an air quality sensor or even a hiking trail.

“Until additional guidance on the use of SEPs in settlement agreements is issued, no settlement shall include a SEP,” the memo said.

Republican lawmakers have criticized the projects as government handouts, which the Biden administration restored at EPA after they were prohibited during Trump’s first term.

“The regulated community likes these,” Jonesi said about SEPs. “They are voluntary projects with a strong nexus to the violations, and they can significantly reduce a violator’s penalty and make it look a little better in local communities and beyond.”

Worries about environmental enforcement have spiked during the Trump administration.

The Justice Department and EPA have seen an exodus of staff, which will only increase the workload on those that remain in government. In turn, fewer cases could be filed against polluters and less money won in penalties and settlements.

“Polluting is easy. Meeting legal requirements that protect human health and the environment costs money,” Thoms said. “Without enforcement, there’s little incentive to comply.”

Hirsch, the EPA spokesperson, said the Trump administration has concluded as many civil enforcement actions as in the same period last year. The agency is focused on “achieving compliance as quickly as possible” rather than pushing “broad injunctive relief that goes beyond what the law requires and unfairly and unlawfully burdens industry and energy,” she said.

Pritzlaff’s memo, however, could heighten anxiety that enforcement will slow at the agency.

“Well, I could see how it could be used to end enforcement as we know it,” the third EPA employee said. “But then again, under Trump, no enforcement is getting done.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/57/19/c3b865874046a940a47fb353bf72/epa-headquarters-64893.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 15:01:14.892766

The advantages of GSI are widely recognized within the field of water management, and public awareness of GSI is growing as well.

Still, GSI implementation is not widespread in new builds or developments in Texas. So, how can GSI researchers help communities increase green stormwater infrastructure implementation?

This is a question that researchers have been trying to answer for years, including Fouad Jaber, Ph.D., a Texas A&M AgriLife professor and extension specialist in Dallas, who has been working with builders for more than a decade to increase green development practices.

In the Houston area, Aiyana Baptiste, a green infrastructure associate at Texas A&M AgriLife’s Green Infrastructure for Texas (GIFT), also works with city engineers, public works directors, and other municipal staff who develop policies around building and infrastructure development.

Baptiste and Jaber have found that it is essential to understand why people are hesitant about GSI before attempting to bridge the gap between research findings and everyday use.

Barriers to implementation

They have encountered many reasons that people don’t want to implement green stormwater infrastructure (GSI). One of those barriers is that GSI isn’t typical.

“It’s a new thing that challenges the accepted rule,” Jaber said. “Engineers learn how to design pipes, maybe detention ponds, and move on. And here you are. You’re telling them there’s this amazing thing that does beautiful stuff. It’s a depression with soil and plants, and it’s just hard to accept that you can put soil and plants and reduce the size of your pipe. You know, it’s just not typical.”

Another barrier is the misconception that it’s too expensive or hard to maintain, according to Jaber and Baptiste. This misconception is understandable. To many people, GSI is a new, unfamiliar solution. It can actually be a cost-effective solution, though.

Rain gardens, sunken areas of dirt filled with plants that help rain to soak into the ground, can be less expensive than traditional system replacement, according to a research study coauthored by Jaber. And that doesn’t include the ecosystem services they provide.

Additionally, the size and cost of GSI vary. For larger projects, grants are available, and options like using native plants can reduce costs, according to Baptiste. She encourages finding GSI solutions that fit each area’s needs and resources.

“GSI doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing approach,” Baptiste said. “Even small-scale projects like rain gardens, bioswales, or permeable pavements can make a real impact and inspire bigger changes over time. It’s about finding solutions that fit the community and its needs. There are grants, technical support, and real examples out there to help get started!”

Despite the misconceptions, GSI maintenance can also be lower-cost and easier than traditional structures.

“It’s actually not very expensive,” Jaber said. “If you have a median with turf grass on it, you have to mow it and water it weekly in the summer. That is way more maintenance than having a rain garden where you have to check it once a month to make sure nothing is wrong. There’s not any mowing needed, maybe some weeding here and there.”

Tips for cost-effective GSI implementation:

Use native plants, which require less maintenance since they are adapted to thrive in their native climate.

Build rain gardens instead of traditional system replacement.

Apply for grants and other financial funding opportunities.

Replace medians with rain gardens.

But not everyone can replace medians with rain gardens. Many cities have rules against altering these areas, and some cities also have limitations on practices like rainwater harvesting. City ordinance issues like these can be another barrier to implementation for builders.

In a 2022 study that Jaber coauthored, researchers found that barriers to GSI implementation exist in socio-cultural, financial, technical, biophysical, institutions and governance, and legislative and regulatory areas.

Solutions

So, what can be done to help more communities use GSI practices to protect their water and natural resources?

Jaber focuses on education and outreach. He and his team started by creating education materials and programs using grant funding. They organized workshops and spread the word with the help of Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service county agents.

As GSI became a national trend, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) encouraged it.

“There was this perfect storm, and cities started hearing us,” Jaber said. “We mostly targeted city stormwater departments. They would come to the lecture, hear about it, and then the next day someone would call, and they’re like, ‘There’s a big erosion problem here. Can you help us?’”

From there, the word spread further, supported with educational materials and results from grant-funded projects. Jaber and his team began using computer models to show the impact of GSI. They also held events for master naturalists to invite them to implement GSI in their volunteer projects.

“There are ways to make it simple enough so that people can build it,” he said. “Like, for your backyard, you don’t need an engineer. The idea is just to let it spread and have people want to adopt it.”

Baptiste has taken a similar path, focusing on education and outreach with city staff. According to her, most city staff are eager to learn about GSI and how to implement it. Her advice is to highlight benefits that will appeal to the city.

“When talking to municipal staff, it’s important to highlight the benefits that go beyond simply creating a greener community and supporting the environment,” said Baptiste. “GSI practices can offer the same advantages as gray infrastructure while also providing additional social and economic benefits.”

Social and economic benefits of GSI include:

Human health – Green spaces promote active lifestyles, connect people with their neighbors and provide areas to relax and destress, improving mental health.

Quality of life – GSI can improve water quality, conserve water, enhance air quality, and reduce noise pollution, all of which improve human quality of life.

Improved visual appeal – By incorporating natural elements into urban areas, GSI can create beautiful public spaces.

Community safety – By increasing infiltration, GSI can reduce flood risks, protecting the community.

Reduced costs – GSI can reduce flood damage and wastewater infrastructure costs by increasing infiltration and water reuse.

These AgriLife experts are also helping communities get GSI information by incorporating GSI into grade school and university curriculums, using financial tools to gather funding, implementing coherent and specific guidelines for GSI adoption, and creating regulations for keeping green spaces in new developments, according to Jaber’s research.

The benefits of GSI are plentiful and worthwhile, Baptiste said, improving communities’ safety, social infrastructure and environmental sustainability.

“I wish more people understood that GSI isn’t just about being ‘green,’ it’s about building resilient and healthy communities,” said Baptiste. “It creates spaces that can handle stormwater more naturally while improving quality of life. It can reduce flooding, support local ecosystems, and make neighborhoods more vibrant. GSI can work with existing infrastructure and doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive to make a difference. “

HARDI wrote that it also strongly supports the EPA’s proposal to repeal the installation date compliance requirement for residential and light commercial AC/HP systems.
In addition, Lennox supports EPA’s proposal to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial AC/HP components manufactured before January 1, 2025.
Trane Technologies supports EPA’s plan to eliminate the January 1, 2026, installation compliance date for residential and light commercial AC/HP systems.","Nearly 2,300 comments were submitted before the deadline, and EPA is in the process of reviewing them and then posting them to the public docket. A final decision isn’t expected until sometime in 2026, leaving many HVACR contractors uncertain about what equipment can be legally installed after January 1. Below are some of the concerns raised by HVACR stakeholders.

ACCA asked EPA to remove installation deadlines for residential, light commercial AC/HP and VRF/VRV systems manufactured or imported before January 1, 2025, arguing that the cutoff could strand lawful R-410A equipment, disrupt projects, and impose needless financial risk on contractors and consumers. The association added that eliminating the deadline would not increase the amount of high-GWP equipment produced but would simply allow lawful inventory to be installed until sold. ACCA also warned that differing state refrigerant rules could further complicate the transition and urged EPA to use its authority to discourage a patchwork of state refrigerant regulations.

As Barton James, president and CEO of ACCA, wrote, “In the absence of federal preemption under the AIM Act, several states are pursuing accelerated regulatory timelines that effectively mandate a transition to A3 refrigerants…A3 refrigerants pose materially different installation, ventilation, and ignition-risk challenges than A2Ls, and the rapid transition schedules under consideration in some states would force contractors to navigate incompatible codes, unavailable equipment, and unclear liability exposure.”

AHRI and the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy urged EPA to maintain the existing TT rule schedule, arguing that delaying transition dates or raising GWP limits would undermine years of industry investment, misalign HFC demand with the AIM Act’s tightening supply caps, and lead to higher refrigerant prices for consumers. They emphasized that “multiple substitute refrigerants are listed as approved under EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) [program], and building codes nationwide now allow for their installation,” adding that as of July 2025, nearly 90% of new residential and light commercial AC/HP systems used substitute refrigerants.

The groups warned that broad delays would reward laggards, disadvantage U.S. manufacturers, and trigger a patchwork of rules among the states. The letter stated, “The practical course is clear: keep one national schedule, preserve the 2029 supply-demand alignment, and use narrow, evidence-based relief only where necessary.”

Carrier supported the overall framework of the TT rule but requested several key modifications to ensure a smoother transition. Specifically, the company urged EPA to remove the installation deadline for VRF systems, aligning them with residential and light-commercial AC/HP systems to avoid stranded inventory and simplify compliance. Carrier also asked EPA to stop treating replacement residential and light commercial condensing units as service components under the rule.

“Treating the condenser…as a service component is not needed, nor is it in the best interest of consumers,” wrote Rob Six, head of government relations at Carrier. He noted that Carrier residential HVAC components carry a 10-year warranty, so most R-410A outdoor unit failures are covered. When failures occur after the warranty period, replacing only the outdoor unit can create system mismatches, “leading to inefficient performance and a higher likelihood of additional repairs over the system’s lifespan. Such increased costs for consumers run counter to the intent of the proposed rule.”

Copeland asked EPA to keep the current TT rule timelines, emphasizing that changes would create uncertainty, raise refrigerant costs, and “exacerbate an already complex patchwork of mandates and regulations” at the state level. The company noted that the industry is already moving to lower-GWP refrigerants, pointing to updated building codes, strong A2L adoption in the HVAC market, and a number of viable options for the food retail industry.

“Technologies such as CO₂, ammonia, A2Ls, R-290, and hybrid conﬁgurations each ﬁt different applications, giving [food retailers] ﬂexibility to match solutions with their technology preferences, regional conditions, and budget considerations,” wrote Jennifer Butsch, director of regulatory affairs at Copeland.

Extending HFC use could also strain future refrigerant supply under the AIM Act, she cautioned, which would be detrimental to the industry. “Maintaining the published transition timelines supports the OEMs that have made signiﬁcant investments in these solutions and helps preserve a stable HFC supply–demand balance, which is important for affordability now and in the future.”

Daikin expressed support for EPA’s plan to eliminate the installation deadline for residential and light commercial AC/HP systems built from components produced or imported before January 1, 2025. The company further noted that VRF systems should be granted the same indefinite installation allowance for pre-2026 components to ensure consistency across product categories.

“A uniform installation approach across air conditioners, heat pumps, and VRF would (i) prevent stranded lawful inventory; (ii) reduce the likelihood of potential economic losses borne by U.S. manufacturers, distributors, contractors, and end-users; (iii) align with the structure and rationale of the Technology Transitions program; (iv) eliminate the need for administratively complex permit-based carve-outs; and (v) avoid distorting multi-year commercial project pipelines that depend on predictable installation timelines,” wrote David Calabrese, executive vice president of government aﬀairs at Daikin.

Daikin also asked EPA to offer a time-limited No Action Assurance (NAA) — or similar enforcement flexibility — for equipment categories with January 1, 2026, compliance dates that could change during this reconsideration. Because it will take time to review comments, complete interagency review, and finalize the rule, Calabrese wrote that an NAA would give manufacturers and distributors some much-needed clarity on how existing inventory and pending orders will be handled.

HARDI wrote that it also strongly supports the EPA’s proposal to repeal the installation date compliance requirement for residential and light commercial AC/HP systems. “We urge the EPA to extend this repeal to all HVAC and refrigeration subsectors (e.g., commercial VRF and retail food refrigeration systems) in the ﬁnal rule. This change would eliminate the current rule’s prohibition on installing pre-existing refrigeration/AC/HP equipment after a certain date, meaning compliance for these products would be determined solely by the date of manufacture (or import) of the equipment,” wrote Alex Ayers, vice president of government affairs at HARDI.

That said, HARDI strongly opposes EPA’s proposed “graduated schedule” for retail food refrigeration, supermarkets, and cold storage warehouses, which would add a higher interim GWP limit in 2026/2027 and delay the original low-GWP requirement until 2032. Ayers wrote that this approach would violate AIM Act timing rules, create enforcement “donut holes,” destabilize the market, disadvantage distributors who invested in low-GWP options, and is unnecessary given the availability of compliant technologies.

HARDI also strongly disagrees with the EPA’s position on outdoor condensing units used as replacement components. “Allowing unlimited production of outdoor units for legacy systems could prolong the market for R-410A equipment for decades, undermining the transition to low-GWP refrigerants,” wrote Ayers. “It creates a loophole that allows a homeowner to effectively obtain a new R-410A system even after pre-2025 inventory has been eliminated by replacing the outdoor condensing unit multiple times beyond the system's intended lifespan.”

Lennox asked EPA to maintain the existing timelines and GWP limits in the TT rule for commercial refrigeration equipment in order to avoid a patchwork of state regulations, prevent duplicative costs and stranded assets, minimize consumer impacts, protect U.S. jobs and technological leadership, and avert refrigerant shortages and price spikes. The company also stressed that EPA should finalize the rule as quickly as possible to prevent further weakening of market demand.

In addition, Lennox supports EPA’s proposal to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial AC/HP components manufactured before January 1, 2025. “Lennox also recommends that EPA extend these provisions to VRF systems, providing an indefinite installation for VRF systems assembled entirely from components manufactured or imported before January 1, 2026, consistent with the proposed indefinite allowance for AC/HP systems assembled from pre-2025 components,” wrote Dave Winningham, senior engineering manager of regulatory affairs at Lennox.”

Rheem wrote that it, too, strongly supports EPA’s proposal to remove the deadline for installation of HVAC systems assembled from components manufactured and imported prior to 2025. According to Karen Meyers, vice president of government affairs, “Rheem recommends that the same compliance relief be fairly applied to other field-installed systems, including those for VRF and commercial refrigeration subsectors. There is little need to prematurely cease use of existing equipment when the present and ongoing supply chain dynamics, coupled with a reduction in the supply of refrigerant as brought about by the Allocation Rule, limit the ability for entities in the HVACR market channel to build significant inventory.”

Rheem also urged EPA to swiftly provide No Action Assurance, or other enforcement guidance, to cover the period of time between January 1, 2026, and the effective date of the amended final rule. “Given that it is unlikely for a final rule to clear necessary review and publish prior to the end of the year, the Jan. 1st installation deadline for both air conditioning and refrigeration systems in certain subsectors presents compliance ambiguity…Rheem implores EPA to provide written enforcement guidance prior to Jan 1, 2026, so that affected manufacturers, installers, and end users can have compliance certainty during the remainder of the rulemaking period,” wrote Allison Skidd, director of global regulatory affairs — air at Rheem.

Trane Technologies supports EPA’s plan to eliminate the January 1, 2026, installation compliance date for residential and light commercial AC/HP systems. The company noted that giving distributors the ability to sell existing inventory promotes an orderly transition and avoids wasting usable equipment, while keeping the manufacturing deadlines that advance the shift to lower-GWP refrigerants.

Helen Walter-Terrinoni, director of policy and advocacy at Trane Technologies, added that the company does not support allowing indefinite replacement of condensing units using legacy chemistries, which “incentivizes bad actors to continue importing such refrigerants labeled for service and repair and creates an enforcement issue for the Agency.”

She also urged EPA to issue a time-limited No Action Assurance, or other enforcement relief mechanisms, confirming that the Agency will not pursue enforcement for noncompliance with the January 1, 2026, deadlines until the Reconsideration rule is finalized. “This approach would maintain the EPA’s regulatory integrity while ensuring that the regulated community can operate in good faith without fear of inadvertent noncompliance resulting from administrative timing constraints,” she said.",https://www.achrnews.com/ext/resources/2025/12/09/Lennox-condensing-unit.jpg?height=635&t=1765293964&width=1200,N,,2025-12-10 18:01:42.447347

What Comes Next Electricity costs will continue to evolve as the grid modernizes and power demand grows, but this evolution creates long-term benefits.","Electricity costs are climbing across the U.S., with the EIA(link is external) expecting the nominal U.S. average electricity price to increase by 13% from 2022 to 2025. For customers, rising power bills can feel sudden and unsettling. Headlines often focus on a single culprit, but energy cost challenges are more complex and nuanced than most realize.

In reality, U.S. electricity costs reflect multiple factors: aging infrastructure, extreme weather, industrial growth, and new digital demand driven by AI — each adding strain to a grid built for a different era and increasing competition for a limited amount of assets, equipment, fuel, and water. Addressing these challenges is a shared problem for our sector’s various stakeholders, including utilities, OEMs, and policymakers.

“What’s different now is the convergence of technology, weather, and demand,” says Andrea Willwerth, Manager, Market Intelligence & Strategy, Mitsubishi Power Americas. “The system is being asked to do more than ever before.”

Utilities, IPPs, ISOs, and state leaders are balancing the pressure to deliver reliable, affordable energy while meeting the low-emissions goals of increasingly complex customers. These newer players, including hyperscalers, developers, and data center co-locators, are used to moving fast and scaling even faster, but now must navigate an energy ecosystem shaped by regulation, timelines, and competing priorities.

As the power ecosystem becomes more interconnected, clear communication with the public is even more critical. Today’s consumers expect transparency from the brands they trust, and power providers are no exception. That means explaining why prices are changing, what’s being done to manage them, and how strategic investments in a rapidly evolving power market now prevent higher costs later. That kind of transparency builds trust, strengthens credibility, and encourages smarter energy use, which ultimately supports affordability.

For many, electricity has been taken for granted. Power runs until it doesn’t. And because the grid is largely invisible, the need for modernization isn’t always obvious. By clearly communicating grid modernization as an investment into long-term efficiency and resilience, the energy sector can help consumers understand the forces behind rising costs and why upgrades matter. That’s the story our sector has a responsibility to tell.

What Are the Hidden Factors Driving Electricity Cost Trends?

Most consumers don’t realize how old the U.S. power system is or the impact that aging infrastructure has. An S&P Global(link is external) analysis shows the capacity-weighted average age of the generation fleet is approximately 28 years, and many coal-fired power plants are now 40–60 years old. Upgrades and replacements require major, long-term capital investments, costs that inevitably ripple into rates.

We expect regular updates for our cars, smart homes, hospitals, and classrooms because technology evolves and demands change. The grid is no different. While utilities are investing in their fleets, the broader grid lags behind the pace of innovation seen in other sectors. Transmission and distribution upgrades are underway, but according to a 2025 DOE report(link is external) on U.S. grid reliability, “The magnitude and speed of projected load growth cannot be met with existing approaches to load addition and grid management.” When the grid is inefficient for today’s needs, consumers feel the cost, as essential upgrades are needed to keep the lights on.

Extreme weather is also driving up costs. Across major U.S. cities, the frequency of heat waves has tripled since the 1960s, according to the EPA. The EIA(link is external) reports 42% of U.S. households now heat primarily with electricity, up from 35% in 2010. Rising temperatures are forcing utilities to add new capacity, reinforce assets, and increase reserve margins (extra generating capacity kept on standby for reliability), all of which raise near-term costs.

Electrification adds another layer of complexity. As homes, vehicles, and manufacturing transition to electric power, the U.S. is experiencing its fastest demand growth in decades. This growth is contributing to higher base and peak loads. Bank of America Institute(link is external) projects U.S. electricity demand to grow at a 2.5% compound annual growth rate through 2035. Higher loads mean utilities need to increase spending on new lines and substations, costs that get passed on to consumers.

Industrial growth and U.S. reshoring are also adding pressure to the grid, and the EIA(link is external) projects that the industrial sector alone will grow at 2.1% annually between 2020 and 2026. The American Clean Power Association(link is external) says that new industrial load growth is disproportionately higher in markets like PJM (Mid-Atlantic and Midwest) and ERCOT (Texas), signaling where regional manufacturing is expanding rapidly. Reshored factories and new manufacturing plants are creating concentrated, location-specific demand growth, which challenges traditional grid planning and may require local infrastructure upgrades.

Of all the forces reshaping power demand, the digital boom may be the most visible to consumers. The IEA Energy and AI special report(link is external) projects that data centers will account for almost half of U.S. electricity demand growth through 2030. These centers power everything from ChatGPT and Google Gemini to cloud computing and other digital services, and McKinsey(link is external) estimates their electricity use will rise by about 25% annually through the decade. “Data centers are a growing part of the picture, but not the whole picture,” says Willwerth. “They’re part of a much larger convergence of forces driving load growth.”

The takeaway: No single factor is driving electricity costs. It’s imperative that we help the public understand that while these factors combined may raise bills, they also improve power generation efficiency and fund the transition to a stronger, more reliable grid that can ultimately stabilize or reduce costs in the long run.

Utilities Are Managing the Pressure with Grid Modernization, Capacity Addition, and Rate Design

Utilities’ energy strategies are adapting to maintain reliability and affordability amid accelerated demand growth. That effort requires investment and open communication with customers and regulators about why those investments matter.

Across the U.S., utilities are investing heavily in grid modernization. Digital grid monitoring, substation automation, and advanced transmission systems are reducing energy losses and outage risk while helping operators respond faster to changing loads. Together, these technologies enhance grid performance and responsiveness, helping keep energy costs in check.

At the same time, utilities are adding capacity and replacing aging units with flexible, efficient generation. Many are deploying hybrid systems that blend natural gas, renewables, and energy storage to manage peaks cost-effectively while lowering emissions.

So all of these factors – electrification, manufacturing, modernization – are influencing prices. But perhaps the most significant factor in determining what the end-user sees on their power bill each month is actually rate design, which is being influenced by data centers (though not in the way you might think). Let’s start at the beginning. A regulator’s central concern is that data center electricity cost is getting passed on to residential users. Historically, the contracts have been drafted out and executed where this would be the case. However, rate contracts are changing greatly as a response to hyperscalers and others coming online and demanding more power. These contracts, fittingly, are called large load contracts, and they are structured in distinctly different ways than traditional rate designs.

Generally speaking, large load contracts have three central qualities:

1. Structured in 15-20 year contracts

2. Utilize a ""take or pay"" clause

3. Leverage a ""cancellation fee""

For example, in Ohio and Michigan, utilities have worked with state regulators to introduce new requirements like take-or-pay provisions, requiring large-load customers such as hyperscalers to pay for roughly 80 to 85% of contracted capacity, regardless of usage. Some state mechanisms also include exit fees and collateral requirements to prevent stranded assets. The reforms aim to spread costs equitably across industrial and residential customers, and these structures are being increasingly adopted as more projects become real.

These contract structures are all part of the power sector evolving to meet the needs of customers and off-takers. “Utilities and hyperscalers are adapting,” says Xiufang Gao, Senior Director, Market Intelligence & Strategy, Mitsubishi Power. “States and regulators are interested in imposing cost-recovery mechanisms, so residents are not overburdened.”

The industry’s challenge now is to make these efforts visible and show how they benefit everyday consumers.

Original Equipment Manufacturers Innovation in Power Generation

Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) have a limited, but vital, role in cost containment. Although equipment typically represents only a limited percentage of the capital costs of a power plant, according to a visualization from Brattle(link is external), OEM energy solutions deliver efficiency, flexibility, and integration that support cost-effective power generation for decades.

Mitsubishi Power’s high-efficiency gas turbines and hydrogen-ready turbines improve fuel performance, lowering cost and emissions. These turbines bring more electrons to the grid today, while advancing toward the technologies of tomorrow. Through frame agreements and standardized designs, the company helps utilities shorten project timelines and manage costs. Digital tools like predictive maintenance, remote diagnostics, and advanced control systems help operators maintain top performance and extend asset life.

“We cannot control the macroeconomics, but we can help our customers control what’s in their hands,” says Gao.

Collaboration Is the Real Solution

The future of energy pricing is a shared design problem and an educational opportunity. Partnerships between utilities, data centers, OEMs, EPCs, and regulators are reshaping the cost and capacity conversation. Despite their differences, they share risk and a common goal: safe, affordable, reliable energy with a path toward lowering emissions.

Initiatives like DCFlex(link is external) explore how data center backup power is being integrated into the grid’s reserve margin, reducing the need for new peaking units. Tech companies like Google are experimenting with workload shifting to reduce computational demand during grid peaks.

“Regulators and hyperscalers are from completely different worlds,” says Willwerth. “But now, you probably can’t go to a power conference without hearing about data centers, and you can't go to a data center conference without hearing about power. They know they need each other, and they're really trying to understand each other and find common ground.”

These collaborations represent a new kind of progress where innovation is as much about partnership as it is about technology.

What Comes Next

Electricity costs will continue to evolve as the grid modernizes and power demand grows, but this evolution creates long-term benefits. Efficiency improvements and hybrid systems can help offset rising fuel and construction costs, while new rate structures and contract terms can balance fairness and flexibility across different types of customers. Early pilots are already producing blueprints for scalable solutions, showing that reliability and affordability can advance together.

By helping the public understand what’s being built, upgraded, and secured, we’re showing consumers the real value behind their electricity bills before misconceptions take hold.

The collaboration will produce 2 new Ford-branded EVs built on Renault's Ampere platform, expected to launch in early 2028.

The automakers have also signed a letter of intent to explore jointly developing and manufacturing light commercial vehicles.

Ford Motor Co. entered into a ""strategic partnership"" with French-automaker Renault Group to expand Ford’s electric vehicle offering in Europe, a deal that will ""significantly"" improve the competitiveness for both companies in Europe, the companies said Dec. 9 in a statement.

The collaboration, which is not a joint-venture, will involve the automakers developing two distinct Ford-branded EVs, Ford's statement said.

Additionally, the two auto companies have signed a Letter of Intent for a European light commercial vehicle collaboration. Under this letter, the companies ""will explore the opportunity to jointly develop and manufacture"" certain Ford and Renault light commercial vehicles, Ford said in a statement.

The two new EVs will be based on the Ampere platform — that's Renault's EV arm dedicated to designing advanced and affordable EVs. For Ford, the partnership means leveraging Renault's EV assets and competitiveness. The vehicles will be made by Renault Group in the north of France using Ampere’s ElectriCity’s “state-of-the-art” manufacturing expertise.

For Renault, the two vehicles, which are expected to come to market in early 2028, will be designed by Ford. The EVs will feature ""distinctive driving dynamics, authentic Ford-brand DNA and intuitive experiences"" and mark the first step in a new product offensive for Ford in Europe.

“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. “How we compete here, how we innovate, partner, and invest — will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”

Ford and Renault take on the Chinese

Farley added that the partnership is an important step for Ford and supports ""our strategy to build a highly efficient and fit-for-the future business in Europe. We will combine Renault Group’s industrial scale and EV assets with Ford’s iconic design and driving dynamics to create vehicles that are fun, capable and distinctly Ford in spirit.""

Farley has been vocal about the importance of being competitive in EVs against Chinese manufacturers, which are known for making high-quality and affordable EVs, and have a growing footprint in Europe with major Chinese brands such as BYD and Geely gaining marketshare.

According to Schmidt Automotive Research, the marketshare for Chinese EVs in Western Europe is expected to increase to 11% this year or 269,450 vehicles, up from 9.6% in 2024. Western Europe includes Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain. That's a gigantic gain in marketshare given that in 2021 the Chinese EV companies had just 3.8% marketshare. But the research forecasts that Chinese EV marketshare will peak at 13% in 2028 then slide back to 11.7% in 2030 or 756,000 vehicles.

Currently, EVs represent a total of 16.1% of vehicles sold in Europe, Ford said, far below the required 25% of new vehicle registrations required to meet Europe’s strict CO2 targets by 2025.

“We need to enable everyone to benefit from electrification and letting customers choose — whether that’s fully electric or hybrid vehicles,” Ford Europe President Jim Baumbick said in a statement. “It is about making the transition more attractive and more affordable for all consumers and businesses, stimulating demand rather than stifling it.”

Ford and Renault leaders say that by joining forces in innovation, design, software and service delivery, will help them to address industry challenges and better serve retail and commercial customers.

“Our plan is about unleashing the Blue Oval,” Baumbick said. “We are leveraging strategic partnerships to ensure competitiveness, but we are obsessing over the product. These will be fun-to-drive, fully connected vehicles that stand out from the crowd.”

The gains from the partnership

When asked how much cost-savings and efficiency Ford hopes to gain from this partnership or how much revenue it forecasts coming from sales of these new EVs once they come to market, Ford Europe spokesman Dirk Ellenbeck told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network: ""The partnership combines the expertise, industrial scale and supply base of Ford and the Renault Group and will improve the competitiveness of both parties. We are not disclosing financials associated with this partnership.""

But the partnership combines the expertise, industrial scale and supply base of two major companies to deliver efficiency and manufacturing scale.

François Provost, CEO Renault Group, said the collaboration reflects the strength of both companies' expertise and competitiveness in Europe.

""In the long term, combining our strengths with Ford will make us more innovative and more responsive in a fast-changing European automotive market,"" Provost said in a statement.

Ford's other partners

Ford has existing partnerships in Europe. Ford Otosan is its joint venture with Koç Holding, a Turkish investment company. That arrangement has helped support Ford's commercial vehicle business in Europe. Ford Otosan plants are supplied with electric drive units produced in the United Kingdom following a £380 million investment in the plant, and advanced engine technology from Ford’s Dagenham plant in England.

In 2020, Ford and Volkswagen AG agreed to develop commercial vehicles and a variety of passenger cars globally. Ford said the partnership is delivering ""significant contributions to strengthening both our commercial vehicle and passenger car businesses. Ford’s current range of electric vehicles from the alliance are produced at its new Electric Vehicle Centre in Cologne, Germany.""

At the same time, Ford is evolving its industrial operations in Europe to help it offer customers more choices for ""multienergy vehicles."" Ford’s plant in Valencia, Spain, will continue to play a critical role in realizing Ford’s plan for an enhanced passenger vehicle portfolio in Europe, the company said.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/08/PDTF/87673924007-ford-ev.JPG?crop=6719,3781,x0,y349&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 14:01:22.245437

It became the first group to use non-violent methods to oppose nuclear weapons testing, frequently by attempting to enter or entering closed-off nuclear weapons testing sites.
The Sierra Club describes itself as being “unequivocally opposed to nuclear energy.” In its statement on nuclear energy, the Sierra Club points to nuclear safety, nuclear proliferation, and the long-term storage of nuclear waste as making “nuclear power a uniquely dangerous energy technology for humanity.”[11] Greenpeace’s statement on nuclear energy asserts that nuclear “has no place in a safe, clean, sustainable future.” The organization describes nuclear energy as both expensive and dangerous and asserts that “just because nuclear pollution is invisible doesn’t mean it’s clean.”[12] In another example, Friends of the Earth describes nuclear as a “slow and costly solution to the climate crisis” and “one that creates harmful waste we have no answer for.”[13] Nuclear professional and industry organizations—the American Nuclear Society, the Nuclear Energy Institute, the Electric Power Research Institute, and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, for example—have long favored the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Ultimately, the polarizing debate around nuclear energy is obscuring a simple fact: Our shared energy future is uncertain.","Nearly 15 years after Fukushima, proponents and critics of nuclear energy remain deeply divided about the accident’s seriousness and nuclear energy more broadly.

On March 11, 2011, an earthquake exceeding 9 on the Richter scale struck just off the East Coast of Japan. The earthquake caused a tsunami whose waves rose over 40 meters at their highest point and over 15 meters at the site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, where they surged over the 10-meter-tall seawall, flooding the emergency diesel generators that were the main source of backup power for the plant, which had already lost connection to the electricity grid. Although the plant shut down, the fuel in the reactors continued to produce decay heat, gradually evaporating the water in which the fuel was initially submerged. This cooling water continued to boil and evaporate until the fuel itself became uncovered and began to melt.

Three of the reactors at the site experienced partial meltdowns (units 1, 2, and 3). Hydrogen generated by the overheated fuel ignited, causing explosions in three reactor buildings (units 1, 3, and 4) and widespread dispersion of radioactivity. It took three months of tireless effort before the plant staff could restore automatic cooling to the damaged units and another six months before the reactors were declared stable and in a state of “cold shutdown.” The makeshift arrangements needed to restore the reactors to a stable condition generated over 350 million gallons of contaminated water, now being filtered, diluted, and released into the Pacific Ocean. The radionuclides released during the reactor building explosions still contaminate the soil and air in the towns closest to the Fukushima Daiichi plant, and the decontamination work is ongoing.

Over 150,000 people were evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture in 2011. The latest estimates from November 2024 indicate that over 24,000 evacuees are still displaced, having resettled outside the area.

Many proponents of nuclear energy describe the events that unfolded at the Fukushima Daiichi plant as an extremely low-probability “accident” or, more specifically, a “beyond design basis accident” caused by a series of highly improbable events beyond human control. These proponents also describe the accident’s aftermath as a success story because it did not lead to any immediate radiation-related deaths. But for critics of nuclear energy, however, the very name of the Fukushima prefecture has become synonymous with disaster—a disaster they view as not at all unexpected, with many describing it as a “normal accident,”[1] meaning that it was inevitable (Perrow 2011).

Nuclear proponents use the Fukushima experience as evidence of why nuclear energy should not just continue to be used, but be used on a much larger scale, if the worst possible outcome is a Fukushima-like accident. Critics view the Fukushima disaster as a complete indictment of nuclear energy—calling not only for a halt to new reactor projects but also for shuttering existing reactors. Both sides, though seemingly drawing on the same set of facts, interpret them quite differently to reach their conclusions, with neither side offering a full picture.

Since its inception, discussion about nuclear energy has been marked by extreme polarization, with proponents and opponents seeming to inhabit separate worlds when making wildly different claims about the future of nuclear energy. In making these claims, proponents and opponents do not engage with one another, hoping to learn; rather, they try to evangelize, seeking to convince the other side of what they view as universal truths about nuclear energy.

These claims to absolute truth frequently rely on emotion, apocalyptic imagery, rigid logic, and separation of connected facts (what we call “rhetorical fission”) or connection of fragmented facts (what we call “rhetorical fusion”). Those claims are often divorced from the lived experiences—positive and negative—of people affected by nuclear power, whether through the benefits of greater access to reliable electricity and reductions in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions or, on the negative side, through accidents at power plants, the mining of uranium, and the storage of used nuclear fuel.

Here, we argue for a different way of discussing the many issues around the use of nuclear energy to provide electrical power, one that moves beyond rhetorical fission and fusion and acknowledges uncertainty and the place-based nature of the issue. This model asks proponents and opponents to think beyond their identities as advocates and bring previously unheard voices and forms of evidence to a deliberative co-creation of planetary futures.

How the nuclear debate arose

In the United States, the anti-nuclear movement began in the 1950s in response to the testing of nuclear weapons. The United States carried out 1,054 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1992, with 210 of these being atmospheric tests.[2] Anti-nuclear protests intensified with an increase in atmospheric weapons tests, particularly after those in the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands led to fallout and widespread but unacknowledged health impacts for local communities.[3]

The Committee for Nonviolent Action (CNVA) was formed in 1957 in response to the US program of nuclear weapons testing. It became the first group to use non-violent methods to oppose nuclear weapons testing, frequently by attempting to enter or entering closed-off nuclear weapons testing sites. In 1957 members attempted to enter the Camp Mercury nuclear testing area near Las Vegas and made another attempt to enter the Eniwetok Proving Grounds in the Marshall Islands in 1958. Years later, CNVA’s attempts to enter these closed-off weapons testing sites would inspire Greenpeace protests.

Members of Greenpeace (who initially called themselves the “Don’t make a wave committee”) sailed to Alaska (on a ship called Greenpeace) in 1971 to stop a second nuclear weapons test on Amchitka Island.[4] Greenpeace’s activism against nuclear weapons testing spread to other countries as well. In France, Greenpeace activist David McTaggart played a central role in halting French nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific. Greenpeace’s activism, which began with a focus on nuclear weapons, shifted to also focus on the dumping of radioactive waste when, in 1993, a Greenpeace ship documented a Russian navy vessel dumping radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan, in violation of the London Convention, an international treaty created to control ocean dumping (McCullagh 1995).

In 1961, a group known as the Women’s Strike for Peace mobilized roughly 50,000 women to march in protest against nuclear weapons in over 60 US cities. This organization began tying nuclear weapons issues to the health and lived experiences of everyday people. They used slogans such as “End the Arms Race—Not the Human Race” and “Pure Milk, Not Poison.”[5] As an organization composed primarily of mothers, the Women’s Strike for Peace was particularly concerned about the health impacts of weapons testing on children. This strategy of connecting anti-nuclear weapons arguments with everyday health and safety issues is one that would hold sway across organizations for some time.

By the 1960s, the nuclear power industry had begun to take off. Light water reactors had emerged as the leading design for the United States, and reactor designers and electric utilities were scaling initial designs for plants capable of generating hundreds of megawatts of electricity. Over this same period, environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club began to raise concerns about nuclear energy.

Although initially pro-nuclear energy, the Sierra Club began to oppose to nuclear energy in the late 1950s, specifically in the form of the Bodega Head nuclear power plant planned by Pacific Gas and Electric for a coastal site in Northern California. This project was ultimately stopped as a result of the club’s opposition and grassroots efforts that cited concerns about the proposed plant’s proximity to the San Andreas fault. At that point, the Sierra Club did not express a blanket disapproval of nuclear power, and the group otherwise supported the use of nuclear energy. But a second nuclear plant project, Diablo Canyon on California’s central coast, which ultimately was built, divided the club, with many, including then-executive director David Brower, believing that the Sierra Club needed to take a more radical stance against nuclear energy (Wellock 1992). (The Club officially adopted an anti-nuclear energy stance in 1974 and extended that stance to include opposition to fusion energy in 1986, though it appears that its stance on fusion is now undergoing reversal).[6]

In 1969, Brower, facing opposition from the Club’s board, left to start a new organization, the Friends of the Earth, which, since its inception, framed opposition to nuclear energy as central to its mission—a stance that continues now. Since its founding, the organization has led campaigns to shut down existing reactors and prevent the construction of new ones. In so doing, it combined lobbying, public education, and direct action to great effect.

Public education efforts initiated by anti-nuclear organizations shared a common feature with similar efforts launched by nuclear proponents: Both assumed a naive public that lacked knowledge about nuclear power, and, with few exceptions, they made universal arguments, framing their stances on nuclear energy as the only possible answer for the technology’s future. See figure 1 below.

By the 1970s, US environmental groups began calling for a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction, with regional groups such as the SHAD (Sound-Hudson Against Atomic Development) Alliance, gathering widespread support in the aftermath of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. SHAD succeeded in shuttering the Shoreham, New York, nuclear power plant before it even began operation.[7]

Though these efforts did not lead to a nationwide ban on nuclear energy, many states adopted moratoria on building nuclear plants, instituting conditions restricting new nuclear plant construction. California’s 1976 moratorium on nuclear energy, for example, curtailed new nuclear construction until a federal plan for nuclear waste disposal was created. Moratoria passed by Kentucky (1984), Wisconsin (1983), and Illinois (1987) all cited the absence of a federal nuclear waste management plan. Notably, all three states have fully or partially repealed their moratoria to allow new nuclear plant construction, with Illinois’s partial repeal specifically allowing for the construction of advanced and small modular reactors. As of this writing, nine states in the United States still have moratoria on new nuclear energy construction.[8]

Though having US origins, many environmental and anti-nuclear groups had significant influence in other countries. In 1976, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, and 20 other environmental groups came together to form the “Campaign for a Non-Nuclear Future,” which had a goal of opposing the development of nuclear power in New Zealand and promoting the use of renewable energy.

Another organization central to the nuclear debate is the Union of Concerned Scientists. Founded in 1969 by faculty and students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the organization combined scientific expertise, activism, and environmentalism. Its founders called for scientific research to be used for environmental preservation, and not the development of military technologies—including nuclear weapons.[9] The UCS would soon also play a role in a key debate about nuclear power.

In many countries, anti-nuclear power movements began as local protests against specific facilities and grew to become national in scope, gaining momentum in the aftermath of the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents. In Germany, the anti-nuclear movement began in the 1970s with the opposition to a nuclear power project in the town of Wyhl (Glaser 2012). In France, large-scale protests began in 1971 against plans for the first light-water reactor at Bugey (Tompkins 2016).[10] In Australia, too, protests began in the 1970s against both uranium mining and the proposed Jervis Bay nuclear power plant (Candela 2017). In many European countries, these local movements gained the support of national environmental groups and helped shaped energy policy. These movements led to decisions to phase out nuclear power in Italy, Sweden, Belgium, and Spain. (The implementations of these phase-out plans have varied, and Belgium and Sweden recently reversed their national nuclear phase-out stances.) In the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima accident, Germany embarked on a plan to shutter all of its nuclear power plants.

Over this period of growing opposition, the nuclear industry found some unlikely allies. Inspired by the Atoms for Peace program, astrophysicist Heinz Haber authored “Our Friend the Atom” in 1956. The book, on the benefits of nuclear power, was illustrated by works from more than 20 illustrators from Walt Disney Studios. (Haber was a science consultant to the studios’ founder, Walt Disney). It was also part of a nearly hour-long episode of the television series Disneyland. The book and the episode were an effort to rehabilitate the atom, following the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the ongoing campaigns against nuclear weapons testing. In his writing, Haber acknowledged that the atom had become a “superb villain” but noted also that the power of the atom could be harnessed “for the welfare of all mankind” (Haber 1957). See Figure 2.

The book concluded with three chapters describing the three wishes the atom would grant humanity: power, food and health, and peace. Haber’s book and the Disneyland episode presented a utopian, inevitable vision for nuclear energy, without admitting to the realistic challenges of scaling up nuclear power as an energy source. See Figure 3 below.

In its efforts to promote nuclear power, the nuclear industry looked to researchers for guidance on how to engage with the public. In the late 1960s, emerging research on risk perception asserted that publics were seldom “rational” when weighing the risks of various technologies. Instead, studies found, public perception of risk is largely driven by emotion. The research showed that publics were willing to take on higher levels of risk for voluntary rather than involuntary activities, and that feelings of dread and lack of control heightened sensitivity to risks, leading individuals to focus on a bad outcome instead of the probability that it might occur—a probability that might be vanishingly small (Slovic 2016). One branch of research, led by noted physicist and nuclear expert Chauncey Starr, was rooted in what we know now as the “deficit model,” which suggested that the public’s perception of the riskiness of a technology was rooted in a deficit of knowledge.

Starr suggested that public perceptions of risk could be mediated and managed through better education and advertising (Starr 1969). The nuclear industry ran with these findings, launching campaigns to educate the public about nuclear power. This mode of engagement with the public became the norm and persisted for decades. Arguably, it persists today. In the 1980s, in the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident, several energy utilities banded together to form the US Council for Energy Awareness. In its advertisements, the council, in an effort to win public approval, tied nuclear energy to another salient issue—dependence on foreign oil. See figure 4 below.

Although the proponents and opponents of nuclear energy created separate discourses, seldom admitting to each other’s existence, there is at least one instance of a collaboration between the two that unequivocally led to public good by improving both the design and governance of nuclear energy technologies. In 1972, the US Atomic Energy Commission convened hearings on the design of emergency core cooling systems—a vital safeguard in nuclear reactors. The hearings had been convened following controversy over the AEC’s safety standards. The AEC had been designed with dual conflicting missions—to both regulate and promote nuclear energy. The hearings revealed that these conflicting missions had left the AEC fundamentally compromised, with the developmental arm slowing down or defunding the work of the regulatory arm.

Leading up to and during the two-year period of the hearings, AEC insiders collaborated with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) to uncover suppressed information. The UCS representatives at the hearings, Daniel Ford (an economist) and Myron Cherry (a lawyer) had no formal technical training but were coached by AEC dissenters and nuclear researchers from AEC laboratories. These dissenters supplied suppressed documents and helped the UCS’ representatives prepare their arguments concerning the flawed designs and simulations of emergency core cooling systems.

The hearings ultimately led to the collapse of the AEC and the creation of separate regulatory and developmental agencies. It also led to new safety standards for emergency core cooling systems, which were vital in light of the ongoing scale-up of nuclear energy (Wellock 2012). None of this would have been possible without collaboration across the “anti” and “pro” nuclear camps. Unfortunately, this collaboration marked but a brief détente. But perhaps this unlikely partnership between the AEC dissenters and the UCS activists presents a model of collaboration that we can repurpose for the present.

What the pro- and anti-nuclear debate looks like now

The rhetorical strategies applied by the anti- and pro-nuclear camps exhibit notable similarities. Nuclear opponents, starting with nuclear weapons activists, tended to vilify pro-nuclear individuals and organizations and frame anti-nuclear activists as “moral agents” and defenders of the environment and public health (Blain 1991). The nuclear proponents, on the other hand, have framed and continue to frame narratives of “nuclear necessity and inevitability” (Kinsella 2015). often linking nuclear energy to issues—such as fighting climate change, providing energy access and security, and more recently, powering AI—on which there is more widespread agreement. See Figure 4, above.

Across this history and the recent past, examples of polarized discourse tend to fall into five categories: emotion-driven arguments, apocalyptic imagery, rigid logic, separation of connected facts (rhetorical fission), or strategic combination of nuclear with more palatable issues (rhetorical fusion).

We use the term “rhetorical fission” to refer to arguments in which ideas that are not logically separable are disconnected to advance an argument. For example, claiming that the Fukushima accident is a story of success because there were no radiation-related deaths separates the many disastrous outcomes of the accident from a single fact about radiation. While technically correct, the argument paints an incomplete picture of the event and, to many people, rings untrue. Rhetorical fusion, on the other hand, combines nuclear arguments with other issues as a way to gain public acceptance. For example, advancing an anti-nuclear argument by associating energy with weapons. The argument is a misdirect in regard to the United States, where civilian nuclear power and the military nuclear arsenal have long been explicitly disassociated from one another.

Emotional and apocalyptic arguments tend to emerge from anti-nuclear organizations. The Sierra Club describes itself as being “unequivocally opposed to nuclear energy.” In its statement on nuclear energy, the Sierra Club points to nuclear safety, nuclear proliferation, and the long-term storage of nuclear waste as making “nuclear power a uniquely dangerous energy technology for humanity.”[11] Greenpeace’s statement on nuclear energy asserts that nuclear “has no place in a safe, clean, sustainable future.” The organization describes nuclear energy as both expensive and dangerous and asserts that “just because nuclear pollution is invisible doesn’t mean it’s clean.”[12] In another example, Friends of the Earth describes nuclear as a “slow and costly solution to the climate crisis” and “one that creates harmful waste we have no answer for.”[13]

Nuclear professional and industry organizations—the American Nuclear Society, the Nuclear Energy Institute, the Electric Power Research Institute, and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, for example—have long favored the peaceful use of nuclear energy. But recently a newer group of pro-nuclear individuals and organizations not populated by nuclear engineers and industry professionals has emerged. These groups view their support for nuclear energy as central to their identity. And here we see instances of rhetorical fusion, pulling identity politics into nuclear arguments. For example, Mothers for Nuclear, founded in 2016, says that after “many years of questioning and working at California’s last remaining nuclear plant,” the group’s members changed their mind about nuclear and now “support nuclear as our largest and most hopeful source of clean energy, vital to addressing some of our world’s biggest challenges: climate change, air pollution, and energy poverty.”[14] The Breakthrough Institute asserts that advanced nuclear technologies promise “clean, reliable power with strong safety profiles and increasing benefits for energy security, climate, and economic development,” while noting that these benefits “require[s] a regulatory system that is equipped to license modern technologies at scale, and overcoming commercial hurdles.”[15]

More recent pro-nuclear advocacy showcases an amalgam of appeals, combining pieces of nuclear stories with bits of pop culture and science to create persuasive nuclear narratives. Pro-nuclear individuals—self-styled and even described by others as “nuclear influencers”—have gone viral on Instagram and TikTok for their accessible commentary on nuclear energy. One such nuclear influencer, Isabelle Boemeke, describes her work as being “at the intersection of art, science, and activism” and “inspiring humans to solve the world’s problems with optimism.” She created her Isodope persona to “advocate for nuclear electricity as a solution to climate change and energy inequality.”[16] A number of other nuclear influencers who identify as millennials and Gen-Zers have also risen to prominence.

Both proponents and opponents have attempted to find a place in the zeitgeist through film. Two recent examples include the Atomic Bamboozle (a 2023 short anti-nuclear film that was showcased as part of the Sierra Club’s Nuclear-Free film series) and Nuclear Now (a 2022 pro-nuclear documentary film that was screened at several university campuses across the US). See figure at top of page.

Both sides imply that their arguments are meant to be universal. For the anti-nuclear organizations, there is no conceivable time or place in which nuclear energy is desirable. For pro-nuclear proponents and influencers, a world without nuclear energy is inconceivable.

What is notably missing from this debate are the voices of people without a public microphone—and those not ideologically aligned with either debate.

Changing the terms of debate for a better nuclear future

Nuclear debate needs to change, and we propose a strategy that can be applied by those on both sides of the issue. We advocate bringing new voices into the conversation and putting opposing points of view in conversation with one another. Specifically, we propose strategic and widespread community engagement as one way to shift the debate away from the absolutism, high drama, and other unsuccessful strategies described above. We acknowledge that community engagement is not new in nuclear contexts, but neither is it the norm, and to date it has almost always been initiated by experts seeking approval for a nuclear project.

For many years, the nuclear industry has operated on the decide-announce-defend model for siting new facilities. Of course, this approach has been met with much opposition, project delays—and in some well-known cases, like Yucca’s Mountain waste repository, complete rejection. This approach to finding a nuclear waste repository has been largely replaced with consent-based siting, although some argue that securing consent is not enough. Particularly in the fusion energy community, the focus has shifted to securing social license (Hoedl 2022), or ongoing public acceptance, for a project in a given context. Social license is largely established by creating trusted pathways for two-way communication between communities and experts, including opportunities to learn from one another. These are valuable strategies, but, importantly, this model still operates under a rubric of persuasion—experts trying to persuade non-experts to accept and maintain a nuclear energy project.

We are arguing for community engagement as a strategy for listening and learning without intent to persuade. These engagements would be purposely not centered on or initiated because of a proposed facility or siting. Instead, they would focus on co-learning activities, where experts from either side of the nuclear debate share information about nuclear energy, and community members share stories about their community. Nuclear proponents and opponents alike could create “listening committees” in their organizations to build trust, establish communication, and even empower communities to invite nuclear projects into their region, instead of the other way around. Alternatively, communities uninterested in nuclear infrastructure reach such a stance through internal deliberation and make it known to developers. This process can support local decision-making, instead of the current situation, in which context and nuance are sacrificed in efforts to win the debate and decisions become transformed into national movements—as has been the case for both anti- and pro-nuclear efforts.

In our research and teaching on community engagement, we have also found that collaborative “futuring” activities—that is, prompts that invite people to imagine desirable future scenarios—can be a powerful way to unpack differences in perspective and find common ground (Verma, Snyder & Daly 2024). When such a strategy is included in community engagements, we have seen people on both sides of the nuclear debate change their minds and open their minds to ideas they never expected to entertain. We know from history that finding common ground is possible even across the most contentious issues. The unlikely collaboration between the AEC dissenters and the UCS activists described above is one example; we are proposing a model to invite more collaborations in this vein and resolve our long-standing differences for a shared common good.

At the same time, community engagement can give voice to people who have lived with nuclear energy and its impacts, for better and for worse, and those insights may help shift us away from the current, polarizing debate. Residents of Fukushima, Japan, for example, have valuable insight into the real-life risk and opportunity of nuclear power. In our experience in Japan this summer, local residents shared nuanced and unexpected perspectives about living through and beyond the Fukushima Daiichi accident. In many cases, residents expressed gratitude for the power provided by the reactor and for the lessons learned by way of the accident. And while solar panels and wind turbines have replaced nuclear in this area, some hope nuclear energy will return. Other people were, of course, not supportive of nuclear, having witnessed mass displacement, loss of loved ones, and an ongoing decontamination effort with no end in sight. But even those who were not supportive were not waging unreasoned arguments against nuclear energy. At the end of our conversations, community members across perspectives shared an outdoor picnic, knowing that Fukushima’s energy future is uncertain, but also that community perspectives are part of the decision-making conversation.

We acknowledge that many organizations may disregard our proposal on the basis of time, cost, or efficiency. Ultimately, the polarizing debate around nuclear energy is obscuring a simple fact: Our shared energy future is uncertain. Arguing more loudly or aggressively is not going to change that situation. A willingness to bring in new perspectives, consider opposing ideas, and embrace uncertainty may be the fastest way toward the clean, safe energy future we all envision.

The auction, which ended with $279.4 million in high bids, was the first of 30 ‍mandated by U.S. President Donald Trump's ​tax cut and spending bill, which he signed into law in July.

His administration's plans for offshore ​leasing are a ⁠significant departure from that of his predecessor, President Joe Biden, which had planned for a historically small number of oil and gas auctions as part of an effort to move away from fossil fuels and address climate change.

""We're entering a new era of offshore American energy dominance,"" Matt Giacona, ‌acting director of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said at the start of ​the ‌auction, which was broadcast online.

BOEM ‍said 30 companies ⁠submitted a total of 219 bids on 1.02 million acres, about 1.3% of the acreage offered.

BP was the most frequent bidder, according to sale documents, followed by Chevron and Shell. Other top bidders included Anadarko, LLOG Exploration Offshore, Talos Energy and Murphy Exploration & Production.

The auction's highest bid was nearly $18.6 million, from Chevron, for a block in the Keithley Canyon deepwater area. The second highest was a joint bid of $15.2 million from Woodside ​Energy Deepwater and Repsol for a block in the Walker Ridge area.

BOEM, an arm of the Interior Department, offered 81.2 million acres in the Gulf at a royalty rate of 12.5%, the lowest permitted by Trump's new tax law. Previously, as mandated by Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, oil companies were required to pay a minimum of 16.66% in royalties to the U.S. Treasury, states and other federal funds.

Trump's law lowered the rate to encourage industry participation in lease sales. U.S. crude oil prices are down about 20% this year, which can limit investment by drillers, though technological innovations in deep-sea drilling are ​expected to help boost Gulf production.

Offshore production accounts for about 15% of U.S. output, but has lagged onshore shale fields in recent years because of longer timelines and higher upfront costs.

The last Gulf sale in 2023 attracted 352 bids by 26 companies covering 1.73 ​million acres. It raised $382 million, the highest of any federal offshore lease sale since 2015.

This work is part of a larger story—one we celebrated at our recent Legacy Luncheon, themed “Where Community Meets the Current.” As we reflected with donors, supporters, and friends, the impact we make along the river is only possible because our community shows up again and again to move this work forward.

Every dollar raised through events like the Legacy Luncheon helps support programs that bring our four pillars — Arts & Culture, Ecology, Education, and Recreation — to life. From seed libraries to artist-led activations, from hands-on learning to outdoor public spaces that welcome everyone, these pillars guide our mission to create a river that belongs to all.

Seed Series: Get Hands-On With Native Seeds

Every second Wednesday this fall, we hosted our ongoing Seed Series. This family-friendly gathering invited the community to label, sort, and package native seeds for the Confluence Park Seed Library. Guided by our dedicated River Warrior Docent, Brooke Adams, participants learned about native plants, biodiversity, and the crucial role seeds play in sustaining the ecosystems along our river. The Native Plant Society of Texas—San Antonio Chapter and the Alamo Area Master Naturalists support this work.

Stay tuned for more ways to get involved when we re-sprout our Spring Seed Series in 2026!

Kill Your Lawn – On Tour makes a visit to Confluence Park

Last month, we hosted a packed event with the Kill Your Lawn – On Tour, featuring Joey Santore, the creator behind Crime Pays But Botany Doesn’t. The inspiring presentation encouraged the community to rethink traditional lawns and explore native plants as living infrastructure—plants that evolved exactly for this place, supporting the wildlife and soils that have been here long before us.

Participants learned about:

The ecological cost of turfgrass

How native plants conserve water and build healthier soils

The wild, beautiful life that emerges when we let nature lead

It was an incredible turnout and full of inspired conversations. Stay tuned—more opportunities to learn, rethink landscapes, and engage with local ecology are on the way.

Growing a More Resilient River Community

Whether you’re sorting seeds, attending a talk, exploring Confluence Park, or visiting the Seed Library, every moment of engagement helps deepen our collective commitment to the health of the San Antonio River. Together, we’re nurturing a future where native plants thrive, wildlife flourishes, and communities feel connected to the natural world around them. Let’s keep growing—one seed, one event, one conversation at a time.

But it was still some time before I began to appreciate the human impacts of climate change, and how people contribute to the problem.
That summer, Jamie and I convened students in the Princeton program to discuss the threat of climate change and plan a youth climate march to demand policy action.
We need a cacophony of voices calling for an end to fossil fuels and for the emergence of thriving communities.","Eighty years after the founding of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and 55 years after the first Earth Day, humanity faces a growing profusion of existential threats. Most people—including politicians, business executives, and the financial institutions responsible for continued reliance on fossil fuels—know that climate change is a problem, and that it’s caused by human activities. But global leaders are floundering at the helm, and an informed populace hasn’t risen to the challenge.

Despite the deluge of information about impending climate catastrophe, climate scientists and environmental activists have failed to move enough people to action. As the co-founder of a youth organization advocating for climate justice—now working on fossil fuel policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council—I wish I knew why, given we have the solutions to transition our energy system. The youth climate strikes (as epitomized by activists such as Greta Thunberg) have lost steam, hard-won environmental policies are being overturned by every branch of our federal government, and 100-year climate disasters have become an annual occurrence. Apathy persists. If we knew why people turn a blind eye to the deterioration of the natural world around them, perhaps humanity wouldn’t be facing down doomsday. Nonetheless, it’s time to think more creatively about how to avert the worst of the climate crisis.

I’m 25 years old and a member of Gen-Z. Long before I was born, the scientific community (and the oil and gas industry) knew with confidence that the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere causes human-induced climate change (Artis 2024). This fact was communicated to global leaders and the public, most famously by James Hansen in testimony before Congress in 1986 (Hansen 1986). Yet, here we are, forced to endure the consequences of past indecision and inaction.

Growing up in Connecticut, I lived through back-to-back hurricanes Irene and Sandy in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Hurricane Sandy was one of the costliest storms in US history, and scientists have estimated that approximately $8.1 billion of Sandy’s damages were attributable to sea level rise caused by anthropogenic climate change (Strauss 2021). Of course, as a child, I didn’t think anything about climate change. I enjoyed the days off from school and the novelty of playing games by candle and lamp-light while rain crashed from the sky overhead. “Global warming” as I knew it was still a distant problem. On frequent visits to the Mystic Aquarium, home to several beluga whales, I learned about habitat loss and the threat a warming planet poses to Arctic species. At the beach near my childhood home, I learned about sea level rise and plastic pollution threatening our coastline along Long Island Sound. But it was still some time before I began to appreciate the human impacts of climate change, and how people contribute to the problem.

In the summer of 2017, I met Jamie Margolin at a summer program for high schoolers at Princeton University. Before arriving in New Jersey, wildfires in California and Canada had blanketed her hometown of Seattle, Washington, in a cloud of smoke and ash. She was the first person that I remember drawing a causal link between political support for oil and gas, and the impacts of so-called natural disasters that she was experiencing. After meeting Jamie, I recognized that climate change was not an unstoppable force of nature, but rather a political outcome that all of us can affect.

That summer, Jamie and I convened students in the Princeton program to discuss the threat of climate change and plan a youth climate march to demand policy action. This eventually led us to found Zero Hour, a global youth-led climate justice organization advocating to end the era of fossil fuels. Much like the idea behind the Doomsday Clock, we chose the name Zero Hour to convey a sense of urgency: that we were out of time to delay action on climate change any further. In fact, it was through these early organizing efforts that I first learned about the Doomsday Clock and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists; Arielle Martinez-Cohen, another organizer, let us use her song, “Two Minutes to Midnight,” for the video of Zero Hour’s Youth Climate March in Washington, DC (Martinez-Cohen 2018).

Since then, the Doomsday Clock has continued to tick, tick away, and it is now at 89 seconds to midnight.

These youth climate marches, led by Zero Hour organizers on every continent, helped to ignite a youth-led movement for climate justice. We were mobilizing our peers for the first time—a generation that was coming to terms with the fact that they’d experienced climate change their whole lives without anything being done about it from the people in power. In 2019, we helped to lead some of the biggest climate strikes in the United States, and welcomed Greta Thunberg to the United States to join us. We didn’t wait for approval, and didn’t care that so many people, even in the environmental movement, thought that we didn’t have the experience or education to lead a movement. We did it anyway, and we forged an intergenerational movement in the process.

It is time for the environmental movement to take risks and shake things up again. It’s time to build up the youngest generations of people to organize for climate justice again, and the Bulletin can help do that. Zero Hour made its mark on the world when Instagram was still being used to share selfies and candid shots—entirely unlike the manicured, influencer-heavy, ad-driven behemoth that the platform has become. Social media was our digital playground, and it’s a major reason why Zero Hour and other youth climate organizations have mobilized as many people as we have. Over the past several years, the media environment has continued to change—short-form videos now dominate social media and 54 percent of people get at least some of their news from these platforms (Pew Research 2025). Like the risks conveyed by the Doomsday Clock, attention is now counted in seconds, not minutes.

Social media has democratized the spread of information—today, any strong communicator can gain an avid audience—but it has also increased the challenge of communicating about complex, evidence-based topics like climate change. Like so many other young people, I often scroll on social media for entertainment and distraction, not to seek out news or ways to take action. In an era where there are limitless flows of content competing for the public’s attention, the climate movement needs to spark excitement instead of dread to capture the attention of people inundated with information. Where facts and science have failed, storytelling that evokes an emotional response may still succeed. The Bulletin can, and should, embrace this new horizon of social media to inform and activate Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha again.

In today’s political climate, strongly-held, ill-informed opinions trump facts, science, and expertise—any headline featuring RFK Jr. could tell you that. But when it comes to climate change, the science is settled: Greenhouse gas emissions, which have dramatically increased because of human activities, are causing the Earth to warm, and making the planet a far more dangerous and unpredictable place for human life.

When I joined the fight to end the era of fossil fuels, I presumed that when people know better, they do better. That belief—that climate education for the masses will lead to transformational shifts in our energy system and ways of living—is still widely held across the environmental movement. Yet, climate projections, models, and warnings from the world’s leading scientists urging policymakers to adopt policies to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius have been unsuccessful at convincing policy makers or the public to aggressively fight to end the era of fossil fuels. Enough about carbon reduction, it’s time to rally people around a transformation of our societies beyond just addressing emissions.

The Green New Deal is one ambitious proposal that does that. This is the kind of societal transformation that people deserve, and it leaves room to imagine what achieving it looks like wherever you live. A Green New Deal means environmental justice for everyone living in the colossal shadow of the oil and gas industry, but it also calls for universal healthcare, universal access to well-resourced and high-quality education, and a guarantee of good-paying union jobs. Adoption of a Green New Deal means winning the fight against climate change by doing more than meeting the bare minimum needs of the population. It is a vision for the future that humanity can thrive in, rather than getting by on scraps from the oligarchy. A Green New Deal is rooted in justice, and whether you live in remote Alaska, rural Alabama, or coastal Connecticut, the Green New Deal can be what it needs to be for your community.

When the Green New Deal rose to national prominence, right-wing politicians backed by corporate political action committees spent billions branding it as a radical socialist scam (Downie 2023). Vocal proponents in Congress, and even civil society advocates, have recently shied away from demanding a Green New Deal because it’s been bludgeoned in the court of public opinion by conservative media, trade groups like the American Petroleum Institute, and politicians like Donald Trump, who demonizes it as the “Green New Scam” (Thompson 2025). But while the Green New Deal has evoked the ire of corporations and the political elite, people across the political spectrum like the policy proposals at their core (Adcox 2024).

When the business-as-usual—or business-but-worse—policies of the current administration fail to deliver an affordable and safe future for all Americans, then climate and environmental activists, scientists, and well-informed politicians should have an ambitious and appealing alternative to offer them. The Green New Deal remains that alternative, even if it needs new framing for mass appeal. For too long, the climate movement has been plagued by a lack of imagination for a world beyond fossil fuels, and the mainstream environmental movement has failed to communicate the importance of dismantling the systems of oppression that have enabled the exploitation of people and nature for profit for hundreds of years. As a movement, we are reacting to every attack on the environment and public health coming out of the government, but this reactivity is why we’re struggling to build a movement with a long-term vision post-exploitation of nature and people.

We need more scientists, more business leaders, more journalists—more people everywhere—to step up and call for systemic changes to the way our society exists. We need a cacophony of voices calling for an end to fossil fuels and for the emergence of thriving communities. On its eightieth anniversary, I hope these words inspire the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to be a part of that cacophony of voices calling for radical transformation of our communities from leaders in power, and urge the public to demand their leaders achieve that transformation.",https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jan24-intro.png.webp,N,,2025-12-10 18:01:00.466343

[RUSH TWP, CENTRE COUNTY] – In a 2-1 vote on Tuesday evening, the Rush Township Supervisors in Centre County, Pennsylvania approved the pending permit for the renewable energy project known as Black Moshannon Solar.

The proposed solar project would generate 265 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 200,000 homes annually. At the same time, the project is being heralded for utilizing nearly 2,000 acres of toxic mineland, reclaiming otherwise unusable land, and including mineland clean-up as part of the project’s development. The project’s developers have committed to introducing pollinators and pollinator-friendly ground cover beneath the solar arrays, conducting water quality and soil studies throughout development and operations, and taking steps to enhance the soil by using lime to neutralize mining contamination and encourage vegetation to grow on the site.

The Black Moshannon Solar project is also expected to provide more than $5 million in tax revenue to support the Phillipsburg-Osceola Area School District and more than $700,000 in direct tax payments to Centre County.

In response to the approval of the permit proposal by Rush Township, statewide environmental group leaders and nonprofit clean energy advocates release the following statements:

“The bipartisan group of Rush Township Supervisors who got this proposal over the finish line should pat themselves on the back for this groundbreaking project,” stated David Masur, Executive Director for the statewide nonprofit organization PennEnvironment. “We are hopeful that other local government officials across Pennsylvania will follow Rush Township’s lead and implement similar, much-needed solar projects all across the Keystone State.”

“The Rush Township Supervisors are establishing productive farmland and sustainable energy infrastructure for future generations,” noted Jim Gregory, Executive Director, Conservative Energy Network-Pennsylvania. “In forty years, their forward-thinking decisions will be recognized as catalysts for environmental protection, public health improvements, and economic prosperity. The Conservative Energy Network-Pennsylvania commends their responsible leadership and dedication to the community’s long-term well-being.”

“The Black Moshannon Solar project is a perfect example of how renewable energy, natural resource conservation, and community benefits can align. This truly is a win-win-win for the community,” stated Nate Reagle, the Sierra Club Pennsylvania Chapter’s Clean Energy Program Advocate.

“As veterans, we understand what it means to serve something greater than ourselves,” said Moises Montalvo, Pennsylvania Lead Organizer for Veterans Power America. “Projects like Black Moshannon Solar give us a chance to continue that service—by strengthening our nation’s energy security, creating jobs for working families, and leaving behind a cleaner, safer country for future generations.”

“Approval of the Black Moshannon Solar project is a victory for the people of Rush Township, a victory for clean energy, and a victory for a sustainable economy,” stated Tom Pike, Clean Air Council Director of Campaigns. “This is the kind of forward-thinking work that communities across the Commonwealth should be looking to replicate.”

“This project is a powerful example of how local communities and elected officials are coming together to embrace solar energy. By redeveloping polluted lands for clean energy production, we can transform environmental liabilities into long-term economic and environmental assets, all while helping to lower rising energy costs for Pennsylvanians. It’s a no-brainer, and we hope other communities across the commonwealth will join in realizing the firsthand benefits of going solar,” said Abby Jones, Vice President of Legal & Policy at PennFuture.

The goal of the project is decarbonizing and reducing the mill's reliance on natural gas, said Irene Preto, the general manager of Kruger Kamloops Pulp.

The construction of the 10-megawatt facility, called the Kamloops Clean Energy Centre, is a collaborative effort between the Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc Nation, Elemental Clean Fuels and Kruger Kamloops Pulp.

On Dec. 8, Sc.wén̓wen , the economic division of the nation, announced the novel project.

The project prompted questions over why a pulp mill is choosing to produce hydrogen, and how it will be done. Here's what you need to know.

Why does a pulp mill want to produce hydrogen?

The Kruger Pulp Mill makes paper and pulp products using wood.

A part of its manufacturing process, the lime kiln, is particularly energy-intensive and requires a lot of heat — which is currently derived from burning natural gas.

""To be able to decarbonize the natural gas out of our lime kiln is a really big step forward towards our goal of becoming more renewable,"" said Preto.

The mill plans to replace 16 per cent of the natural gas used in the lime kiln with hydrogen.

When hydrogen is burned, rather than creating carbon dioxide, it creates water and heat.

Why hydrogen?

When hydrogen atoms are isolated, they can store and transport a lot of energy, similar to other energy-rich products like natural gas.

Hydrogen atoms are reactive, meaning they usually like to be combined with other atoms to form molecules — unless a lot of energy is present.

How is hydrogen energy produced?

Production is done in two ways: either by separating hydrogen from a carbon-rich molecule like methane (CH4), or from water (H2O).

But when carbon-containing molecules like coal or methane are burned for hydrogen production, carbon dioxide is released as a byproduct, leading to greenhouse gas emissions.

Some facilities capture and store the released carbon dioxide to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.

Alternatively, a process called electrolysis — which will be used by Kruger — uses electricity to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen atoms.

Preto says the resulting oxygen atoms will be used to strengthen the pulp the mill produces.

When the electricity for electrolysis comes from a renewable source, like wind or hydroelectric dams, the product is called green hydrogen.

Where is the electricity for electrolysis coming from?

The electricity comes from the B.C. Hydro grid — but it is actually produced at the pulp mill from wood byproducts.

Wood byproducts are burned to create steam, which then turns a turbine and generates electricity.

The process is called biomass cogeneration, and the mill subsequently sells the resulting electricity to B.C. Hydro, part of which will be used for electrolysis.

Why replace natural gas?

Zachary Steele, the CEO of Elemental Green Fuels — the developer of the project — said in this case, replacing natural gas combustion with green hydrogen will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“We're going to reduce the emissions by 7,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. That's the equivalent of taking 1,200 to 1,500 vehicles off the road,” he said.

Steele said simply using electricity from B.C. Hydro to power the kiln is not feasible, because it would require so much power it would stress the grid.

When will it be built?

Kruger received funding for the project from Natural Resources Canada through an Indigenous clean energy fund.

“The Kamloops Clean Energy Centre reflects our commitment to sustainability, economic self-determination, and highlights our leadership in advancing innovative, local clean energy solutions,"" said Kúkwpi7 (Chief) Rosanne Casimir of Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc.

The project is still being designed, and is a ways off from being operational.

Steele said the final investment decision is expected sometime in 2026, with construction beginning after that.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/cb146cc8-d2b2-4cfb-a406-12d2a14cbd12,1765250107245/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C76%2C1400%2C787%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-12-10 15:01:06.017295

House Republicans are implementing President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda, restoring our fighting force to greatness, deterring our adversaries, and ensuring our national security. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2026 codifies all or parts of 15 of President Trump’s Executive Orders and over 30 legislative provisions requested by the Administration.

This FY26 NDAA specifically focuses on reforming our broken acquisition system. Our current system is slow, inefficient, and doesn’t meet the needs of our warfighters – threatening our security and keeping us stuck in the past. The FY26 NDAA includes many of the critical reforms proposed in the Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery (SPEED) Act including by reducing burdensome red tape to streamline the delivery and development of new capabilities that our warfighters desperately need. It establishes the BOOST program to align promising technologies with operational needs, removes regulatory burdens, and speeds up the requirements process for defense acquisition.

The legislation also prioritizes improvements to our servicemembers’ quality of life. To ensure our warfighters are supported, the legislation includes a 3.8 percent pay raise for all servicemembers, widens access to health care and childcare, and improves servicemember housing.

Additionally, the bill works to counter adversaries such as China and enhance U.S. posture in the Indo-Pacific region, strengthen nuclear deterrence and missile defense, and fund Trump priorities such as the Golden Dome, F-47, autonomous systems, and new warships. The bill also fully funds the deployment of troops to the border and authorizes over $1 billion to combat drug traffickers.

While investing in innovation and streamlining development to ensure our fighting force remains the strongest in the world, the FY26 NDAA also cuts woke programs to keep our Armed Forces focused on their core mission: keeping our nation safe. Our legislation cuts DEI programs, restores meritocracy, and ends ‘Green New Scam’ initiatives, and saves taxpayers nearly $20 billion.

As threats to our national security grow more complex, we must make certain our fighting force is ready to meet the challenge, and that means delivering the capabilities our warfighters need when they need them. This legislation does just that.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers' legislation, H. Amdt. to S. 1071, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026, strengthens our national defense and the lethality of our fighting force by reforming defense acquisition, improving servicemember quality of life, investing in top defense priorities such as the Golden Dome, securing our border, revitalizing the defense industrial base, supporting our allies, and cutting wasteful spending and radical Left initiatives from our military.

House Republicans are committed to implementing President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda and ensuring our fighting force is capable and ready to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.

Ensuring Energy Reliability and Affordability

Electricity demand in the United States is increasing rapidly due to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the data centers that power it, domestic manufacturing, and electrification of sectors across the economy. North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) projects peak demand will grow by 151 GW by 2034.

However, while demand has been rising, so have premature retirements of crucial baseload power plants due to Democrats’ overly burdensome federal environmental regulations and energy policies implemented over the last several years. NERC reports that around 115 GW of thermal generation has announced to retire by 2034, reducing our electricity generating capabilities at a time when we need it most and further threatening our nation’s supply of reliable energy.

Many Democrat-led states have pushed for wind or solar energy by imposing “green” standards that shut down baseload power plants, despite wind and solar lacking the reliability, consistency, voltage, and frequency support needed to keep the lights on when we need it most. A recent Department of Energy report found that our projected demands for electricity, when paired with the projected retirements of baseload generating units, could potentially increase the threat of power outages by 100 times by 2030.

A lack of energy and energy reliability leads to higher costs for American households. Today, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to make sure states are planning electric generation facilities in a way that increases reliability and affordability of energy for hardworking Americans.

Rep. Gabe Evans' legislation, H.R. 3628, the State Planning for Reliability & Affordability Act, amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to create a new federal standard for state regulatory authorities to consider requirements for utilities to have reliable and sufficient generation from dispatchable energy sources as part of their resource plans over a 10-year period.

Part II – Strategic Responses: Building the Automotive Talent Pipeline Higher salaries alone will not solve the human capital challenge in the automotive sector.
Below are talent development and attraction strategies that some automotive companies have started using and have seen success with.
In many ways, the automotive talent war mirrors the historical labor battles of the industry’s early days, when production lines reshaped manufacturing employment.
Automotive Manufacturing Competitiveness – Strategic Levers to Transform Supplier Capabilities (last visited Nov. 30, 2025), https://www.adlittle.com/sites/default/files/2025-11/ADL%20US%20automotive%20manufacturing%202025.pdf.","For over a century, the automotive sector was defined by mechanical engineering, fabrication, and assembly line mastery. But today, the industry is undergoing a technological transformation so profound it is rewriting the DNA of car manufacturing. The shift toward electric vehicles (EVs), autonomous driving, and AI-enabled and other technology driven systems has turned automakers and suppliers into competitors in a new kind of battleground — one for highly skilled technology talent.

While robotics and automation have long been present on the assembly floor, the integration of complex software systems, machine learning algorithms, and AI-driven quality control has raised the stakes. Car companies are no longer just competing with one another; they are vying against Silicon Valley giants, AI startups, and tech-forward industries that already have pipelines for rare digital and technical expertise. For OEMs and suppliers, the race is not just about building the car of the future, it is about finding the people who can make that future possible.

Part I – Why Automotive Companies Can’t Fill Their Technical Roles

Despite the perception of abundant college graduates, the reality is a mismatch: there are not enough candidates with the specific skills the automotive industry requires at this moment. According to a survey report by Arthur D. Little and MEMA, “labor is the binding constraint on U.S. manufacturing viability and a competitive disadvantage.”[1]

Over the past few decades, a societal push toward four-year degrees has inadvertently reduced the volume of skilled trade workers entering the workforce. This makes it exceedingly difficult for automakers to fill crucial hourly production jobs. Historically, these roles were feeder positions into manufacturing careers, but fewer workers are prepared, or willing, to take them. The result is a shortage of the very people needed to operate advanced manufacturing lines.

More challenging still is the skills gap in automation, technology advancements, and AI. In modern automotive plants, AI systems aid in predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization, and quality inspection. However, these systems do not run themselves—they require a workforce trained not only in programming but in data analytics and machine learning applications unique to automotive environments. For example, a recent manufacturing study conducted by Deloitte Consulting LLP and the Manufacturing Institute (the “Study”) indicates that there has been a 75% increase in demand for simulation and simulation software skills over the past five years. But many of these competencies are far more common in technology hubs like San Francisco or Austin than in traditional manufacturing regions, leading OEMs and suppliers to compete for talent with tech giants whose compensation packages and work environments set high expectations.

This has created a secondary bottleneck: the engineers, data scientists, and AI specialists needed for autonomous vehicle development are scarce. According to the Study, the skills gap and shortage of qualified applicants could lead to over 1.9 million manufacturing jobs going unfilled within the next decade. Without sufficient workforce to fuel innovation, the industry risks slowing its trajectory toward the future it has already promised consumers.

Part II – Strategic Responses: Building the Automotive Talent Pipeline

Higher salaries alone will not solve the human capital challenge in the automotive sector. Companies need to reinvent how they attract, train, and retain people—starting far earlier in the career lifecycle. Below are talent development and attraction strategies that some automotive companies have started using and have seen success with.

1. Start Early: Build the Talent Pipeline in High School

Recruiting highly skilled technology talent can no longer begin after candidates enter the job market; hiring efforts must start by inspiring career interest in this specialized area at the formative stage. In other key manufacturing-driven economies, this student-to-employee pipeline is formalized. Specifically, Germany adopted the “Verbundausbildung model, where businesses collectively take responsibility for training the next generation of apprentices.”[2] Japan, Korea, Mexico, and China have similar programs in which industry is involved in the pre-hire training process. Id. In the U.S., where such a structured training pipeline does not exist, automotive companies may find success by engaging directly with high schools and community colleges — not just through job fairs but by hosting STEM-focused workshops, plant tours, and interactive demonstrations of how automation and AI function in the modern car-making process. These activities demystify highly technical roles and make them aspirational for young students.

2. Meet Gen Z Where They Are

Today’s emerging workforce lives and networks online, meaning recruitment strategies need to leverage the same platforms they use to learn, socialize, and job hunt. Social media campaigns showcasing a company’s technology, sustainability efforts, and career opportunities can spark interest among digital natives. Video content highlighting cutting-edge EV projects or autonomous-driving labs can convey both the skillsets needed and the excitement behind the work.

3. Offer More Than Paychecks—Sell the Culture and the Lifestyle

Recruitment has shifted from a purely financial transaction to one in which intangible benefits matter greatly, particularly among the next generation of workers. Potential employees, especially younger ones, want to know about company culture, career growth opportunities, and the lifestyle they can enjoy outside of work. For example, some Michigan employers have tailored talent recruitment efforts to market the “Pure Michigan” lifestyle — including proximity to lakes, recreational activities, and the growing cosmopolitan appeal of Detroit. By aligning talent attraction with local identity and quality of life, companies can differentiate themselves from geographically scattered competitors.

4. Partner With Community Organizations for Recruiting and Training

Local trade organizations, workforce agencies, and school placement teams are untapped assets for many OEMs and suppliers. These partnerships can provide access to pools of potential candidates and allow for collaborative training initiatives. For instance, community colleges and technical education centers could run co-designed certificate programs in EV systems diagnostics or industrial AI, creating ready-made talent streams that feed into local manufacturing roles.

5. Increase Hiring and Retention Through Internships and Mentorships

One overlooked aspect of talent strategy is ensuring that recruitment and hiring efforts have a lasting impact. This means closely analyzing the effectiveness of programs aimed at increasing conversion rates of internships and apprenticeships into full-time positions. It also entails building mentorship programs that give new and prospective employees a sense of connection and clear growth paths within a company, which can help develop loyalty and establish long-term career trajectories. Fostering loyalty, career advancement, and a sense of belonging at a company are critical and may be the deciding factor for wavering candidates and employees, as businesses compete against each other and may try to lure workers with lucrative offers.

6. Consult with Counsel Regarding Talent Acquisition and the Use of AI in Recruiting

Companies benefit from consulting with legal counsel on methods for identifying candidates with highly technical skillsets and AI expertise, and on structuring total compensation packages that are likely to attract and retain highly sought-after talent. Counsel are well-positioned to offer best practices and/or training about the use of AI in hiring practices. Companies should be mindful of the legal risks associated with using AI in the recruiting and hiring process, including the risk of unintended discrimination from third-party AI screening tools, which may expose them to liability under federal and state laws.

Securing the Sector’s Future

The automotive industry sits at a turning point. EV adoption and autonomous driving are no longer distant possibilities; they are active engineering and manufacturing challenges unfolding in real time. Success in this era will be determined by the ability of OEMs and suppliers to secure and cultivate a workforce fluent in both hardware and software, capable of bridging traditional mechanical know-how with next-generation digital capabilities.

This means reframing the definition of “automotive worker” to encompass AI specialists, data analysts, robotics programmers, software engineers, high-tech maintenance technicians, and cybersecurity experts — roles previously associated with technology firms rather than assembly plants. And it calls for an evolution in education strategy: not just waiting for universities to produce graduates, but directly shaping curricula, influencing career ambitions, and offering training that is specific to automotive technology.

In many ways, the automotive talent war mirrors the historical labor battles of the industry’s early days, when production lines reshaped manufacturing employment. Today, that battle is fought not over the physical assembly line, but over digital innovation, machine intelligence, and the minds capable of bringing these systems to life.

The companies that win will be those that start early, think creatively about recruitment, and treat talent development as a core strategic priority — not a secondary HR task. In an industry as competitive and fast-moving as automotive, the true horsepower remains human.

The order aimed to prevent any of the Outer Continental Shelf, including the entire coastline of the mainland U.S. and Alaska, from being leased for offshore wind development indefinitely until the president decides to lift the restrictions.

Additionally, the order calls for an immediate review of the federal leasing process for both offshore and onshore wind development, which will consider the potential downsides, including “negative impacts on navigational safety interests, transportation interests, national security interests, commercial interests, and marine mammals.”

The order suggested that current studies showing an environmental benefit from the turbines may be insufficient and requests new studies to assess the various impacts on the environment, economy, and energy grid.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued a ruling Monday vacating the order, arguing that the move was unlawful, siding with a coalition of state Attorneys General, including Aaron Frey of Maine.

Attorney General Frey shared a statement Tuesday applauding the decision.

“Mainers care about protecting our environment,” he wrote. “Whatever the federal Administration’s position is on wind power, it does not have the right to arbitrarily ban development of this sustainable energy resource.”

“I am gratified that the Court agreed that the Administration had once again, overstepped,” said Frey. “My colleagues and I will continue to hold Trump accountable to the law.”

The White House has stood by its energy policy positions, reasserting that their stance has proven to be beneficial for America.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

While the states bringing this case allege that the President does not have the authority to pause project permitting, the federal government has argued that the states’ claims represent nothing but a policy disagreement that ought to be settled outside of the courts.

These affordability concerns are well-founded. Federal data show U.S. electricity prices increased by 27% from January 2021 through January 2025 and by an additional 11% from January through September 2025, placing additional strain on Americans’ finances.

Electricity prices are especially high in traditionally liberal areas of the country. In total, 86% of states with electricity prices above the national average in the continental U.S. are reliably blue, having voted for the Democratic nominee for president in the 2020 and 2024 elections.3 In contrast, 80% of the 10 states with the lowest electricity prices are reliably red, defined as having voted for the Republican candidate in these contests.

Expensive Electricity Is A Choice: How States Shape Electricity

The data is clear: bluer states tend to have much higher electricity prices than red states.

More than almost any other product, electricity prices are a direct result of state energy policies because states have the exclusive power to decide which resources supply their grids.

Under the Federal Power Act (FPA), Congress preserved expansive state powers to regulate the electricity generated and sold within their borders. These powers allow states to determine their generation portfolios, site and permit power generation facilities outside nuclear and hydroelectric plants, regulate retail prices, and exercise authority over resource adequacy and reliability, meaning states are charged with ensuring that utilities, and electric cooperatives, often referred to as load serving entities (LSEs), maintain adequate power plant capacity to keep the lights on.

States can also enact energy policies requiring a certain percentage of retail electricity sales in the state to come from renewable generation under a renewable portfolio standard (RPS), or can set energy efficiency resource standards (EERS) or clean energy standards (CES).

The broad authority of states to determine their generation portfolios, set retail electricity prices, and establish mandates for wind and solar generators under the FPA has led to a diversity of policies that ultimately determine the price of electricity for families and businesses in the United States.

For example, Figure 1 shows the average all-sectors electricity price for each state from January 2025 through August 2025. In total, 86% of states with electricity prices above the national average of 13.54 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) in the continental U.S. are reliably blue, having voted for President Biden in 2020 and Vice President Harris in 2024 (see Table 1 in the Appendix).

According to Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, each of the top five most expensive states for electricity have mandates requiring 100% of their power to come from renewable or carbon-free sources, making their electricity unnecessarily more expensive. These, and other mandates, such as net metering requirements, are driving up prices across America (see Figure 2).

In contrast, eight out of 10 states with the lowest electricity prices are reliably red, and seven of these states have no 100% carbon-free mandates. Additionally, 20 of 25 states with the lowest electricity prices are Red states; only four are blue, and one is purple (see Table 1, Appendix).

State Spotlights

Each state’s energy mix and regulatory structure is unique. The state spotlights below highlight how policies enacted in state legislatures impact the cost of electricity for their constituents.

New York

Federal data show New York’s electricity prices were 58% higher than the national average and 62% higher than Florida’s, based on the average all-sectors rate from January 2025 to August 2025.

Furthermore, a study from the left-leaning Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) found New York has experienced some of the fastest increases in electricity prices in the country. Retail electricity prices for residential customers increased by 36% between 2019 and 2024, nearly three times faster than the national average and the second-fastest increase in the country during this period, after California. PPI determined that electricity is expensive in New York due to a wide range of factors, but the report clearly explains: “The convergence of shrinking supply and rising demand inevitably leads to upward price pressures for consumers. These costs are compounded by the immense capital investment required to transform the grid and specific policy choices that increase the cost of energy production [emphasis added].”

For example, New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) constitutes a massive renewable energy mandate, requiring the state to produce 70% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 100% by 2040, which will require substantial capital investments financed by ratepayers.

At the same time, the state’s firm capacity is being diminished by the premature closure of the Indian Point nuclear power plant, the state’s decision to deny the expansion of needed natural gas pipelines, and the state Department of Environmental Conservation’s decision to block a number of necessary upgrades for natural gas power plants, which the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) warns could cause an increased risk of power shortages over the next five years.

Prices are also rising in response to state policies mandating the electrification of buildings and transportation, which are straining New York’s already overburdened grid and necessitating additional infrastructure buildouts. The state also suffers from natural gas supply issues due to its decision to ban hydraulic fracturing. In addition, ratepayers effectively pay a tax on carbon dioxide emissions as part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The expenses associated with these policies are projected to be so large that New York Governor Kathy Hochul delayed implementing the state’s capand-tax mandates under the 2019 climate law. The state claimed the regulations would be “infeasible” because they would impose “extraordinary and damaging costs upon New Yorkers.” The Governor has approved two natural gas pipelines as part of a rumored deal with the Trump administration to approve offshore wind facilities.

These policy reversals beg the question: If Democratic policies make energy so affordable, why are they backtracking from them?

California

California’s electricity rates are the second-highest in the nation. Rates are double the national average. Governor Newsom and California’s state legislature have embraced numerous policies that intentionally increase electricity rates, including a carbon dioxide reduction mandate, renewable mandates, solar cost-shifting (net metering), nuclear reactor closures, and EV charging subsidies, to name a few. Instead of trying to expand electricity generation to meet the energy needs of Californians, California is second in the country in electricity imports, as it embeds policy goals in electric rates to drive social policy. This is a toxic mix for California’s ratepayers.

California is second in the nation in total electricity generation from renewable resources and leads the country in utility-scale solar generating capacity. California’s generation mix is 42% natural gas, 39% non-hydroelectric renewables, 12% hydroelectric, and 7% nuclear.

California’s sky-high electricity rates are not the result of scarcity, or being in the middle of the Pacific Ocean like Hawaii, but rather are the direct consequence of policies that deliberately sidelined reliable, conventional fuels (including large hydropower) in favor of mandating and subsidizing preferred renewables. In 2002, Senate Bill (SB) 1078 created the Renewable Portfolio Standard, starting with a 20% renewables requirement by 2017. In 2006, Assembly Bill (AB) 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act, capped greenhouse gas emissions, forcing the state to adopt more wind and solar generation. Billions in rooftop-solar subsidies followed through the California Solar Initiative and other rooftop solar incentives, which have caused massive costshifting. In 2015, SB 350 raised the RPS target to 50% by 2030; in 2018, SB 100 pushed it to 60% by 2030 and 100% “carbon-free” electricity by 2045. In 2020, Governor Newsom issued an executive order creating a goal for all new cars sold in 2035 to be zero-emission vehicles, and the California Air Resources Board implemented that executive order by adopting the Advanced Clean Cars II regulation. The Advanced Clean Cars II regulation required a waiver under the Clean Air Act from the federal government. The waiver was granted by the Biden administration, but Congress later rescinded the waiver. The waiver would have allowed California to set strict emissions standards, forcing more demand on the grid by effectively banning the internal combustion engine in the state. California’s experience demonstrates that aggressive renewable energy mandates and climate policies entail steep costs borne directly by ratepayers. The state’s electricity rates, now double the national average, are not an unfortunate side effect but the predictable outcome of deliberate policy choices that prioritize emissions reduction over affordability.

Florida

Among the nation’s most populous states, Florida is a clear outlier for electricity affordability. Florida ranks as the second-largest electricity producer in the United States, trailing only Texas. Florida’s subtropical climate, characterized by hot, humid summers, mild winters, and a hurricane season, presents unique challenges for providing affordable electricity. Its residential sector stands out nationally: virtually every household relies on electricity for air conditioning, and about 90% use it for home heating. As a result, Florida homes account for 54% of the state’s total electricity consumption, the highest residential share of any state.

Despite these intense demands, Florida delivers electricity at prices 2% below the U.S. average at 13.27 cents per kWh for all sectors. It achieves this mainly by generating 75% of its power from natural gas, even though the state has no significant natural gas production of its own and must import virtually all of it. This traces directly to policy choices made under uninterrupted Republican control of the governorship and both legislative chambers since 1999. During the shale revolution that began around 2008, Florida pursued natural gas generation, raising its share from about 40% in 2005 to 75% today. Florida has been successful by avoiding the aggressive climate mandates adopted by most high-cost blue states. At the same time, the state manages to maintain these relatively low prices despite frequent hurricanes that regularly damage transmission lines, substations, and power plants, forcing ongoing investments in storm hardening and rapid restoration that add to overall grid expenses.

Louisiana

In 2025, Louisiana had the third-lowest electricity rates in the United States. The reasons are simple—73% of Louisiana’s electricity is generated by natural gas and unlike California or New York, Louisiana has not attempted to implement carbon dioxide or renewable energy goals through its electricity generation system.

Louisiana is very strong in natural gas production and infrastructure, and it leverages that strength to protect ratepayers; it is the third-largest natural gas producer in America. Louisiana has a very strong pipeline network because it is home to the best-known natural gas market center in North America – Henry Hub. Low natural gas prices in the United States lead to low electricity prices in Louisiana. Besides natural gas, 16% of the state’s electricity is generated by nuclear power, 6% by coal, 4% by non-hydroelectric renewables, and 1% by hydroelectric power.

Louisiana’s approach to electricity regulation stands in stark contrast to states like New York and California, which have pursued aggressive climate policies, and the results are reflected in ratepayers’ bills. By prioritizing affordability and reliability over mandates, Louisiana has maintained some of the nation’s lowest electricity rates. The state’s regulatory framework allows utilities to select generation resources based on economic fundamentals rather than political preferences, avoiding the costly mandates, emissions caps, and renewable portfolio standards that drive up rates elsewhere.

Kentucky

In 2025, Kentucky had the 13th-lowest electricity rates in the United States and the lowest rates of any state east of the Mississippi River. Kentucky’s rates are 21% lower than the national average. The reasons are straightforward—67% of Kentucky’s electricity is generated by coal and 26% by natural gas. Unlike states such as California or New York, Kentucky has not burdened ratepayers with the carbon dioxide reduction mandates or renewable energy requirements that inflate electricity costs.

Kentucky leverages its abundant coal resources to maintain affordable electricity for families and businesses. As the nation’s seventh-largest coal producer, Kentucky is home to about one out of five operating U.S. coal mines, more mines than any other state except West Virginia and Pennsylvania. This robust coal infrastructure allows the state to generate 67% of its utility-scale electricity from coal, the second-largest share of any state after West Virginia.

Kentucky has also developed significant natural gas infrastructure to complement its coal generation. The state has 22 underground natural gas storage sites capable of holding almost 222 billion cubic feet of gas. In 2024, natural gas-fired power plants generated 26% of Kentucky’s electricity, more than nine times greater than a decade earlier. The remaining 7% of Kentucky’s generation comes from hydroelectric and non-hydro renewables. Kentucky’s pragmatic approach to electricity regulation prioritizes ratepayers’ needs over political agendas. By allowing utilities to leverage the state’s abundant coal resources while incorporating natural gas for flexibility, Kentucky has maintained low electricity rates. This is important for Kentuckians as more than half of Kentucky households use electricity for heating.

Conclusion

Electricity affordability is a function of state-level policy choices. States that have embraced aggressive renewable mandates, 100% “carbon-free” targets, premature coal and nuclear retirements, rooftop-solar cost shifting, and restrictions on natural gas infrastructure routinely deliver the nation’s highest electricity prices. California and New York, the poster children for this approach, now charge their residents and businesses significantly more than the national average, with price increases that have consistently outpaced the rest of the country.

In contrast, states that have prioritized dispatchable, affordable generation consistently deliver the lowest electricity prices. Florida keeps rates below the national average despite near-universal airconditioning demand and frequent hurricanes. Louisiana enjoys the third-lowest rates in the nation while utilizing its abundant natural gas resources. Both states have done so under sustained Republican governance that has largely rejected the renewablemandate model.

Americans pay dramatically different electric bills depending on which party controls their state capitol. High electricity prices are not an inevitability; they are a choice. And in state after state, they are a choice made by left-wing policymakers who have prioritized climate symbolism over working families’ budgets.

When even deep-blue New York is forced to delay its own cap-and-tax scheme because it would impose “extraordinary and damaging costs” on residents, and when California ratepayers are paying double the national average to subsidize an electricity system that still imports power from neighboring states, the verdict is in. Americans struggling with utility bills need the same thing Florida and Louisiana residents already have: state leaders willing to put affordability and reliability ahead of ideological mandates. Until more states follow the red-state model, millions of households and businesses will continue to pay the price for expensive electricity as a deliberate political choice.

The BMW EVs with access (i4, i5, i7, and iX) are natively equipped with the CCS1 charging port. To use Tesla Superchargers (and other NACS chargers), drivers must use a NACS-to-CCS1 adapter.

BMW plans to release its official NACS-to-CCS1 adapter in Q2 2026, which is a few months away. However, until then, customers may use a third-party adapter. It seems that Lectron’s Vortex Plus NACS-to-CCS1 adapter is the one approved by BMW. The adapter costs $174.99, has a BMW-approved interlock design, is UL 2252 certified, and supports a power level of up to 500 kW (up to 500 amps and up to 1,000 volts).

BMW’s official NACS-to-CCS1 adapter, shown in the explanatory video, looks different and has the BMW logo:

Here is a better look at BMW’s adapter via SimplyGregsterEV (@SimplyGregster / X):

Tesla Supercharging dispensers with a built-in NACS-to-CCS1 adapter (aka Magic Dock) can be used without adapters. However, this possibility has been available for quite some time to all CCS1-compatible EVs when using the Tesla app to start a session. Tesla has more than 2,400 such stalls in North America.

Software Integration

BMW Supercharging access via the Tesla Supercharging network is possible within BMW’s software domain, as the German manufacturer has integrated the network into its systems.

Once the driver adds a NACS-to-CCS1 adapter in settings (see the attached explanatory video), BMW’s onboard navigation will display NACS (SAE J3400) chargers just like CCS1 chargers.

Separately, BMW’s Plug & Charge system can automatically initiate charging sessions and payments at Superchargers, just like in some other networks. The Plug & Charge integration is handled through Shell Recharge, so a Shell Recharge account is necessary.

If a user does not have the Plug & Charge option enabled, they can manually start a charging session in the My BMW app (see the video instructions).

Of course, if one wants to use the Tesla app, then one can start charging and pay for it there.

Who Will Be Next?

The list of Tesla’s NACS partners has reached roughly 20 companies, including (chronologically): Ford, Rivian, General Motors (Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC), Volvo, Polestar, Nissan, Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Genesis, Kia, Honda, Acura, Jaguar Land Rover, Audi, Porsche, Toyota (including Lexus), Subaru, Volkswagen, and most recently BMW. The Subaru and BMW brands are still in the “Coming Soon” category on Tesla’s website, but it’s just a matter of an update to bring the list current, we guess.

There are also a few companies not listed at all, such as Stellantis, Mazda (now without an EV on the market), Mitsubishi (also without an EV), and a few other exotic nameplates.

Ultimately, all EV manufacturers in North America are expected to become Tesla’s NACS partners, as the network holds a huge market share of over 50% of DC charging stalls. Meanwhile, other charging networks have begun deploying chargers with NACS (SAE J3400) connectors, while manufacturers are now launching their first EVs with NACS charging inlets (see a list of NACS-compatible models here).",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251210-bmw.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 14:01:37.923756

Protecting the planet doesn’t have to be partisan.

There was a moment in U.S. history when pollution got so bad that the country did something rare: it agreed. Rivers were catching fire, cities were choked with smog, and people demanded change. In response, President Nixon, a Republican, created the EPA with a mission to protect human health and the environment, progress that crossed party lines.

That same grassroots energy that fueled the very first Earth Day in the 1970s is still alive today. In October, Senators Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Sheehy (R-Mont.) launched the bipartisan Senate Stewardship Caucus to protect public lands. Different parties, with the same understanding: we all need clean water, and breathable air.

When people speak up, politicians respond. We hold the power to shape the future, even if it doesn’t always feel that way right now.

While Trump Proposes Cuts to EPA, More Than Half of States Have Also Cut Their Pollution Control Programs Over Last 15 Years

Washington, DC – At a time when the Trump Administration is proposing sharp cuts to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, claiming that states can take on more responsibility for environmental oversight, more than half of states (27) cut their environmental agency budgets over the last 15 years, according to an examination of state records by the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP).

Illinois ranked among the top states in the nation for cutting staffing from its pollution control agency, slashing 20 percent of its staff, or 193 jobs, between 2010 and 2024, according to EIP’s report, “State of Decline: Cuts to State Pollution Control Agencies Compound Damage from the Dismantling of EPA.”

The deep reductions at the state level mean that the Trump Administration’s planned downsizing of the EPA – with a vote by Congress planned next month on a proposal to slash EPA’s budget – will have an increased impact on pollution control efforts across the country. Not only will the federal pollution cop no longer be on the beat, state authorities may not show up either — because state inspectors have also been laid off in many areas.

“The Trump Administration is attempting to dismantle EPA and rollback commonsense federal pollution rules, claiming that the states can pick up the slack and protect our communities – but that’s not the case,” said Jen Duggan, Executive Director of the Environmental Integrity Project. “The implementation of our environmental laws depend on both a strong EPA and state agencies that have the resources they need to do their jobs. But our research found that many states have already cut their pollution control agencies and so more cuts at the federal level will only put more Americans at risk.”

Jen Walling, Chief Executive Officer of the Illinois Environmental Council, said: “In Illinois, we’ve asked our environmental agency to do more every year while giving it less than it had a generation ago. Because the state hasn’t invested general revenue dollars in the Illinois EPA since 2003, the agency is forced to rely on volatile fee revenue and federal grants. A 21 percent cut over 15 years has real consequences and if federal EPA funding collapses at the same time, there will be nothing left to backstop these critical protections. We are grateful to Governor Pritzker and Illinois EPA Director James Jennings for rebuilding capacity and restoring staffing to 850 employees, but even with their leadership, the agency is still operating with far fewer resources than Illinois communities need.”

EIP’s report found that seven states reduced their pollution control funding by at least a third from 2010 through 2024, when adjusted for inflation. The steepest budget cuts were led by Mississippi’s decision to slash its environmental agency by 71 percent, South Dakota’s 61 percent cut, and Connecticut’s 51 percent reduction.",,N,,2025-12-10 15:01:23.938679

With California experiencing power disruptions as it switches to cleaner energy, some key Washington state officials have said they support adding natural gas to the facility.
“Natural gas today is under the gun, but it is the backup for us … to avoid the brownouts, blackouts,” Gregoire said.
In an interview, Fitzgibbon, the state House majority leader, said he’s not opposed to TransAlta’s shift to natural gas.
“Having coal out of Washington power is a huge milestone,” Fitzgibbon added.","TransAlta Corporation has signed an agreement with Puget Sound Energy to switch the last coal-fired power station in Washington state to natural gas.

The deal, which TransAlta announced Tuesday, comes as the Centralia plant is set to fall silent at the end of the month.

Its closure is part of a deal the Washington Legislature approved in 2011. The winding down of the last coal-fired unit represents a long-sought goal for Democratic state politicians: the move toward cleaner energy to reduce fossil-fuel emissions and combat climate change.

But it also comes amid rising concerns that the state could face a power crunch as it makes that transition.

In a statement, John Kousinioris, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian-owned company, said the switch to natural gas “will lower the emission intensity profile of the facility by approximately 50 percent.”

“This project demonstrates the valuable role that legacy assets can play in supporting the State’s clean energy laws and system reliability in a cost effective and timely fashion,” added Kousinioris.

Under the agreement, the conversion will deliver 700 megawatts of power under a 16-year contract that runs through Dec. 31, 2044.

With California experiencing power disruptions as it switches to cleaner energy, some key Washington state officials have said they support adding natural gas to the facility.

In an interview conducted before the announcement, former Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire said she supported the company burning natural gas there as a backup while planned renewable energy projects around the state, like solar and wind power, get built.

During her tenure as governor, Gregoire, a Democrat, helped negotiate the agreement between TransAlta and the state that led to the winding down of the coal plant.

“Natural gas today is under the gun, but it is the backup for us … to avoid the brownouts, blackouts,” Gregoire said. “We do want to move to a clean energy future, but we have to do it in a way that we don’t deprive people and businesses and communities of the energy they so desperately need.”

She isn’t alone with that perspective. State House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon — a key architect of Democrats’ clean-energy blueprint under Gregoire’s successor, former Gov. Jay Inslee — said he supports TransAlta putting a natural-gas facility there for the short-term.

Gov. Bob Ferguson’s office did not respond to emails seeking comment.

State Senate Minority Leader John Braun, a Republican from Centralia, said generating power through natural gas would help avoid California-style energy disruptions seen in recent years.

“We have to make the transition without hurting anybody,” Braun said.

‘Risk of power shortfalls’

The Centralia site had once included a neighboring coal mine, the largest such mine in Washington. By 2009, when Gregoire signed an executive order on climate change that declared an intent to strike a deal with the company, that mine had already shut down.

“They were having to bring coal in, there were all kinds of pressures,” Gregoire said. “Whether that was a safety issue, a health issue, whether that was a good economic future for the people of Lewis County.”

Subsequent negotiations led to the 2011 agreement being passed by the Legislature. The agreement spelled out the coal plant’s decommissioning by the end of 2025 and secured the company an expedited consideration for a gas-powered facility.

The deal also secured $55 million from TransAlta to be spent on several things, including energy efficiency and economic development projects for the Centralia-area community.

“You can shut it down, and walk away, but what you leave behind is untenable,” Gregoire said. “So it was really about trying to find the right way in which to leave the opportunity to help those people who would be out of a job, to retrain. And a new vision for Lewis County.”

A recent study commissioned by Puget Sound Energy, Seattle City Light, Avista, Tacoma Power and others contends that Washington is already on the cusp of an electricity crisis.

The shift toward wind and solar has prompted the region to retire fossil fuel power faster than it has been replaced, according to the report released in September.

“Adding weather-dependent resources without balancing them with reliable backup has left the grid more exposed to extreme conditions,” it stated.

The region “is going to have to add natural gas peaking plants as a critical backstop for reliability when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing,” Matt Steuerwalt, a senior vice president with Puget Sound Energy, said in a statement.

“A key finding is the region is at risk of power shortfalls, which could lead to rolling blackouts during extreme conditions, such as a winter cold snap during a very low [hydropower] year,” Steuerwalt said, citing that study. “This is a problem now — not 2030 or 2045, though it will get worse as demand continues to grow and more legacy power plants shut down.”

In an email, state Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, said officials continue to work “on speeding the transition to clean energy by increasing solar and wind generation; making our grid more efficient; and exploring technological solutions such as demand management to reduce peak period electricity demand.”

“I suspect that we will also be extremely cautious about approving major new drains on the grid, such as data centers, that do not bring along dedicated generation facilities,” Pedersen added.

In an interview, Fitzgibbon, the state House majority leader, said he’s not opposed to TransAlta’s shift to natural gas. Fitzgibbon previously chaired the House’s energy and environment committee and sponsored the low-carbon fuel bill that passed in 2021. That was a key part of Democrats’ ambitious plans to reduce carbon emissions that passed under Gregoire’s successor, former Gov. Jay Inslee.

The envisioned TransAlta natural-gas facility, Fitzgibbon said, wouldn’t be expected to operate decades into the future like brand-new construction. The lawmaker added that he isn’t aware of any law that the Legislature would need to change to allow the project.

“Having coal out of Washington power is a huge milestone,” Fitzgibbon added.

Braun, the Republican state Senate minority leader, also called the TransAlta property the second-best place in the state for the next generation of nuclear energy, behind the Hanford nuclear site in central Washington.",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1211_met_transalta-coal-plant.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 14:01:10.294610

The company will convert some existing lines at its EV manufacturing plant in Indiana to make ESS batteries.

Samsung currently operates out of the StarPlus Energy factory in Kokomo, Indiana. The site is a joint-venture between Samsung and Stellantis and was initially estimated to have a 34-GWh annual production capacity.

Samsung SDI’s prismatic LFP cells for ESS are packed in a 20-ft container, named the Samsung Battery Box (SBB) 2.0. The company launched the first edition of SBB with its flagship NCA cells in 2023. By expanding its portfolio into LFP technology, Samsung SDI is poised to strengthen its differentiated technological edge and further accelerate the global expansion of its prismatic batteries for ESS.

Compared to ESS using other types of LFP cells, Samsung SDI says its prismatic LFP cells are more resistant to external shocks due to the aluminum casing with safety design features like vents and fuses. There has been growing preference for prismatic cells from both EV and ESS sectors for safety reasons.

By using the prismatic cells, SBB features proprietary No Thermal Propagation (No TP) technology — preventing heat from spreading to adjacent cells by placing thermal insulation materials between cells and measuring the temperature of a specific cell through a prediction program.

§ 145.22(a) (2024); Class VI Primacy Application, 90 Fed.","The EPA’s November 2025 approval granting Texas primary enforcement authority over Class VI injection wells fundamentally changes who controls permitting of carbon capture and sequestration projects across the nation’s largest oil and gas state. For the 64 pending permit applications now transferring from federal to state oversight, this should improve permitting timeliness and accelerate projects tied to 45Q tax credits.

Texas became the sixth state to secure Class VI primacy, joining North Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Arizona. The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) assumes authority on December 15, 2025.

I. What primacy means under cooperative federalism

“Primacy” is authority granted by EPA to a state to administer and enforce a federal environmental program. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), a state assumes regulatory authority previously exercised by EPA while the federal government sets minimum standards.

Once primacy takes effect, operators apply exclusively to the state agency. The RRC becomes the permitting authority, compliance monitor, and enforcement lead. EPA retains oversight authority and can revoke primacy if Texas fails to enforce federal standards.

SDWA Section 1422 requires states seeking primacy to meet an “at least as stringent” standard across site characterization, well construction, area of review modeling, monitoring, financial assurance, post-injection site care, and emergency response. EPA conducts line-by-line regulatory comparisons.

II. Understanding Class VI wells and the UIC program

EPA regulates underground injection through the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program, authorized by the SDWA in 1974 to protect underground drinking water sources. Classes I through III handle industrial waste disposal, oil-and-gas-related injection (including enhanced recovery), and mineral extraction. Class IV wells—shallow hazardous waste injection into or above drinking water formations—are banned unless an injector obtains approval pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 144.13(c). Class V covers non-hazardous injection. Class VI, added in 2010, addresses long-term geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide.

Class VI requirements are among the most stringent in the UIC program. Carbon dioxide is buoyant, mobile, and corrosive in the presence of water, and projects inject massive volumes intended to remain underground for centuries. Regulations require sophisticated computational modeling to predict CO₂ plume migration, corrosion-resistant materials, continuous monitoring, and a default 50-year post-injection site care period.

III. How Texas earned primacy

Texas’s path to primacy began in 2009 when the legislature directed the state to pursue Class VI authority and established the legal framework for CO2 storage. The pivotal moment came in June 2021, when HB 1284 consolidated jurisdiction solely under the RRC—previously split between RRC and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality—and mandated pursuit of primacy.

Obtaining primacy required Texas to submit six core elements to EPA: a formal letter from Governor Abbott; a comprehensive program description; an Attorney General certification of adequate legal authority; a Memorandum of Agreement with EPA Region 6; copies of applicable statutes and regulations; and documentation of public participation.

Texas adopted comprehensive regulations at 16 Texas Administrative Code Chapter 5, which EPA determined meet or exceed all federal Class VI standards. EPA’s evaluation followed a four-phase process spanning three years, culminating in proposed rulemaking that received 7,534 public comments, the vast majority supportive, and final approval in November 2025.

IV. Why industry should pay attention

The practical impact centers on speed and certainty. EPA has issued only 11 Class VI permits nationally since 2011, with applications historically taking two or more years. As of late 2025, EPA had over 175 applications under review. By contrast, North Dakota and Wyoming have nearly cut Class VI permit review times in half.

For projects chasing 45Q tax credits, timing is critical. The credits—worth $85 per metric ton for point-source capture and $180 per metric ton for direct air capture—require secure geologic storage, meaning permitted Class VI wells. Projects must begin construction by year-end 2032 to qualify. Delayed permitting can destroy project economics.

Texas leads in announced CCS development. Occidental’s Stratos facility in Ector County—the world’s largest direct air capture plant at 500,000 tons annually—received EPA Class VI permits in April 2025. ExxonMobil’s Houston CCS Hub envisions capturing 50 million metric tons annually by 2030 with at least 11 major industrial partners. The Environmental Integrity Project tracks 34 proposed carbon capture projects statewide.

V. Practical takeaways for operators and legal teams

Companies with pending EPA applications should prepare for transfer to RRC jurisdiction. The transition requires no new application, but teams should familiarize themselves with RRC procedures and 16 TAC Chapter 5 requirements.

New projects should apply directly to RRC. The $50,000 application fee buys access to experienced reviewers with local geologic knowledge and shorter projected timelines.

In-house counsel should note one procedural difference: unlike EPA permits, suits for judicial review of RRC decisions do not automatically stay permit effectiveness. This shifts litigation risk calculations for both opponents and permit holders.

Finally, monitor RRC’s actual performance. Projected 12-month timelines are aspirational; the agency’s first decisions will establish real-world benchmarks. Texas has staked enormous economic and political capital on CCS leadership—the RRC’s execution will determine whether that bet pays off.

The MAX500 systems (500 kWh, 420 kW each) will charge zero-emission construction equipment and vehicles at locations where grid constraints and site logistics make fixed charging impractical.

Construction sites often face severe grid constraints, and heavy equipment such as excavators cannot be readily transported to distant charging points. Allye’s mobile battery systems bring charging infrastructure directly to equipment on-site.

“The MAX500 solves one of construction electrification’s most challenging problems: keeping heavy equipment charged and productive across sprawling sites,” said Alistair McNeil, COO of Allye Energy. “Our mobile battery systems bring charging infrastructure to the equipment, maintaining productivity whilst eliminating emissions.”

“The MAX500 systems from Allye offer mobile, zero-emission energy storage that helps construction sites overcome grid constraints whilst maintaining operational uptime,” said Josh Wright, CEO of Vital Power Group, Allye’s distribution partner. “Once deployed on our customers’ sites, the units will be fully supported by our comprehensive maintenance packages.”

The MAX500 is the first system in Allye’s range to feature DC fast recharging, enabling rapid replenishment from 20-80% state of charge in approximately one hour. This capability enables systems to recharge from any public DC fast charger or, for large-scale projects, to recharge each other in the field.

“By enabling our systems to rapidly recharge from DC sources—whether public infrastructure or other battery units—we’ve created a dynamic energy ecosystem that adapts to the complex logistics of large construction sites,” said Jonathan Carrier, founder and CEO at Allye Energy. “This capability will be rolled out across our entire MAX range.”

Allye Energy now offers four battery energy storage systems, tailored to different applications:

MAX300 (~300 kWh, 280 kW): a mobile, trailer-mounted system weighing under 3.5 tonnes with minimal ADR requirements. Suitable for construction sites, film and TV production, events and temporary power applications.

MAX500 (~500 kWh, 420 kW): offers an optimal balance of capacity, power and mobility for construction applications, featuring integrated DC fast recharging capability.

These corporations pay the greater of the regular corporate tax (21 percent of their taxable income) or the minimum tax (15 percent of their book income, with certain adjustments).
For some large corporations, the megabill’s corporate tax cuts create a new reason[6] their book income may exceed their taxable income, potentially exposing them to the minimum tax.
That’s exactly how the minimum tax was designed to operate, but it’s something that corporate lobbyists want Treasury to prevent by executive fiat.
First, they claim that Congress, in allowing the accelerated deductions, also wanted them to be fully exempt from the corporate minimum tax.","Industry groups are[1] lobbying[2] the Treasury Department to create a special exemption from the corporate minimum tax — enacted to ensure that corporations pay at least a minimum tax rate on their profits — that would give some of the largest corporations another tax windfall on top of their large tax cuts from this year’s Republican megabill[3] and the 2017 tax law’s permanent corporate rate cut[4].

Recent Treasury guidance has already weakened[5] Biden Administration rules governing the corporate minimum tax, which was enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA); this new guidance effectively exempts significant income of cryptocurrency, private equity, and insurance companies from the tax. The weakened rules and the hollowing out of IRS enforcement (which will make it less likely that corporations pay what they legally owe) mean corporations are racking up large tax cuts that weren’t enacted by Congress. Granting the latest industry request on the corporate minimum tax, related to firms’ prior years’ research and experimentation (R&E) costs, would give billion-dollar corporations yet another tax cut.

The IRA requires some profitable corporations that otherwise may pay little or no corporate income tax in a given year to pay a minimum tax rate on the profits they report to shareholders, known as “book” income (or book profits). The tax applies only to corporations with book profits of more than $1 billion per year on average over three years. These corporations pay the greater of the regular corporate tax (21 percent of their taxable income) or the minimum tax (15 percent of their book income, with certain adjustments).

Corporations may be subject to the minimum tax if their book income is much higher than their taxable income. This can happen if they reduce their taxable income with certain large deductions or other tax breaks.

For some large corporations, the megabill’s corporate tax cuts create a new reason[6] their book income may exceed their taxable income, potentially exposing them to the minimum tax. The megabill reversed a 2017 tax law provision that, starting in 2022, required businesses to deduct their R&E costs gradually over time (or “amortize” them) instead of immediately expensing them. Allowing R&E expensing going forward doesn’t itself create a potential corporate minimum tax liability because those expenses would be treated the same way under both tax and accounting rules. But the megabill adds an extra benefit: for R&E costs that corporations incurred while the 2017 provision was in effect (2022-2024), the megabill also allowed companies to accelerate their remaining deductions to this year.

For some corporations[7], taking these accelerated deductions could lower their taxable income enough to trigger the corporate minimum tax based on their book income. That’s exactly how the minimum tax was designed to operate, but it’s something that corporate lobbyists want Treasury to prevent by executive fiat.

Industry lobbyists are making two main arguments. First, they claim that Congress, in allowing the accelerated deductions, also wanted them to be fully exempt from the corporate minimum tax. Congress certainly could have excluded those deductions from the minimum tax — just as the megabill specifically exempted certain fossil fuel-related expenses — but the new law didn’t exempt the accelerated deductions. Treasury, in implementing the minimum tax, shouldn’t try to create deductions[8] not stated in federal law.

Second, industry lobbyists argue that exempting the accelerated R&E deductions from the minimum tax would encourage investment and innovation. But providing a new tax break for business activity that has already occurred can’t encourage new investment[9]; it’s just a large giveaway to corporations and their shareholders on top of other large tax cuts in recent years.

The centerpiece of the 2017 tax law was a deep, permanent cut[10] in the corporate tax rate — from 35 percent to 21 percent — at a cost of $1.3 trillion over ten years. Congressional Republicans added the R&E amortization provision (and several other business tax increases) to the law to partly offset the cost of the rate cut. But the megabill reversed most of those business tax increases without revisiting the corporate rate cut — giving yet another windfall to corporate shareholders and adding around $700 billion[11] to the bill’s cost.

Exempting accelerated R&E expenses from the minimum tax would have further increased the megabill’s price tag, potentially pressuring Republicans to offset the provision by shrinking other tax cuts or expanding the new law’s massive program cuts, which will take away health coverage[12] and food assistance[13] from millions of people.",https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_og_image/public/iStock-182175598.jpg?itok=bR_oEXW8,N,,2025-12-10 13:01:37.898051

Just last month, the EIA said it expected U.S. electricity generation to grow by 3% in 2026, more than a percentage point higher.
The report said the EIA expects electricity demand in PJM to grow by 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026.
“We expect most of the growing electricity demand in the PJM region will be met by growing generation from coal and solar, up 23% and 63%, respectively, between 2024 and 2026,” the agency said.
“In ERCOT, the fastest growing energy source is solar, which we forecast will grow by 92% between 2024 and 2026.”","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

The Energy Information Administration cut its 2026 electricity generation growth forecast by 1.3% from last month “based on how much large load electricity demand has come online so far this year,” particularly in Texas, “and its implications for near-term growth,” according to its most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook released Tuesday.

EIA now projects generation to grow 2.4% this year and 1.7% next year. The agency expects the United States will generate 4,327 billion kWh in 2026, down from a 4,382 billion kWh estimate issued last month.

Just last month, the EIA said it expected U.S. electricity generation to grow by 3% in 2026, more than a percentage point higher.

Much of the projected load growth is in the grids managed by the PJM Interconnection and the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, and the total downward revision appears to be driven by changes in ERCOT’s projected demand growth.

The EIA said it had revised its forecast of ERCOT growth rates since last month, shrinking its projections from 6% to 5% growth in 2025 and 15.7% to 9.6% growth in 2026.

The report said the EIA expects electricity demand in PJM to grow by 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026.

Even given the lower forecast, the expected increaseis “in contrast to relatively flat generation from 2010 to 2020 and is primarily driven by increasing demand from large customers, including data centers, concentrated in regions managed by” ERCOT and PJM, the agency said.

EIA also said it anticipated changes in the mix of energy sources used for generation in these two regions, while anticipating both regions’ largest generation source of natural gas will grow by 2% in both between 2024 and 2026.

Ambrose noted that while both planning and implementation processes have been well-researched, there’s been less scholarship on whether interagency collaborations transition successfully from planning to implementation — or why that happens.
“Planning and implementation are different activities, have different end goals, and require different organizational structures and responsibilities,” Ambrose says.
For example, the group collaborations for the Inland Bays, Tampa Bay and Tillamook Bay conservation projects began shifting toward preliminary implementation activities while still in planning stages.","For projects that require collaboration among multiple agencies and stakeholders, recent research suggests a different approach to moving from the planning stage to implementation.

Using four case studies, an NC State University researcher analyzed how 31 organizations collaborated on estuary conservation projects in the Delaware Inland Bays, Narragansett Bay, Tampa Bay and Tillamook Bay. The study found that these interagency collaborations started strong in earlier phases of the projects.

“These organizations tend to do a good job of planning, but then stumble when it comes to transitioning from the planning process to actually executing the projects,” says Graham Ambrose, an assistant professor of public administration at NC State who co-authored a paper on the work.

Organizations do a good job of planning, but then stumble when it comes to transitioning … to actually executing the projects.

Ambrose noted that while both planning and implementation processes have been well-researched, there’s been less scholarship on whether interagency collaborations transition successfully from planning to implementation — or why that happens. This lack of research has bearing on why organizations often apply planning techniques to implementation processes, and vice versa, with varying degrees of success.

“Planning and implementation are different activities, have different end goals, and require different organizational structures and responsibilities,” Ambrose says. “We think our contribution here is both practical and academic,” Ambrose says. “The primary goal of our work here is to offer more consistent and practical advice to practitioners.”

Smarter Steps for Collaborative Goals

In examining why groups struggle to get projects off the ground, Ambrose found that overlapping planning and launch phases can help collaborative teams stay resilient in spite of organizational shifts and changes. More importantly, it sets them up to achieve their project goals.

“Drawing on four case studies and the available literature, we find that groups are more likely to be successful if they adopt something we’ve termed a ‘mixed services transition approach,’” Ambrose says.

Instead of jumping directly from planning to launch — and treating each phase as a separate, distinct process — mixing these phases can help. Ambrose suggests small-scale implementation activities while groups are still working to finalize their formal planning.

Planning and implementation are different activities, have different end goals, and require different organizational structures and responsibilities.

For example, the group collaborations for the Inland Bays, Tampa Bay and Tillamook Bay conservation projects began shifting toward preliminary implementation activities while still in planning stages. Before finalizing formal plans, these groups piloted smaller projects to build support for their conservation efforts.

“Implementing pilot projects can help identify previously unanticipated challenges or opportunities, which can benefit larger-scale implementation efforts later on,” Ambrose explains.

Each group collaboration received funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Estuary Program, which provides planning grants to organizations focused on preserving estuary ecosystems. The groups that took steps to secure additional funding were able to transition to implementation more successfully later.

“EPA funding is limited and can only be used for a defined range of projects,” Ambrose explains, which means some groups had to contend with the fact that certain project goals were ineligible for funding. Ambrose says that collaborations that found additional financial support were better positioned to implement their plans and maintain the interest and goodwill of their stakeholders.

The groups that proved more resilient also devoted resources to outlining how the collaborative organization’s structure would change to help their collaborations shift toward implementation.

“Many of these groups were unable to successfully transition from planning to implementation, stagnated and were dissolved,” Ambrose says. “Other groups made some headway, and some have proved to be sustainable and resilient.”

Ambrose used an organizational research framework called the Collaborative Life-Cycle to explore transitions collaborations make as they move from planning to implementation. The study’s recommended mixed services approach adds an additional, intermediary step between planning and implementation.

“While this additional stage took more time, those that did not engage in mixed services had less success in the [implementation] phase,” Ambrose’s study states.

Over the past several months, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved a series of pesticide products containing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), often referred to as “forever chemicals,” for use on lawns and crops, including food crops such as soybeans, lettuce, and other vegetables. These approvals reverse what had been a movement toward restricting these chemicals in agriculture and signal a major shift in federal chemical policy at a moment when scientific consensus increasingly links PFAS exposure to a range of health problems.

PFAS comprise a vast family of synthetic chemicals valued for their water-, oil-, and heat-resistant properties. They appear in a wide array of consumer goods, including nonstick cookware, stain- and water-repellent textiles, waterproof outdoor gear, cosmetics, dental floss, and food packaging, as well as in industrial applications such as firefighting foams, metal plating, chemical manufacturing, and electronics production. In pesticides, PFAS help formulations to spread evenly on leaves, resist washing off in the rain, and extend product shelf life. Because they contain powerful carbon–fluorine bonds, they also resist environmental breakdown, persisting in soil, water, wildlife, and the human body for decades or more. Once PFAS enter the environment, they rarely leave.

The Regulatory Landscape

Before this recent deregulatory shift, government approaches to PFAS in the food system had been variable but generally trending toward more precaution. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for instance, authorized only limited use of PFAS in food-contact materials and, after safety reviews, secured voluntary phase-outs of these chemicals in the grease-proofing agents used in paper food packaging.

By early 2025, the FDA had declared 35 food-contact notifications for PFAS’ safety “no longer effective,” meaning that the agency no longer considered the supporting safety data valid. And, as a result, they were no longer legally authorized for use for those specific uses in food packaging. While not an outright ban, the FDA’s decision effectively removed these chemicals from legal circulation in food-contact materials. Yet at the same time, the EPA has been moving in the opposite direction, approving new pesticides containing PFAS and delaying compliance deadlines for drinking water limits.

These competing actions highlight a broader problem: the United States’ lack of a coherent strategy for regulatory oversight of PFAS makes it difficult for consumers, municipalities, and food producers to track or mitigate risk. The precautionary principle, which seeks to prevent harm before it occurs, has largely given way to a permissive stance, allowing PFAS into circulation despite insufficient long-term safety data.

Regulating PFAS is uniquely challenging because they are not a single chemical but a complex class of thousands. Each variant behaves differently, and long-term toxicological data on many are incomplete or nonexistent. Historically, regulators evaluated PFAS on a case-by-case basis. Some high-molecular-weight polymerized PFAS used in cookware coatings or gaskets were deemed low-risk because their large, stable molecular structures were not expected to break down or migrate into food, whereas PFAS used as grease-proofing agents in paper products were found to shed side-chains that could leach into food, particularly when exposed to heat or oils. The EPA argues that the newly approved pesticide chemicals fall outside the agency’s working definition of PFAS and therefore do not pose risks to human health.

However, many scientists and independent researchers do recognize these newly approved compounds as PFAS, and early evidence suggests they may behave like the broader class. Recent studies have identified PFAS in a significant share of pesticide formulations, and testing has detected PFAS-containing pesticides in rivers, streams, and other waterways, a sign that they are environmentally mobile and persistent. Although toxicological research on the specific PFAS now being introduced into pesticides is limited, their chemical structures share key features with better-studied PFAS that are known to accumulate in soil and water, resist environmental breakdown, and move through ecosystems in unpredictable ways.

What remains most concerning is the lack of toxicological data on these newly approved pesticide-related PFAS. While numerous studies link long-studied PFAS to immune disruption, liver and kidney harm, reproductive and developmental effects, and increased cancer risk, comparable long-term data for newer PFAS do not yet exist. This scientific gap means regulators cannot reliably assess how these chemicals behave in the environment, how easily they migrate into food or water, or what levels of exposure may be harmful. As a result, approving PFAS-based pesticides may be allowing a new generation of persistent chemicals into the food system without a clear understanding of their potential consequences, a regulatory gamble with implications that could unfold over decades.

What This Means for Health, Food, and the Environment

The health implications are substantial. Certain PFAS have been linked to liver toxicity, immune system suppression, hormone disruption, reproductive and developmental harm, and increased cancer risk. Approving these PFAS-based pesticides means that these chemicals can enter fields, waterways, and soil not only indirectly through manufacturing waste or in packaging but also directly through agricultural application. PFAS applied to crops can leach into groundwater, run off into rivers, or persist in soil long after the time of their intended use. There is growing evidence that plants can absorb PFAS, raising the possibility that food crops may become points of entry for human exposure. For farmworkers and rural communities already living near contaminated sites, these approvals may increase already long-standing environmental health burdens.

International scientific and regulatory bodies have increasingly recognized these hazards. The European Union designates some PFAS as substances of very high concern and is pursuing broad restrictions; the European Food Safety Authority has set extremely low exposure thresholds based on the immune and developmental effects of PFAS; Canada has proposed regulating PFAS as a class; and some countries, including Denmark, have banned them in food-contact packaging. Although toxicological data for many PFAS remain limited, global regulatory trends reflect the consensus that the risks documented for older-generation PFAS may extend to newer replacements with similar chemical structures.

Implications for the food system are also far-reaching. Introducing PFAS into agriculture creates new opportunities for contamination across supply chains, including those relied on by urban consumers who may assume that local or organic produce is free from synthetic chemical exposures. However, because PFAS can travel through water and soil, even farms that do not use PFAS-based pesticides may still be impacted. And these exposures also raise concerns for environmental justice, because rural communities and agricultural laborers typically face the highest cumulative exposure, meaning the total burden of pesticide contact that builds up over time from multiple chemicals and exposure pathways, leaving them at far greater risk than the general population and with limited political leverage to influence national chemical policy.

Ultimately, these policies threaten not only human health but also the health of the planet. PFAS used on crops do not stay in one place; they disperse into waterways, accumulate in soils, and travel long distances, affecting wildlife and degrading ecosystems. And the chemicals’ longevity means that regulatory mistakes made today may create environmental consequences that last for generations.

The recent shift toward leniency in the regulation of PFAS, particularly their approval for use in pesticides, marks a significant increase in the number of ways these chemicals can enter the food system. This moment demands that policymakers, researchers, and others working on food system issues scrutinize how current PFAS policies fail to protect human and environmental health. Developing a clear, consistent national strategy for managing these chemicals, one that is informed by emerging scientific evidence and long-term public and environmental health considerations, is essential for protecting our food, water, and community well-being.",https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2398892353-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 16:00:55.267806

At the AESC factory near the city of Douai, where production has been underway for several months, Chinese engineers and technicians supervise French recruits.

""They are the ones who train us on the equipment, how to operate it, how to fix problems,"" said Ericka Redjimi, 39.

Redjimi arrived at AESC in May without any experience in the sector.

""I sold clothes at open-air markets,"" she said.

Communication can prove complicated.

""We use Google Translate often.""

""I still need them, much less than at the beginning,"" but ""it's reassuring that they are still here,"" said Redjimi, who works in the section of the factory that makes battery cells.

Once finished, autonomous robotic sleds transport the cells to another section of the factory where they are assembled into battery modules that are used to power Renault's R4 and R5 models, as well as the Nissan Micra.

- Skills transfer -

By the end to the first quarter of 2026 the factory should be running at full speed, turning out batteries to equip 150,000 to 200,000 vehicles per year, said Ayumi Kurose, who heads up operations at AESC France.

He said the first few months of production had gone pretty much as expected.

""What's always complicated is gaining mastery of the equipment"" which often comes from Asia, and the training of staff, Kurose said.

Founded in Japan but now owned by China's Envision, AESC has been manufacturing electric car batteries in Asia for 15 years.

The group can rely on its in-house know-how to ensure ""good practices from beginning"" at its new factories elsewhere in the world, said Kurose.

He said there are currently nearly 150 Chinese experts working at the Douai directing 800 local staff.

These include experts in vision-based control of industrial machinery and cutting-edge soldering techniques.

""The goal is really the transfer of skills,"" said Kurose.

The experts ""come for between six months and two years, but they aren't meant to stay,"" he added.

The Douai factory should be ready to operate on its own by the end of 2026, he estimated.

One of the Chinese engineers also expressed confidence.

""I have to say, my French colleagues, they are always working hard,"" said He Xiaoming, 36.

If they acquire the necessary knowledge and gain additional experience ""they will go quite fast"", he added.

The nearby ACC factory, the first battery gigafactory to open in France in 2024, is also scaling up production after a difficult start.

""What we manufacture in a day now took us a month to do at the beginning of the year,"" said ACC's chief executive Yann Vincent.

""We're not yet where we want to be"", but in terms of the rate of defective cells and volumes ""we've made significant improvement.""

A joint venture of carmakers Stellantis and Mercedes-Benz plus energy firm TotalEnergies, ACC earlier this year struck a temporary partnership with a Chinese battery manufacturer.

The company, the name of which ACC hasn't disclosed, will manage one of its three production lines from A to Z until mid-2026.

Vincent said the Chinese have learned an enormous amount in two decades of manufacturing electric vehicle batteries, while France began from zero five years ago.

So ""it's better to rely on the people who know best"" to speed up learning a ""really delicate"" manufacturing process.

ACC, which currently employs 1,200 people at its Billy-Berclau factory, aims to manufacture batteries for 250,000 electric vehicles next year, against 10,000 to date.

Toyota’s $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina underscores a growing emphasis on hybrid-focused electrification, even as global EV sales climb past 17 million and approach one-quarter of all new cars in 2025. In the United States, EV sales hit record highs ahead of expiring tax credits, yet market uncertainty remains and hybrid demand is accelerating at a far faster pace. Together, these trends signal a shift toward diversified electrification strategies shaped by cost, policy, consumer behavior, and regional market dynamics.

The Battery Technology article reports that Toyota has opened a $13.9 billion battery manufacturing plant in Liberty, North Carolina. This 1,850-acre facility is Toyota’s largest single manufacturing investment and its first battery plant outside Japan. With 14 production lines and a planned output of 30 GWh, the plant will create 5,100 jobs and supply batteries to U.S. assembly plants in Kentucky and Alabama. Toyota is using the site to advance its hybrid-focused approach. The plant is vertically integrated, handling everything from cathode and anode processing to cell production and module assembly. Early production centers on hybrid electric vehicle batteries, reflecting Toyota’s view that spreading limited battery materials across many hybrids reduces more emissions than focusing on long-range EVs. The facility will also support Toyota’s first U.S.-built three-row electric SUV. Toyota is adding thousands of jobs, providing on-site employee services, and investing in local STEM education through $2.7 million in grants. State leaders say the project strengthens the region’s role in automotive and clean-energy manufacturing.

Global EV Outlook 2025

The International Energy Agency reports that global electric car sales passed 17 million in 2024, reaching more than 20% of all new cars sold. The global EV fleet grew to nearly 58 million vehicles, tripling since 2021 and displacing over 1 million barrels of oil per day.

China led the world with more than 11 million EV sales and an EV share close to 50%, driven by competitive pricing and a major trade-in incentive. Plug-in hybrids grew quickly, but battery-electric sales continued to rise.

Europe’s EV share held steady at about 20% as subsidies were reduced in major markets. Growth continued in the U.K. and Nordic countries, with Norway reaching 88% battery-electric sales.

U.S. EV sales rose to 1.6 million and passed a 10% share, though growth slowed. More models entered the market and leasing surged because it allowed buyers to benefit from tax credits.

Emerging markets saw the fastest growth, with sales up more than 60%, driven largely by affordable Chinese models and expanding local brands such as VinFast and Togg.

Government subsidies continued to decline, making up less than 7% of global EV spending in 2024. Early 2025 data shows sales rising 35%, and the IEA expects more than 20 million EVs to be sold in 2025, approaching one-quarter of global car sales.

U.S. EV Sales & Market Share

CarEdge reports that U.S. EV sales hit a record 437,487 units in Q3 2025, lifting market share to 10.5% as buyers rushed to purchase before federal tax credits expired. Tesla’s sales grew but its market share slid to 41%, while GM delivered the strongest gains, doubling sales and widening its lead over Ford. Hyundai Motor Group and Volkswagen also posted notable increases, though only nine of nearly 90 EV models sold more than 10,000 units. The surge was incentive-driven rather than a sign of lasting momentum. With tax credits gone, the EV market enters Q4 with significant uncertainty. Electrified powertrains continue to grow overall, but battery-electric demand is slowing compared to previous years.

S&P also notes that U.S. interest in hybrid vehicles is surging far faster than interest in fully electric cars. Hybrid registrations jumped from 3.1% to 16.3% between 2020 and 2025, nearly doubling the EV share, which rose to 8.6%. This growth is occurring across all regions and fuel types, showing a broad, sustained shift in consumer behavior. More buyers are switching to hybrids when returning to market. The share of EV owners choosing a hybrid doubled in three years, and gas owners shifted at an even higher rate. Hybrid loyalty has also strengthened, rising above 46% after a decade of lagging behind other fuel types.

Toyota leads the segment decisively. Nearly half of all new U.S. hybrid registrations are Toyota models—more than all major competitors combined. The brand’s hybrid mix is the industry’s highest, and Toyota reinforced its strategy by making the 2026 RAV4 hybrid-only. Regionally, West Coast markets post the strongest adoption, with several California cities, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. exceeding 20% hybrid share.

The once-affordable EVs, which benefited from the tax credit and aggressive lease deals, are no longer within reach for many consumers, exacerbating a broader trend of reduced demand for new cars.

Car prices have been climbing for years, but the pandemic and ongoing supply chain issues have exacerbated the situation. In recent years, EVs offered an affordable alternative due to government incentives, but with the removal of these incentives, the affordability of electric vehicles has diminished.

The End of the EV Tax Credit’s Impact

The removal of the $7,500 tax credit has significantly impacted the electric vehicle market. Once a key incentive, the credit helped lower the upfront cost of EVs, making them a more affordable option for many buyers. However, without these financial incentives, EVs have become less competitive.

November sales data showed a continued decline in EV sales, reflecting the broader trend. While the overall vehicle market showed a 6.3% drop in sales, electric vehicles saw the most significant decrease.

As Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, explained to Automotive News, the combination of high prices, elevated interest rates, and a lack of tax credits is pushing consumers to seek more affordable options. The removal of incentives has shifted demand away from EVs, with buyers opting for hybrid models or cheaper gasoline-powered vehicles instead.

Rising Vehicle Prices Squeeze Buyers

The steep rise in vehicle prices is not limited to EVs. Gas-powered trucks and SUVs, which typically dominate the market, have also become less affordable for many consumers. Ford’s recent sales report shows that sales of its utility vehicles dropped by 4.9%, while sales of entry-level trims on models like the Maverick and Ranger surged by double digits. This indicates that consumers are becoming more focused on affordability, with a shift toward lower-priced models despite the overall high cost of new cars.

Honda, too, reported a decline in sales, with total sales dropping by 15% in November. The company attributed some of the decline to global semiconductor shortages, which have affected production and inventories. As of November, Honda’s stock of vehicles was down to just over 145,000 models, a significant drop from the previous month. This reduction in supply, combined with high prices, has made it more challenging for consumers to find affordable new vehicles, reports InsideEVs.

EVs Are the Hardest Hit

Electric vehicles have borne the brunt of the sales downturn, as the absence of tax incentives makes them even more expensive. The Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and other previously affordable EVs have seen significant sales declines in recent months. Meanwhile, hybrid models, which offer a more traditional driving experience, have gained some traction, though they, too, are affected by the overall rise in vehicle prices.

With prices for new vehicles continuing to climb, many consumers are choosing to hold on to their older cars for longer or are turning to used vehicles, which, despite their own price increases, are still more affordable than new cars. While holiday deals may offer temporary relief, the long-term outlook remains uncertain, with consumers facing increasingly difficult choices in the face of high prices and limited incentives.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/a-car-against-a-background-of-American-dollar-bills.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 13:01:09.698886

Among them was Patricia Brown, a longtime Sante Fe County resident and member of the New Mexico Energy Policy Research Advisory.
NEE has been leaning on its twofold outreach strategy to educate New Mexicans about the implications of taking New Mexico utility companies private.","New Mexico is the fifth-largest state by landmass. With its abundance of sunshine and wind, the Land of Enchantment is “a natural location for renewable energy production and clean energy jobs,” the New Mexico State Land Office explains on its website.

This ample renewable generation capacity has positioned New Mexico well to supply clean energy to Western states. According to Mariel Nanasi, executive director and president of New Energy Economy (NEE), “New Mexico can not only meet all of its energy needs through renewables and storage but could also produce electricity for the highly consumptive and populous states of Arizona and California.” Using transmission interties and wholesale market arrangements, it often does just that.

More from James Baratta

But Nanasi and her organization have sounded the alarm on a bid by Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, to acquire TXNM Energy for $11.5 billion. Announced in May, the deal would give Blackstone control of TXNM subsidiaries Texas-New Mexico Power and the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), which serve 800,000 customers. Unlike a leveraged buyout, the acquisition would be fully funded with equity.

For Nanasi, the proposed acquisition threatens to harm ratepayers by enabling the construction of data centers across New Mexico, rather than supplying affordable power to those who need it. “Blackstone sees this purchase as a very important strategic foray into the West,” she told the Prospect.

Before obtaining TXNM, Blackstone must secure regulatory approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, or PRC. Blackstone also finds itself at the center of an ongoing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proceeding, the outcome of which will determine whether the world’s largest alternatives asset manager can acquire TXNM without undermining wholesale competition or transmission service, causing undue cross-subsidization, or adversely impacting consumers. NEE has intervened in all three proceedings.

Blackstone is not the only private equity player carving up New Mexico’s utility infrastructure. Bernhard Capital Partners, a smaller private equity firm based in Louisiana, has been seeking regulatory approval for its proposed acquisition of New Mexico Gas Company (NMGC), the state’s largest natural gas utility. Bernhard reached an agreement with Emera, the utility’s parent company, to acquire NMGC for approximately $1.3 billion last year. The firm also owns traditional energy assets in Louisiana and Mississippi, after acquiring CenterPoint Energy and Entergy’s natural gas distribution businesses earlier this year.

For its part, Blackstone has a 5 percent stake in the embattled Ohio-based electric utility FirstEnergy, and 20 percent of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, which is reportedly planning to expand its natural gas power plants to meet electricity demand from data centers. Acquiring TXNM would be a first for Blackstone, as the $1 trillion private markets manager has never owned a regulated utility outright.

A spokesperson for Blackstone told the Prospect the firm is “the right partner to support PNM’s long-term growth” and that PNM would operate as a stand-alone business with its own leadership, with strictly regulated rates from the PRC.

But the Center for Biological Diversity, an intervenor in the FERC case, recently argued that Blackstone’s application neglects the anti-competitive effects of acquiring TXNM on customers, as the company could leverage its ownership of the utility in its continued pursuit of data center investments. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) acknowledged as much in their December 4 letter to Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman.

“Private equity’s money-extracting playbook isn’t anything new, and the consequences that usually follow aren’t either,” the senators wrote.

BLACKSTONE HAS OFFERED TO PAY a 23 percent acquisition premium, or about $2 billion more than TXNM’s book value at the time the agreement was announced. The firm has proposed a $105 million rate credit to be distributed over a four-year period, equating to $3.51 a month for the average residential ratepayer. But NEE argues the rate credits on the table “are highly likely to prove illusory,” in large part because of the rate shock customers could face if the deal goes through.

Blackstone has also announced a $10 million Good Neighbor Fund to assist low-income ratepayers over a ten-year period. The firm has demonstrated its willingness to lay out $25 million in investments for innovative technologies related to grid modernization, as well as $35 million to support economic and workforce development.

“As part of the regulatory process, which includes further engagement with parties to the case, there will be opportunities for further discussions around the different ways affordability can be addressed with the benefits proposed in the application,” a TXNM spokesperson told the Prospect.

The PRC and most state-level utility commissions have made it clear that customers cannot be charged any acquisition-related transaction costs, but critics say Blackstone could try to recover those costs indirectly by requesting a higher return on equity (ROE) in future rate cases, or by increasing capital spending, both of which are part and parcel of the investor-owned utility financial model.

Blackstone disputes this, stating that the PRC and FERC “determine returns on equity and have oversight over capital spending; Blackstone Infrastructure and PNM do not control the authorized return on equity and PNM cannot recover capital spend in customer rates without commission approval.” (Bernhard Capital, in its attempted takeover of NMGC, has explicitly stated that customers “will not, directly or indirectly,” bear the costs of the acquisition.)

Apart from customer benefits, there’s also the question of whether Blackstone would allow the PRC to preserve its jurisdiction over TXNM. Nanasi asserts it would not.

“Blackstone has more money than the state of New Mexico,” she said. “They’re paying $2 billion more than the company’s worth because their plan is to get that back and then make some more money on it, so that’s how confident they are that they’re going to sweep us clean.”

The thrust behind her concern is the potential for affiliate transaction risk. Blackstone could leverage its ownership of PNM to benefit its investments in data centers and other businesses throughout the state. The firm owns three companies that already do business in New Mexico, including data center developer QTS. Under the PRC’s six-part test, Blackstone must demonstrate that it will not use PNM to give preferential treatment to its portfolio companies or cross-subsidize non-utility businesses like data centers. As a regulated utility, PNM has a monopoly on the delivery of electricity in its service area, which is why the burden is on Blackstone to prove that the company will not force ordinary ratepayers to pay more for electricity as a result of its non-utility activities. NEE has suggested that “Blackstone’s opaque corporate structure and history of self-dealing through affiliate transactions undermine transparency and regulatory oversight.”

Conversely, Blackstone argues that “any interactions between affiliates are subject to adherence to local and federal regulations that focus specifically on avoiding unfair advantages or disadvantages.”

But private equity firms should be expected to use every tool in their arsenal to influence regulatory decisions. One example comes from the Bernhard-NMGC case, which is further along in the PRC process than the Blackstone bid.

On October 20, Bernhard and NMGC filed a motion to exclude the direct testimony of NEE witness Jesse George. In addition to his work as an attorney focusing on utility regulation in Louisiana, he serves as New Orleans policy director at the Alliance for Affordable Energy. The PRC hearing examiners disqualified George as an expert witness, based on the apparent lack of evidence for his qualifications to “testify on New Mexico regulatory law or policy,” per the November 3 ruling.

George’s testimony focused on utilities Bernhard has owned, including National Water Infrastructure (NWI), one of the largest sewer utility companies in Louisiana. According to the Energy and Policy Institute, an inspection by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality “revealed a large amount of sludge build-up, with bloodworms observed throughout the sludge—indicative of stagnant water containing organic matter often associated with sanitary waste.” Bernhard denied any wrongdoing, though it paid a small settlement to the department. In his testimony, George urged the PRC to consider Bernhard’s track record at NWI in its application of the six-factor test.

“I think this sort of reducing of his status is pretty unusual,” said Keriann Conroy, research associate at the Energy and Policy Institute. “The only detail that we get from the hearing examiners [is that George] is not qualified because they couldn’t find evidence that he has other significant regulatory experience, so that seems sort of like a denial of his experience in Louisiana in some ways.”

At a November 25 hearing, numerous public commenters expressed opposition to Bernhard’s proposed acquisition of NMGC. Among them was Patricia Brown, a longtime Sante Fe County resident and member of the New Mexico Energy Policy Research Advisory. She argued the PRC’s constitutional duty to regulate the state’s public utilities “was effectively subordinated when the hearing examiners barred from the record the history of fines, violations, audits, investigations and settlements associated with Bernhard Capital Partners and its affiliates.” Brown said that information “is directly relevant to whether the firm can be trusted to operate New Mexico’s gas systems safely, prudently and honestly.”

These types of maneuvers were also seen the last time TXNM tried to sell itself. In November 2021, the New Mexico PRC rejected the company’s proposed merger with Avangrid, an energy services company and subsidiary of the Spanish multinational electric utility conglomerate Iberdrola. The ruling concluded nearly two years of regulatory proceedings that exposed the prospective buyers’ “record of poor service, high rates, safety violations, bad faith contracts and market manipulation,” according to NEE.

The following year, PNM and Avangrid appealed the PRC’s decision to the New Mexico Supreme Court. NEE described the move as “an effort to circumvent the authority and oversight of the Commission in their failed attempt to establish a ‘beachhead’ for domination of the energy generation potential in New Mexico at the expense of New Mexico electricity customers.” The group also alleged that “Avangrid and Iberdrola engaged in back door ex-parte communications” to convince the PRC to remand the case. The prospective buyers also threatened legal action against NEE, the only intervenor in the proceeding to oppose the deal, before abandoning their acquisition bid in January 2024.

While that had a favorable outcome from NEE’s standpoint, the persistence shows the disadvantage of public-interest organizations relative to private buyers.

PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONERS in New Mexico are appointed by the governor to serve six-year terms. In 2020, voters approved a constitutional amendment that restructured the PRC to be governed by three appointees rather than five elected commissioners, who previously served four-year terms. New Mexico has since counted itself among states like Minnesota where the governor is responsible for appointing public utility commissioners. The Prospect previously chronicled BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ efforts to manufacture support for its ultimately successful acquisition of ALLETE, detailing how the Minnesota Department of Commerce consulted with local environmental groups that came out in support of the deal. A similar saga is playing out in New Mexico.

As The Candle reported, Dominic Gabello, a former senior adviser to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) and independent consultant, arranged a meeting between his clients at Bernhard and Grisham to “talk about their vision for the company and how the acquisition is progressing.” Both Gabello and Grisham have been silent on the meeting, which reportedly occurred on the morning of October 11, 2024. The Candle also observed that Gabello has yet to register with the New Mexico secretary of state as a lobbyist for Bernhard.

NEE has been leaning on its twofold outreach strategy to educate New Mexicans about the implications of taking New Mexico utility companies private. “We have a legal strategy, and we have a political strategy, and we at all times try to marry those,” Nanasi told the Prospect. “Our jobs are to be translators.”

As part of its political strategy, NEE has taken to highlighting the inherent irony of the name Blackstone gave to the holding company it will use to acquire PNM: Troy ParentCo.

“The mission of the Trojan horse, a ruse, was to destroy Troy from the inside,” Nanasi said. “Blackstone is offering a Trojan horse to ratepayers; it’s a deceptive gift, and one that will ultimately dominate and destroy us if we allow them to enter New Mexico.”",https://i0.wp.com/prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Baratta-Blackstone-NM-power.jpg?fit=2121%2C1414&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-10 16:02:05.752060

It’s also important to remember that risk forecasts aren’t guarantees, and climate change isn’t the only factor at play.","Earlier this month, the real-estate listing site Zillow ended a subtle social experiment. In 2024, they began to embed climate risk data directly in their property profiles, scoring a home’s future risks from flood, wildfire, wind, heat, and air quality on a 1-to-10 scale.

Say you are looking for a home in your budget for your growing family, and you find the perfect three-bedroom Cape Cod house — but it’s close to a shoreline. Zillow’s property listing might show that it has a nine out of 10 flood risk score. Depending on your personal risk tolerance, that might rule out the house for you.

Including this information seemed like an obvious move for Zillow. Disasters worsened by warming are contributing to multibillion-dollar damages to homes, and the site’s competitors, such as Redfin, already feature climate risk information in their listings.

“Climate risks are now a critical factor in home-buying decisions,” Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow, said in a statement last year.

Zillow’s own data proved that many homebuyers were indeed starting to think more about climate change alongside square footage, nearby schools, and curb appeal — so much so that real estate agencies and sellers complained that the climate risk scores were starting to hurt sales.

Which is kind of the point.

Giving homebuyers a sense of where warming temperatures could lead to a higher chance of a wildfire or flood should ideally steer people away from properties facing greater danger. Over time, people would buy safer homes — and if they chose to buy in riskier areas, at least they were forewarned and could boost their insurance policies.

Key Takeaways

Real-estate listing site Zillow began including climate disaster risk scores in its property listings last year, but recently removed them after complaints from realtors and sellers that the information was hurting sales.

This is just one example of how sellers, realtors, and governments have sought to limit the use of risk forecasts that factor in climate change because of the effects on real estate.

But just because some want to bury their heads in the sand when it comes to climate risk doesn’t mean these dangers will go away.

Communities that have examined their own risks and taken steps to reduce them have seen benefits. One community near Lake Tahoe managed to reduce property insurance rates after taking steps to reduce wildfire risks.

But climate risk assessments are not great if your current house has a bad score, and you’re trying to sell it. Under pressure from real estate groups, Zillow stopped including them. The climate risks, of course, haven’t gone away.

Welcome to the “la, la, la, can’t hear you” climate era.

In many parts of the US, populations are still increasing in areas vulnerable to disasters such as floods, extreme heat, drought, and fires, while the federal government under President Donald Trump is removing references to climate change from government websites.

People, too, will cover their eyes when the climate reality threatens real estate prices. Clear Lake, Texas, for example, installed signs showing the potential high water mark from storm surge after Hurricane Ike in 2011, but when locals complained that the warnings were hurting sales, the signs were taken down. In 2012, North Carolina outlawed a forecast of sea level rise that showed that many more coastal properties were at risk of flooding over the next century, in favor of adopting a forecast that only looked 30 years ahead.

Yet, while sellers might want to overlook future risks, banks, insurance companies, and buyers don’t want to lose money on what is often their single-most expensive purchase. More costly disaster damages are also taking a bigger bite out of the $55 trillion US residential housing market as a whole.

“I don’t think this is a good thing for anyone but Zillow — people need to know more about their risk, not less,” said Marc Ragin, a researcher studying disaster risk at the University of Georgia, in an email.

Anticipating future threats worsened by climate change is not just about creating warnings, though; they can be useful tools for adapting to climate change. One community that took them seriously actually saved money by lowering their property insurance rates. Here’s how.

What happens when you actually grapple with climate risk

Wildfires regularly confront the communities around Lake Tahoe in Nevada and California. Though the flames rarely make it into neighborhoods, the basin is often bathed in choking smoke from nearby blazes, and residents are starting to realize that it’s only a matter of time before they will face an inferno up close.

The Tahoe Fund, a nonprofit, took an unflinching look at the wildfire risks in the area and launched a pilot project this year to create “the most fire-ready community in Tahoe.” They laid out their process in a playbook for reducing fire risks that they hope any place looking to reduce the odds of homes going up in flames could draw on.

They began with a homeowners association in pine-forested Incline Village, Nevada — home to 9,000 people — where the average home price is $1.4 million. The association, Tyrolian Village, is composed of 228 homes. Using a mix of fire risk models, the Tahoe Fund team identified the areas most primed to burn. The models they used were more sophisticated than those used on real estate sites and more tailored to the community, but it helped the team get more bang for their buck when it came to figuring out what tactics would best improve the neighborhood’s fire resilience.

“Through technology, you don’t necessarily need to do everything,” said Amy Berry, who leads the Tahoe Fund. “You need to do the things that are the most important that are going to have the biggest impact on lowering risk.”

They then reached out to community leaders to set priorities for measures like reducing fuel loads in public areas, building defensible spaces, and making homes more fire-resistant, drawing on public funds and private donations. The pilot project also gave homeowners individual fire risk assessments and to-do lists, offering grants to spur owners of the highest-priority homes to act.

The effort is already starting to produce results. Tyrolian Village saw its home insurance premiums drop by one-third. Berry said that this kind of targeted risk reduction could be applied in many places.

Insurance looms in the background of any discussion of disasters. In California, insurance companies have been dropping customers whose wildfire risks were too hot to handle. In states like Florida and Louisiana, some private insurers have stopped insuring new properties, gone bankrupt, or left the market entirely. The federally backed National Flood Insurance Program is continually losing billions of dollars. So, a project that measurably reduces risks is encouraging.

Yet, there are still many people in the community who are reluctant to grapple with the threats they face. “We emailed everyone. We sent postcards. We said open your reports, so you know what to do, and only 50 of the homeowners have opened their reports,” Berry said.

It’s also important to remember that risk forecasts aren’t guarantees, and climate change isn’t the only factor at play. Plenty of homes that aren’t in established flood zones still flood, while some in high-risk areas have kept their basements dry. The same goes for homes inside and outside high fire-risk zones.

Still, having even a vague sense of where risks to property are higher and lower can be useful for planning things like storm drains and seawalls. Individual homebuyers could start to include climate risk assessments in their home inspections, checking structures for fire-resistant materials and water runoff alongside termite damage and cracks in the foundation.

But, that requires buyers to realize these perils are out there. Past research showed that another driver of real estate prices in vulnerable areas was belief in climate change. Homes in at-risk communities where people took threats of rising temperatures seriously sold for less than in flood zones where residents did not think climate change was a problem.

People also quickly forget the lessons of past disasters, often rebuilding and expanding in an area that’s flooded or burned. And it’s even harder to get people to adapt to things that they’ve never experienced before.

So, while forecasting climate change and adapting to emerging threats are still immense challenges, the biggest hurdle is human behavior, getting people to actually engage with the dangers they face. Hiding this information can only help sellers for a little while before the bill comes due.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/GettyImages-1243090769.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-12-10 12:02:40.294543

“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement.
“The SRS program is vital to maintaining schools, roads and emergency response services in rural, forested counties,” Crapo said in the press release.
“The Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely critical, and the passage of this legislation is beyond overdue,” she said in a statement.
Reporter James Brooks of the Alaska Beacon and Editor Christina Lords of the Idaho Capital Sun contributed to this report.","After letting funding lapse for nearly two years, Congress voted to renew crucial federal funding that rural counties and schools have counted on for a quarter century.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday evening voted 399-5 to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act through September 2026, and to provide lapsed payments for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. The vote came after a year-long campaign led by bipartisan federal lawmakers from the West, including Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo.

The U.S. Senate in June unanimously voted to reauthorize the act. It now goes to the president to be signed into law.

“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I’m relieved the House has finally done its job with the long-overdue passage of my bill to return the safety net for critical services to communities that need it the most.”

Wyden co-authored the original law that provided tens of millions each year for rural schools and communities that previously benefited from revenue generated by natural resource industries on public lands. Since then, it has provided $7 billion in payments to more than 700 counties and 4,400 school districts across 40 states and Puerto Rico that have large swaths of federal land within their borders.

In Idaho, $22.8 million was distributed across 34 counties to help pay for educational programs, emergency response systems and other services in Fiscal Year 2023, according to a press release from Crapo’s office.

“The SRS program is vital to maintaining schools, roads and emergency response services in rural, forested counties,” Crapo said in the press release. “We have a responsibility to these communities who house large swaths of untaxable federal land. The passage of this legislation will provide retroactive pay to counties that faced deep cuts since the program’s expiration at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 and restore funding levels for FY 2026. I continue to press for a long-term solution to provide Idaho’s county governments with more certainty.”

Oregon, where more than half of the state consists of federal land, has experienced the biggest loss of any state since the funding lapsed in 2023: nearly $48.7 million in money for rural roads, public services and schools, according to a September report from the D.C.-based Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy and think tank. Idaho has missed out on $21.3 million, Alaska more than $12.6 million and Washington more than $14.7 million.

Overall, states have lost out on more than $207 million in the two years since the act expired, the Center for American Progress found.

U.S. House hasn’t voted on Secure Rural Schools funding after bill passed the Senate

Twice since December 2024, the Senate has voted to renew the act in an effort led by Wyden and Idaho’s senior U.S. Sen. Crapo, a Republican.

But each time the Senate approved it, the House failed to take a vote. The bill lapsed in 2023 and counties haven’t gotten payments since early 2024. House Republicans most recently failed to reauthorize the act in the tax and spending cut megalaw they passed in July, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

With just weeks before the House is due to wrap its work for the year, Wyden, Crapo and 83 bipartisan lawmakers from the Senate and the House sent a letter to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, urging them to take a vote on the act before they recessed.

Just 12 hours after receiving the letter, the House announced it would fast-track consideration and a vote on the bill.

Washington’s U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat representing southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, led the passage of the bill in the House.

“The Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely critical, and the passage of this legislation is beyond overdue,” she said in a statement. “Candidly, the only reason it took this long is because way too many folks in D.C. have been blissfully ignorant about how disastrous the lapse of SRS has been for timber communities in Southwest Washington and across the West. Schools have closed up, teachers have been laid off, and our kids have been left footing the bill for Congress’s neglect.”

Since the funding lapsed, schools in Skamania County in her district have laid off staff and a middle school was forced to close.

In Alaska, the failure to reauthorize the program caused rural school districts to cut their budgets, particularly in southeast Alaska, home to the vast Tongass National Forest.

Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, voted for the bill on Friday, and both of the state’s senators — Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — supported it as well.

Distillates rose by 1 million barrels yet overall experienced a decrease of 2.88 million barrels.","Gasoline prices are at the lowest level since 2021, making life more affordable—and seeing that “affordability” is a new favorite word of the left, that should be a major win. Of course, the left will point out that electricity prices have been soaring, but that is directly attributable to the record demand that has happened because of power centers and demand from artificial intelligence that is growing our economy and the lack of investment in infrastructure that occurred due to democrat overregulation and the push toward green energy.

The leftist energy policies pushing toward green energy resulted in higher regulatory costs and set the American power infrastructure back years. However, under President Trump, they are realizing that meeting this demand in the future is like the Manhattan Project, and they will get caught up

Funny how quickly the left forgets their promises of energy affordability. Remember President Biden’s much-hyped green energy push—centered on the 2024 Inflation Reduction Act and its $391 billion in so-called clean energy incentives—was supposed to make energy cheaper, cut emissions, and spark a jobs revolution. I am waiting!

Energy costs began to escalate when policies designed to incentivize renewables—such as tax credits for solar, wind, and electric vehicles—did not deliver the expected savings. I was shocked. Instead, gasoline prices rose sharply, with some states seeing costs exceed $5 per gallon in 2022. Utility bills also surged by 20 to 30 percent in states with a strong focus on renewables.

Billions of dollars were funneled into projects, like “climate-friendly ketchup” which might taste good and eminent domain actions and trying to make energy production more politically correct and threatening energy companies with lawsuits and pushing affirmative action in the industry. Grid reliability suffered as the Biden administration pushed for an aggressive net-zero emissions goal by 2050 and a fully clean grid by 2035. They pushed their aspirational goals at the expense of the American people and their so-called precious affordability.

The Biden administration had this fossil fuel fantasy that they could replace fossil fuels without reliable backup systems in place that also led to instability and blackouts in many energies markets. The inflation reduction ask also focused and renewable energy supports sources and funnel to realize the importance of energy storage causing delays and volatility in the electrical grid.

They destroyed incentives for reasonable expansions of the electric grid because of their focus on their pet green energy projects and with the administration supporting states that canceled pipelines oil pipelines trying to make new building with natural gas impossible it turned out to be a major disaster that raised inflation

Fossil fuels were phased out too quickly, before reliable backup systems were in place, leading to blackouts and instability in energy markets. The Inflation Reduction Act’s emphasis on intermittent renewable sources neglected the importance of energy storage, causing delays and volatility within the electrical grid.

Despite the focus on green policies, fossil fuels remained central to U.S. energy production, reaching record highs under Biden with 13 million barrels of oil produced per day by 2023, casting doubt on the feasibility of the administration’s emissions reduction targets. Meanwhile, job losses in the fossil fuel sector outpaced gains in green jobs—over 100,000 fossil fuel positions were lost due to permitting delays and EPA regulations, while about 300,000 new green jobs were created, but not distributed evenly across the country.

States like Pennsylvania and West Virginia—energy powerhouses—were hit hardest by the administration’s so-called “green pivot.” These are states where energy jobs keep families fed and local economies humming, but instead they faced the brunt of misguided policies. All those promises to “bring manufacturing home”?

What a scam! Sure, the subsidies spawned a handful of shiny electric vehicle battery plants, but the reality is that sky-high costs and China’s iron grip on critical supply chains meant average Americans never saw those benefits.

The bottom line: Biden’s green energy experiment made for a great press release but delivered little when it came to affordable, dependable energy. In the end, everyday Americans are still footing the bill—just check your gas pump and utility statement. The dream of cheap, clean energy? That’s still just a dream, not a reality. If anything, Biden’s policies have made it even harder for families to keep the lights on and their tanks full.

Yet it also is about President Trump foreign policy that has brought down gas prices. Yesterday Z- Man energy pointed out that President Trump has given President Zelensky a limited timeframe to respond to Russia’s proposed peace plan and is advocating for elections to be held in Ukraine. In response, Zelensky is preparing to present a European-backed peace plan tomorrow, indicating that with sufficient security guarantees, early elections could be feasible next year.

Energy prices are trying to make a comeback today after Monday’s massive sell-off and the continued pressure that followed. But let’s be clear—if you’re scanning those , there’s no sign of the oil glut everyone’s been buzzing about. Even the Energy Information Administration’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook hints at a landscape that could shift dramatically at any moment.

The API figures indicated that gasoline inventories increased by 7 million barrels, followed by a reduction of 3.1 million barrels. Distillates rose by 1 million barrels yet overall experienced a decrease of 2.88 million barrels. stocks declined by 4.8 million, an additional 1.7 million, and a further 2.48 million barrels. Cushing inventories also decreased by 0.89 million barrels. These trends suggest that expectations of oversupply may require reassessment.

The in their “Short-Term Energy Outlook is still looking for an oil glut. The EIA says that looking ahead, global oil inventories are expected to rise through 2026, which is likely to exert downward pressure on oil prices in the coming months. Brent crude oil prices are forecast to average $55 per barrel in the first quarter of 2026 and remain near that level throughout the year. Despite the anticipated decline in crude oil prices, OPEC+ production strategies and China’s ongoing inventory accumulation are projected to help limit further price reductions.

In the natural gas market, the Henry Hub spot price is expected to average almost $4.30 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) this winter—an increase of over 40 cents/MMBtu compared to last month’s projection—primarily due to colder-than-expected December weather driving up demand for space heating. However, milder weather anticipated in early 2026 and rising production are expected to moderate prices, with the Henry Hub price averaging around $4.00/MMBtu for the year.

In terms of electricity generation, U.S. power sector output is projected to grow by 2.4% in 2025 and by 1.7% in 2026. This marks a change from the relatively flat generation seen between 2010 and 2020, with the increase mainly attributable to higher demand from large customers such as data centers, particularly in areas managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and the PJM Interconnection. The forecast for generation growth in 2026 has been revised downward from last month’s outlook, based on the actual amount of large load electricity demand that has materialized so far this year.

Natural gas markets experienced an exciting ride as EBW Analytics highlighted a breakout rally late last week, with prices soaring to $5.496 on the back of frigid December forecasts that spurred robust short covering. Although prices dipped 94.5¢ to Tuesday’s low when weather models shifted to milder predictions, the stage looks set for a partial recovery in the near term, especially with daily heating demand expected to ramp up into the upcoming weekend.

Adding to the positive momentum, LNG exports have reached record highs while production has tapered off. This trend could further tighten core fundamentals as we head into mid-winter. While winter weather will be the primary driver for pricing and the recent market volatility may take time to stabilize, several upbeat factors—including a shrinking storage surplus compared to five-year averages, elevated LNG exports, supply freeze-off risks, a bullish market skew, and DTN’s outlook for a chilly January—all point toward a favorable medium-term outlook for natural gas prices according to EBW.

Fox Weather is generating excitement with its latest reports, indicating that the eastern U.S. could experience its first major snowstorm of the season this weekend, particularly along the Interstate 95 corridor—if the incoming cold air collides with moisture racing across the country. Current computer forecast model guidance will lead to snow arriving in the Midwest on Saturday and pushing into the Northeast by Sunday. Still, there’s considerable uncertainty regarding snowfall amounts and locations, so residents in the Midwest and Northeast should stay tuned for updated forecasts as the week unfolds.

The FOX Forecast Center adds to the anticipation, explaining that forecast models showing the Polar Vortex’s circulation weakening later this week into the weekend. This shift is expected to allow even more cold air to spill into the Midwest and Northeast, following record low temperatures already reported Tuesday in New England.

For context, the Polar Vortex is a large, persistent zone of low pressure and frigid air situated near the poles, about 10–30 miles above Earth’s surface. When the Polar Vortex is strong, the coldest air remains confined to the Arctic regions; but as it weakens, that bitter cold can plunge into the lower atmosphere. Dips in the Pacific jet stream then help funnel this Arctic air from Canada into the Lower 48, setting the stage for dramatic winter weather events.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 13:01:43.145316

Evers’ efforts to ensure Wisconsin’s kids and families have clean, safe drinking water is available here.","MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers, together with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR), today announced more than $159 million has been allocated for financial assistance through the Lead Service Line Replacement Program to 29 municipalities across the state to ensure Wisconsinites have access to clean, safe drinking water that is free of lead. The funding will help municipalities replace lead service lines, with a special focus on small and disadvantaged communities.

“There is no safe level of lead, period, and getting these harmful contaminants out of our water systems once and for all has been a top priority of my administration since Day One,” said Gov. Evers. “Wisconsin has been a national leader in spearheading lead service line replacement efforts, and thanks in part to the bipartisan, pro-kid 2025-27 Biennial Budget I signed earlier this year, in which we were able to increase borrowing for the Environmental Improvement Fund by over $730 million to help meet statewide demand for low-interest financing for clean water and safe drinking water loans, dozens of municipalities across the state are getting a much-needed boost to continue this important work.”

Passed by the U.S. Congress in 2021, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) included $50 billion for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to strengthen and rebuild the nation’s water infrastructure. This historic investment provided $15 billion for lead service line identification and replacement nationwide.

A subprogram of the federal Safe Drinking Water Loan Program, the Lead Service Line Replacement Program, utilizing federal BIL funding, provides funding to municipalities for both public and private lead service line replacements and related lead service line inventory work to protect public health. Since the first version of the Lead Service Line Replacement Program began in state fiscal year 2017, the DNR and the Wisconsin Department of Administration have provided more than $267 million in financial assistance to Wisconsin municipalities for lead service line replacement projects. Additional information about the current Lead Service Line Replacement Program can be found online here.

“Every family, every business, every school, and every community needs to know when they turn on their tap, it’s clean water coming out. Sadly, that is just not the case in too many of our communities, and the consequences of lead poisoning, especially for our children, are dire,” said U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin). “That’s why I am so proud to have voted for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to replace dangerous lead pipes, delivering clean water to families across the state and creating good-paying jobs in the process.”

Funding requested for the current cycle totaled over $182 million. Any project that was not fully funded will be offered base Safe Drinking Water Loan Program funds that will be at the standard subsidized loan interest rate at either 55 percent or 33 percent of the market rate, rather than the 0.25 percent rate offered for loan funds from the BIL Lead Service Line capitalization grant. See the DNR’s Interest Rates webpage for more information.

According to the DNR, throughout the state, there are more than 132,000 known public side lead service lines, more than 128,000 known private side lead service lines, and more than 208,000 service lines of unknown composition that may contain lead. This funding will help municipalities continue their efforts toward the goal of replacing the remaining lead service lines.

Examples of preliminarily approved projects include:

Milwaukee | Over $50 million

The city of Milwaukee was allocated over $50 million in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which more than $19 million of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Racine | $40 million

The city of Racine was allocated $40 million in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which more than $21 million of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Manitowoc | Over $14 million

The city of Manitowoc was allocated over $14 million in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which nearly $7.3 million of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Oshkosh | Over $6 million

The city of Oshkosh was allocated over $6 million in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which more than $2.7 million of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Chippewa Falls | Over $1.9 million

The city of Chippewa Falls was allocated over $1.9 million in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which $957,750 of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Thorp | Over $733,000

The city of Thorp was allocated over $733,000 in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which more than $366,000 of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Rice Lake | $732,500

The city of Rice Lake was allocated $732,500 in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which nearly $550,000 of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

The 2026 Lead Service Line Replacement Program funding list is available here. Additional information on Lead Service Line Replacement funding is available here.

Gov. Evers has made efforts to replace lead service lines across the state a top priority. Earlier this year, Gov. Evers announced the Wisconsin Department of Health Services finalized a new rule, making permanent an emergency rule that the governor approved in January, to combat lead poisoning statewide by lowering the lead poisoning threshold to 3.5 µg/dL. By lowering the lead poisoning threshold, more kids and families will be eligible for lead poisoning and intervention resources, including education programming, screening, care coordination or follow-up services for kids not covered by a third-party payer, and other activities related to poisoning or exposure.

Additionally, the governor’s 2025-27 Biennial Budget proposal included an investment of more than $300 million to help get lead out of Wisconsinites’ pipes, bubblers, schools, homes, and child care centers for good. Unfortunately, Republicans in the Wisconsin State Legislature gutted the governor’s efforts to clean up lead, PFAS, and other harmful contaminants statewide and rejected hundreds of millions of dollars in investments to ensure kids, families, and farmers have access to safe and clean drinking water. Despite this setback, Gov. Evers maintains that replacing lead service lines and ensuring Wisconsinites have access to clean and safe water is essential.

ADDITIONAL EVERS ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS TO ENSURE WISCONSINITES HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN, SAFE DRINKING WATER

Gov. Evers declared 2019 the Year of Clean Drinking Water, and for the past six years, the governor has prioritized efforts to invest in clean water infrastructure and ensure Wisconsinites have access to safe, clean water statewide. Earlier this year, Gov. Evers declared 2025 the Year of the Kid in Wisconsin and announced several new efforts to address childhood lead poisoning and ensure clean drinking water for all, many of which were included in the 2025-27 bipartisan, pro-kid budget that the governor signed earlier this year.

To continue building upon the governor’s work to ensure Wisconsin’s kids and families have clean, safe drinking water, the 2025-27 Biennial Budget increases borrowing for the state’s Environmental Improvement Fund by $731.6 million to secure federal clean water and safe drinking water capitalization grants over the next four years. This will help meet the increasing demand from local communities who need support to upgrade local water systems and infrastructure to ensure every Wisconsin kid, family, and community has clean, safe drinking water.

In addition, the 2025-27 Biennial Budget provides:

$2 million for the development of a remedial action plan for the remediation of arsenic-contaminated sediment in the Kewaunee Marsh;

$4 million to be used for remedial action at the Amcast Superfund site;

$6 million in bonding to be used for the Kenosha Dunes restoration project;

$7.5 million for contaminated sediment removal from sites in the Great Lakes or its tributaries that are on Wisconsin’s impaired waters list to continue protecting this resource;

$4 million for Urban Nonpoint Source cost-sharing and the Municipal Flood Control Program;

$6.5 million to counties for capital projects that implement land and water resource management plans under the Targeted Runoff Management Program;

$7 million for grants to counties for implementation of land and water resource management plans, including cost-share grants to landowners that install conservation practices on their land, such as erosion prevention strategies, through the Soil and Water Resource Management Program;

$4 million for the repair, reconstruction, and removal of dams;

Over $1.8 million over the biennium to update the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources’ systems and improve customer service for Wisconsinites; and

More than $12 million to support county conservation staff around the state.

Additionally, Gov. Evers has been clear that his top priority in the 2025-27 Biennial Budget would be to pass a pro-kid budget that makes meaningful investments in Wisconsin’s kids at every stage and every age, from early childhood to K-12 to our higher education institutions, as well as ensuring kids and families have access to safe, clean drinking water. More information about the bipartisan pro-kid budget signed by Gov. Evers is available here. More on Gov. Evers’ efforts to ensure Wisconsin’s kids and families have clean, safe drinking water is available here.",https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WisPoliticsIconSocial.png,N,,2025-12-10 15:01:32.246736

About Empire State Development","Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that People Center, Inc., d/b/a Rippling, a leading workforce management software company, will again expand its New York City operations, creating 371 new full-time jobs and expanding its presence in Manhattan. Empire State Development (ESD) is supporting the company’s expansion with up to $3.4 million in performance-based Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits in exchange for job creation and continued investment in New York.

“New York continues to be the place where innovative companies choose to grow, hire and invest,” Governor Hochul said. “By once again expanding its footprint in Manhattan and creating hundreds of new jobs, Rippling is strengthening New York City’s position as a global technology hub and contributing to our state’s fast-growing innovation economy.”

Rippling plans to relocate from its current office at 4 World Trade Center to a larger space at 330 West 34th Street, expanding its New York footprint to more than 130,000 square feet. The company currently employs more than 500 people in New York City. This announcement builds on Empire State Development’s previous support for Rippling’s initial New York City expansion, when the company was awarded up to $3.5 million in Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits for the creation of 391 jobs — a goal that Rippling has already surpassed, growing its New York workforce faster than anticipated. That expansion helped establish Rippling’s New York office as a key hub for research and development.

Founded in 2016, Rippling has experienced tremendous growth and provides an all-in-one platform that helps businesses manage HR, IT, and finance functions from a single system.

Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, New York continues to attract the world’s most innovative companies. Rippling’s decision to expand in New York City reflects the strength of our tech ecosystem, the quality of our workforce, and our commitment to supporting businesses that drive economic growth and create good jobs.”

Rippling Co-Founder and CEO Parker Conrad said, “Most companies are stuck using a set of fragmented, siloed tools to run their business. It’s inefficient, it slows the company down, and it puts you at a real disadvantage with your competitors. Rippling solves this problem by helping companies manage and automate every part of the business across HR, IT and Finance with a single, unified system. Our clients run on Rippling so they can run their businesses with greater speed and clarity. We are grateful for the Governor’s support as we expand our team and footprint in NYC”

Empire State Development’s Excelsior Jobs Program provides performance-based tax credits to businesses in targeted industries — including technology, life sciences and advanced manufacturing — that create jobs or make significant capital investments in New York State.

Rippling’s expansion builds on a series of major technology-sector investments supported by ESD in recent years — including those by companies like Bilt and Figma — reinforcing New York’s leadership in innovation and digital growth.

New York’s Growing Tech Economy

New York’s tech sector continues to be one of the fastest-growing in the nation, adding tens of thousands of jobs and billions in venture investment each year. Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, New York State has gained over 34,000 new jobs in the technology industry, with New York City being home to more than 2,000 AI start-ups. Since the pandemic, the number of technology businesses in the state has increased by 27 percent to 31,000 businesses, and the New York City technology sector has added jobs at nearly 10 times the rate of the city’s overall economy.

The €220 million development will be important both locally and nationally, creating 2000 long-term jobs for the region, while also supporting the country’s renewable energy targets. Located at Rosslare Europort in County Wexford, the project will transform Rosslare Harbour into Ireland’s primary base for the construction, operation, and maintenance of offshore wind farms in the Irish and Celtic Seas.

The development represents a key step in meeting Ireland’s renewable energy targets and in positioning the southeast region at the forefront of the new green economy. The government has committed to achieving at least 5 GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030; Rosslare ORE Hub will have the potential to support the installation of approximately 0.5 GW to 1 GW of offshore wind capacity each year.

Subject to planning being granted and funding allocated, Iarnród Éireann aims to commence construction in early 2027, with delivery targeted for early 2029.

Chief Executive of Iarnród Éireann, Mary Considine, said: “The Rosslare ORE Hub marks a once in a generation investment in Ireland’s clean energy future, integrating national transport and maritime infrastructure to unlock offshore wind potential and deliver sustainable growth for coastal communities. It will also be a significant boost for the South East, creating jobs in an emerging and vital industry, and becoming a crucial asset in Ireland’s energy transition journey.”

Spanning 80 ha., the Rosslare ORE Hub will include two new heavy lift berths specifically designed for offshore renewable energy components, extensive areas for storage, marshalling and assembly and a new 64-berth, small boat harbour. The project also includes new access roads, utilities, environmental enhancements and facilities for local marine users, including the Rosslare Sea Scouts.

The planned works comprise 50 ha. of dredging, 32 ha. of land reclamation, including the creation of 19.7 ha. of new port lands capable of handling the largest wind turbine components. These facilities will enable Rosslare to serve multiple offshore wind projects underway in the Irish and Celtic Seas and deliver long-term economic and employment benefits to County Wexford and the southeast.

Glenn Carr, Director Commercial Business Units with Iarnród Éireann, Port Authority for Rosslare Europort, added: “Lodging planning for Rosslare’s ORE Hub is a significant milestone in the development of this critical piece of infrastructure that will support the development, growth and long-term operation of the offshore wind industry in Ireland’s South East region. Delivering this nationally significant infrastructure will support the continued expansion Rosslare Europort, strengthen the local economy, support local employment and deliver on national and EU policy priorities.”

The project, which is owned by Iarnród Éireann, has also been co-funded to planning stage by the EU Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The 2000 jobs created by Rosslare ORE Hub will span port construction, offshore wind construction activity and long-term operation and maintenance phases of offshore wind development.

Work is currently underway on approximately 27 hectares to create access roads and transport routes across the hilly forest area. Foundations are scheduled to be laid from May 2026, allowing the turbines to be installed in the last quarter of 2026.

With a total capacity of 18 MW, the turbines are expected to supply electricity for around 25,000 people, roughly one-third of Arnsberg’s population. Commercial operation is planned for spring 2027.

According to VSB, the location within the “Arnsberger Wald” protected landscape presents particular challenges for technical planning and environmental protection. The company welcomes the agreement with the local conservation authority and regional forestry offices on compensation measures and the promotion of resilient mixed deciduous forests. Approximately 70,000 square meters of site-appropriate deciduous forest will be newly planted.

In addition to supplying clean energy, the wind park will also benefit the city of Arnsberg economically. VSB shares 0.2 euro cents per kilowatt-hour generated with municipalities under § 6 of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). “Few regions illustrate as clearly as the Hochsauerland how closely nature, quality of life and the energy transition are interconnected.

Leveraging social behavior factors of pregnant women in Louisiana and in vivo models to study the impact of maternal vaping on birth outcomes and asthma in offspring

Goal: Identify the relationship between pregnancy intent, maternal vaping, and birth outcomes, including in an in vivo model to assess prenatally exposed offspring’s risk of developing chronic lung disease and asthma. Develop preventive and interventional strategies.

Wins: The team discovered that different sociodemographic characteristics, stress, and health conditions shape the use of cigarettes versus e-cigarettes before and during pregnancy. They also highlight the importance of complete cessation for improving birth outcomes and suggest e-cigarette use may follow different behavioral and social patterns than traditional smoking. Cigarette use during pregnancy was associated with lower socio-economic status, whereas e-cigarette use was not. While in an experimental model, prenatal exposure to e-cigarettes also reduced birth weight and decreased lung function. Overall, this study emphasizes the need for tailored public-health messaging that both promotes cessation and addresses the emerging dynamics of e-cigarette use during pregnancy.

What’s next? Continue to analyze the in vivo experiments to look at dust-mite-induced asthma and how it impacts the lungs of offspring exposed prenatally to e-cigarettes.

Wins: The team has designed, manufactured, and validated sensor systems, including custom-printed circuit boards cast in silicone, with optional placement in players’ helmets, chinstraps, and handwarmers. A 3D brain model was also successfully developed to simulate brain deformation under repeated impacts.

What’s next? Work with two Baton Rouge-area high school football teams—Catholic High School and St. Michael High School—on potential implementation.

On the team: Genevieve Palardy, Hunter Gilbert, Robert Herbert, and Andrew Becnel (LSU Mechanical and Industrial Engineering), Kshitiz Upadhyay (Aerospace Engineering & Mechanics at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities), and Dr. Shannon Alwood, Greggory Davis, Dr. Richard Lewis, and Dr. Michael Truax Jr. (LSU Health New Orleans, Our Lady of the Lake).

Preventing childhood obesity through AI-assisted behavioral counseling

Goal: Combat childhood obesity, as the state of Louisiana has one of the highest obesity rates in the nation with 40% among adults and 22% among children. Use geographic information systems, or GIS, to map disparities in childhood obesity risk across Louisiana communities. Conduct a clinical trial with Louisiana adolescents to test the effect of the LSU-built ProudMe program (Preventing Obesity Using Digital-assisted Movement and Eating) over a summer.

Wins: The team has completed its mapping of childhood obesity and obesity risk in Louisiana and found significant disparities related to walkability, park access, and food environments across Louisiana communities. The researchers have successfully developed the ProudMe app to enable AI-assisted health behavior management for adolescents. They conducted a pilot trial of the ProudMe summer intervention in 2025 (it was a two-week, half-day summer camp followed by digital self-monitoring and engagement with parents over five weeks). The camp made a clear impact on participants’ weight (i.e. waist circumference).

What’s next? Recruit a larger sample with random group assignments in summer 2026. Improve the ProudMe app user experience. Focus on removing barriers to post-camp lifestyle changes. Make campers’ summer days more structured. Leverage the research findings to compete for larger NIH grant funding.

On the team: Senlin Chen (LSU Kinesiology), Amanda Staiano (Pennington Biomedical), Fahui Wang (LSU Geography and Anthropology), David Shepherd (LSU Computer Science & Engineering), Dr. Stewart Gordon (Louisiana Healthcare Connections), Dr. Katie Queen (Our Lady of the Lake Children’s Health).

That marked a 45% decline year-on-year and made stationary storage the lowest-priced segment for the first time ever.
The research firm’s Energy Storage Market Outlook Report for the first half of 2025, published in October, forecasted an estimated 92GW/247GWh of energy storage, excluding pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) deployments, worldwide for this year.
Both average battery pack price and turnkey system costs saw their biggest falls since 2017 between 2023-2024.
Chinese manufacturers intensify competition, 3% fall predicted for 2026 There continue to be significant differences among regions: China saw the largest decline in average battery pack prices (13%), followed by Europe (8%).","Those metal price increases, particularly for cobalt, will have affected the electric vehicle (EV) segments more than the stationary battery energy storage system (BESS) segment, where an almost total switchover to lithium iron phosphate (LFP) from nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) or similar sub-chemistries has eliminated the BESS market’s dependence on cobalt.

Indeed, where EV battery cost reductions in 2024 were hailed as a breakthrough that meant that, at US$97/kWh average pack prices, battery vehicles were at cost parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in China and expected to follow elsewhere, this year BNEF reported a global average of US$99/kWh for battery EV (BEV) packs in 2025.

BNEF assessed 320 data points from across passenger EVs, e-buses, commercial EVs, two- and three-wheeler vehicles and stationary energy storage.

Stationary storage now the lowest-cost segment

Stationary energy storage, in fact, saw the most significant drop in price of any segment, with average battery pack prices found to be just US$70/kWh globally. That marked a 45% decline year-on-year and made stationary storage the lowest-priced segment for the first time ever.

This was due to growing competition in China and the country’s commensurate “massive overcapacity for battery cells specifically aimed at stationary storage applications,” the authors wrote, which was a significant driver of aggressive cost reductions.

BNEF said China currently has an estimated 557GWh annual stationary energy storage cell production capacity, which is roughly double the global demand in the sector.

The research firm’s Energy Storage Market Outlook Report for the first half of 2025, published in October, forecasted an estimated 92GW/247GWh of energy storage, excluding pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) deployments, worldwide for this year.

That said, the stationary storage industry will likely be keeping an eye out for a separate annual BNEF report, the Battery Storage System Cost Survey, which examines the entire system-level prices of turnkey BESS equipment worldwide.

Expected early in the New Year, the system cost survey last year found a 40% fall from 2023 numbers to US$165/kWh in 2024 (ESN Premium article). Both average battery pack price and turnkey system costs saw their biggest falls since 2017 between 2023-2024.

The average cost for a turnkey system in China in 2024 was just US$101/kWh (1-hour, 2-hour and 4-hour duration BESS). In the US, the average was US$236/kWh and in Europe US$275/kWh, and so it will be interesting to compare this year’s battery pack price data with system-level costs when they are published.

Chinese manufacturers intensify competition, 3% fall predicted for 2026

There continue to be significant differences among regions: China saw the largest decline in average battery pack prices (13%), followed by Europe (8%). North American pack prices fell just 4% year-on-year.

With Chinese exports to the US restricted by changes in both domestic US policy and international tariff disputes, Chinese manufacturers are shifting export volumes to Europe instead, which BNEF said intensified price competition in Europe.

The adoption of LFP, which is also becoming more common for shorter-range EVs where energy density is less important than cost, helped absorb the higher cost of metals, as did long-term contracts and other hedging strategies.

The lowest LFP cell price BNEF found was US$36/kWh and the lowest LFP pack price US$50/kWh, similar to numbers for last year and evidence, the researchers said, that low-cost products are not outliers in LFP.

After the temporary 2021-2022 pandemic-era reversal of cost declines, contracting supply deals with prices indexed to the cost of raw materials became more common, as did increased diversification of supply chains.

Although the metal price increases did not translate into higher costs for cells or packs, BNEF expects high cobalt, lithium, and nickel costs to exert pressure on manufacturer margins. While most manufacturers will be able to absorb and ride out the impacts in the near term, a persistent elevation of metal prices would likely result in short-term price rises.

For 2026, BNEF predicts a 3% decline in pack price across all segments, resulting in an average of just under US$105/kWh. Raw material price pressures are likely to persist, but the increased adoption of lower cost LFP will help drive next year’s falling price dynamics, BNEF said.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CATL-indonesia-fatory-rendering.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 12:00:51.703054

PETERSBURG, Fla. – Today, Duke Energy Florida announced the completion of two new solar energy sites: Half Moon Renewable Energy Center in Sumter County and Rattler Renewable Energy Center in Hernando County.

Why it matters

Expanding solar energy helps displace the cost of fuel, like natural gas, that would otherwise be needed to generate electricity. This creates savings for customers because the price Duke Energy Florida pays for fuel is a direct pass-through cost reflected on their bills.

The two solar sites each produce 74.9 megawatts (MW) of clean energy that have been added to the electric grid, saving the company’s 2 million customers an estimated $500 million over their service lifetimes.

These sites are part of the first phase of an agreement with the Florida Public Service Commission to build 12 new solar sites between 2025 and 2027. Together, these 12 sites will create 900 MW of energy and save customers a total of approximately $3 billion throughout their service lifetimes.

Our view

“Our customers are the motivation for our ongoing solar energy expansion – as they are for everything we do, every day,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. “Each new solar site creates considerable savings for them, while diversifying and strengthening our generation fleet, ensuring we’re delivering on our commitment to providing safe, reliable energy at the lowest price possible.”

Zoom out

Duke Energy Florida currently owns, operates and maintains a portfolio of more than 30 solar energy sites across the state that contribute approximately 1,700 MW to the system.

By the end of 2033, Duke Energy Florida projects to have over 6,100 MW of utility-scale solar generating capacity online.

Duke Energy Florida

Duke Energy Florida, a subsidiary of Duke Energy, owns 12,300 megawatts of energy capacity, supplying electricity to 2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers across a 13,000-square-mile service area in Florida.

America has been the only nation in the world that has been actively rolling back permits for renewable energy projects, such as the federal government cancelling funding for a green hydrogen hub in California. Despite these ups and downs in the embrace of the sector, Coastal Virginia’s 2.6 GW offshore wind project remains on track to be completed by the end of next year.

Dominion Energy notes that the Coastal Virginia offshore wind project remains on schedule

Dominion Energy has stated that the project remains on track for a 2026 completion date. The project underscores the significant challenges in the US energy market for wind energy projects. This can be attributed to the apparent disdain that the current administration has for renewable energy generation, with wind power in particular aggravating President Donald Trump.

Dominion provides a stable energy supply for millions of customers in the Carolinas and Virginia, and has been working exceedingly hard to find an amicable solution to advance renewable energy projects in the United States. In Q3 of 2025, Dominion’s electric sales rose to $921 million, which is slightly more than the previous year, which came in at around $836 million.

The astonishingly huge offshore wind project will reshape the regional energy supply

Due to the fact that the US federal government has been actively rolling back permits for renewable energy projects, the 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project stands as a pillar of strength in a nation that has become exceedingly hard to operate wind projects in, or even get them past the planning phase. Once completed in late 2026, the project will be the largest offshore wind development in the United States by a long shot.

2026 will see the first electricity delivered to customers from the wind farm

During a recent earnings call, Dominion’s leadership noted that the project will begin delivering first electrons next year, with a full-scale launch expected by the end of 2026. Dominion’s CEO, Robert Blue, noted that while expectations are for the project to be completed by late next year, the installation of the final wind turbine may slip into early 2027.

Blue also noted during the earnings call that the total project costs are estimated to come in at around $11.2 billion, and include an unused contingency of $206 million. Due to the tariff situation in the global market, costs may increase next year by an astonishing $690 million. Despite the uncertainty of the estimated costs associated with the project, Blue notes that the project could save up to $3 billion for customers during its first decade of operations. Wind power generation has swept across the entire energy biosphere, with Europe embracing it like a long-lost family member.

“It’s the fastest way to get 2.6 GW on the grid that’s going to serve AI and technology companies, defense and security installations. It’s critical to important infrastructure upgrades at the Oceana Naval Air Station. And if you stop it now, it causes energy inflation.” – Dominon CEO, Robert Blue

Advancements in wind energy generation technology have reshaped global sentiments

While the United States faces an uncertain future in the renewable energy market, other regions of the world have taken a much more welcoming approach to the sector. Substantial advancements in wind energy technology have become a regular occurrence in the modern-day energy market and could potentially reshape the global adoption of the sector. The US will need to rethink its strategy for the renewable energy sector if it aims not to be left behind by the progress made in implementing new wind and other renewable energy projects in the future.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/45.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 12:02:36.441126

In a national survey of 1,000 likely voters, with an oversample of Black and Latino voters, 83% of respondents reported that their energy costs had increased over the last few years.

That’s near unanimous concern, regardless of race, political affiliation, or education. Over half (51%) of respondents say energy costs have increased a lot, while just 11% say they’ve stayed the same

Environmental advocates say that renewable energy alone can lower prices. The White House plan to slash bills relies on limiting electricity production to a ‘some of the above’ strategy with coal at its center. Americans aren’t buying either strategy.

On Electricity, Americans Want Fossil Fuels AND Clean Energy

Our research shows that a majority (59%) thinks a mix of clean energy and fossil fuels is best for the United States’s electricity sector. Most respondents have a favorable view of clean energy, including wind and solar (68%), as well as natural gas (73% favorable). Favorability of clean energy climbs to 76% when nuclear is included alongside wind and solar. Even oil and petroleum are above water, with 58% favorable and 35% unfavorable.

Partisanship does alter support for individual energy technologies, but not as much as one might think—59% of Democrats are favorable to natural gas, and 54% of Republicans are favorable to clean energy, including nuclear, wind, and solar. Republican favorability decreases to 37%, however, when asked about clean energy, including just wind and solar, and excluding nuclear.

Though party leaders and ideologues might be purists about one technology or another, Americans aren’t. They’re practical, and they understand that a mix of energy sources is the best way to achieve reliable energy.

Clean Energy Today, Lower Costs…Some Day

An overwhelming majority of Americans believe building more energy in the US will lower energy costs (82%). A slightly smaller share believes the US building more clean energy specifically will cut costs (73%). At the most basic level, Americans understand that building more energy helps lower costs and increases reliability.

Perception varies across individual technologies. Americans see wind as the most expensive energy source on the market (20%), followed by oil (16%) and coal (13%). Solar is seen as the most affordable source (26%), followed by nuclear (22%).

Respondents were closely divided on the impact of doubling US wind and solar: 41% believed doubling deployment would lower the cost of electricity. 35% thought it would increase costs. Participants clearly understood the basics of supply and demand—more energy means lower prices. But they have serious concerns about the affordability of some clean energy technologies, and those tech-specific concerns impact the perception of clean energy writ large.

As a result, Americans don’t totally buy that simply building more clean energy leads to lower costs. They want fossil fuels in the mix.

It’s also important to note that Americans aren’t sure how or when they’ll see cost savings from clean energy. Only 37% anticipate short-term cost savings, while 25% anticipate no significant effect on costs in the near future. 57% say clean energy will cut electricity costs in the long term. Americans are desperate for cost savings, and saying clean energy buildout alone will deliver relief simply isn’t credible.

Americans Like Clean Energy—They Just Aren’t Motivated By It

In an open-ended question, 69% of respondents identified the primary advantage of clean energy as some form of environmental protection, like mitigating climate change or improving air and water quality. Only 13% offered lower energy costs as a central benefit, and 22% said clean energy offers no clear advantage.

It is unsurprising that so few respondents identified the economic benefits of clean technologies, given what they reported hearing about clean energy in the media and in their communities. Just 6% reported hearing that clean energy could bring down electricity costs, compared with 11% who’d heard recently about the high cost of clean energy or other economic downsides.

Zoom out a bit, and it’s clear clean energy advocates are losing the messaging war:

41% of respondents reported hearing negative messages about clean energy, focused on things like high costs, unreliability, and land use.

17% reported hearing about political opposition to clean energy.

Just 24% reported hearing anything positive about clean energy, including messages on environmental benefits.

25% said they’d heard nothing at all about clean energy recently.

Despite considerable effort from advocates to raise awareness of the economic benefits of clean energy, those messages aren’t breaking through. And environmental benefits simply aren’t a priority for most Americans.

When asked about their top priorities for elected officials today, just 2% of respondents listed addressing climate change. That includes only 3% of Democrats and 3% of Independents.

Even when we get more specific and ask about respondents’ priorities for electricity generation, environmental protection still fails to break through. 31% of respondents say reducing pollution and lowering carbon emissions should be the number one consideration when making electricity in the US. 69% of respondents list affordability, reliability, and energy independence as their top concerns for the energy sector. Independents feel similarly, with 67% choosing affordability, reliability, and independence as their top concerns for the energy sector. Even committed Democrats aren’t totally convinced: 52% of Democrats say environmental protection should be the top priority for the energy sector, compared to 48% who chose other priorities like affordability.

Americans understand that clean energy delivers environmental benefits. But they don’t yet grasp that clean tech delivers where it matters most to them: providing affordable, reliable, and secure electricity.

Next Steps: Doubling Down on Economic Benefits

Americans—especially those less convinced of clean energy’s benefits—need to hear more about how clean energy can lower costs and provide consistent, dependable electricity. In our research, we’ve found that the most effective messages for these audiences were:

“The cost of wind and solar energy is coming down, and they will be far cheaper in the long run than fossil fuels, as the wind blows and the sun shines for free. Meanwhile, the cost to mine and drill for oil, gas, and coal is only going up.”

“By building domestic supply chains for clean energy technologies, the U.S. can create stable, good-paying jobs in fast-growing industries, with new opportunities in communities across the United States.”

With Independents, our strongest message was:

“With growing data centers and AI taking huge amounts of power, we’re going to need more electricity than ever to power businesses and homes. We should be investing in every energy source that can get us the power we’ll need, including wind and solar.”

To grow support for clean energy, advocates should certainly emphasize these core messages. But they also need to be sure messaging is deployed across media that Americans actually consume. 53% of survey respondents said they got most of their news from social media and podcasts, compared with 28% who consult national newspapers and their websites, and 34% who watch Fox, MSNBC, or other cable news.

Americans are strongly interested in relief from high energy prices. Clean energy can help, but only if advocates can make a credible case that it’s affordable and work to grow the coalition of supporters for clean energy deployment. That effort must go beyond good messaging and center on effective solutions that will lower costs now and create long-term stability. It’s not enough to talk about affordability. Policymakers and advocates must offer the public actionable solutions – and do what it takes to realize lower costs for working families.","https://uploads.thirdway.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=baseline-jpeg,quality=90,width=1200,height=630,fit=cover,gravity=auto/https://uploads.thirdway.org/products/all-of-the-above-poll-HG-G.jpg",N,,2025-12-10 11:02:48.669251

The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is the largest, spanning 113,000 acres, mostly in Chesapeake and Suffolk and stretching into North Carolina.","Last year, officials built a pavilion at one of the main entry points to the Great Dismal Swamp in Suffolk.

The project, funded through federal grants and private donors, transformed an empty field at the Jericho Lane entrance into a space for public events, including an amphitheater.

Over the past year, however, overgrowth has claimed much of the site, said Kay Adams, president of the nonprofit Friends of the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, which led the project.

Cuts to federal staffing and funding are likely to blame and she fears more are on the horizon.

“As a result of these cuts, those lands are no longer being maintained,” she said. “The assets are unusable by the public.”

The Friends has a partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help boost public access and conservation of the swamp, Adams said. It’s one of many conservation groups nationwide raising concerns about the impact of cuts under the Trump administration.

More than half of U.S. national wildlife refuges lack sufficient resources to carry out their missions, according to internal assessments conducted by the Fish and Wildlife Service and recently analyzed by the nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife.

President Trump has proposed cutting the National Wildlife Refuge System’s budget by at least 22%.

The system was already understaffed, starting in 2025 with 30% fewer employees than in 2010. Since Trump took office, the system has lost another quarter of its workforce.

It’s unclear how many staff have been impacted at the Dismal Swamp. The refuge’s central office and visitor contact station in Suffolk is now listed as open only 8 hours per week, down from 40.

Spokespeople for the Fish and Wildlife Service’s Northeast region, which includes Virginia, did not respond to WHRO’s request for comment.

Hampton Roads is home to several national wildlife refuges, including Back Bay in Virginia Beach, the Nansemond River in Suffolk, Plum Tree Island in Poquoson and the Eastern Shore.

The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is the largest, spanning 113,000 acres, mostly in Chesapeake and Suffolk and stretching into North Carolina. It’s the last vestige of a swamp that once covered more than a million acres.

The land contains more than 40 miles of trails and is a habitat for about 47 species of mammals, 200 bird species, 96 butterfly species and trees, including Atlantic white cedar, which is relatively rare because of logging and habitat loss.

The area also has extensive cultural and historical significance, including its role in supporting Indigenous tribes and serving as a refuge for “maroon” communities of enslaved people seeking freedom.

The National Park Service is studying a potential National Heritage Area centered around the swamp, which Congress would need to approve.

Adams said her nonprofit received grants through several federal agencies, including one in collaboration with Old Dominion University. This year, the money was canceled, withdrawn or paused indefinitely.

“A year and a half ago, we were operating with a grant portfolio in excess of $500,000,” she said. “That has now dropped to zero.”

Friends of the Great Dismal Swamp had to halt several education initiatives, such as hosting fourth-graders on field trips to the swamp and developing an environmental science curriculum for Suffolk Public Schools.

Adams said she hopes funding will eventually be restored, but in the meantime, the nonprofit aims to move forward by “marshaling resources from nontraditional areas.”

Local high school and college students are helping to document changes at the swamp in the wake of federal cuts, starting with a hike at the refuge last week. They plan to share the results with the public.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/94fda70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2F5c%2F58034f1f49c6a0d1d9414b4c4698%2Fimg-2587.JPG,N,,2025-12-10 11:05:00.363039

GREENVILLE, N.C. (12/09/2025) — East Carolina University’s Dr. Robert Hughes, associate professor in the Department of Chemistry, is the recipient of a $720,000 NCInnovation research grant for his project, “Cleaner, Safer Coatings for Marine and Industrial Equipment.”

Marine vessels — from fishing boats to research ships — struggle with fouling: the buildup of algae, barnacles and sludge that slows vessels down and increases fuel costs. Industrial bilge areas face similar problems, often requiring harsh chemical cleaners.

The goal of Hughes’ project is to develop environmentally friendly coatings that prevent this buildup without relying on toxic substances. By reducing drag and improving cleanliness, these coatings can help vessels operate more efficiently and minimize environmental impact. Industrial users may also benefit from coatings that require less maintenance and fewer harsh chemicals.

“I’m excited to work on a project that has a potentially high impact on our region of North Carolina,” Hughes said. “One of the things I love about eastern N.C. is our ease of access to recreational boating. This project could benefit the industry and the people of eastern NC.”

“Biofouling is an ongoing challenge for commercial and recreational boaters that is costly and requires frequent maintenance and reduces boating performance,” Hughes said. “Some of the most effective solutions against biofouling are currently being phased out because they also have negative environmental impacts.”

Over the next two years, Hughes will use the grant funds to advance the technology that will support the development, evaluation and commercial readiness of environmentally friendly marine and industrial paint. These products will assist in reducing biofouling and chemical buildup, and help vessels and coastal industries operate more efficiently while protecting workers and aquatic ecosystems.

“Dr. Hughes’s research has exciting applications for marine vessel maintenance, potentially impacting everything from research ships to ﬁshing boats,” said Michelle Bolas, NCInnovation’s interim CEO. “NCInnovation helps universities advance research with just this kind of real-world application, strengthening the university-to-industry pipeline that’s central to American competitiveness.”

NCInnovation helps university innovations advance toward commercialization by supporting university applied research through the critical research and development phase between proof of concept and readiness for the private market. NCInnovation’s grant funding is part of a larger effort to support the development and commercialization of university research in North Carolina. Learn more at NCInnovation.org.

Natural gas turbulence The good news is that after jumping on Friday, natural gas prices have tumbled 13% this week.
Households that use natural gas for heating are expected to experience a 3% jump in heating prices this winter, according to the EIA.","New York (CNN) — A new problem is threatening to worsen the affordability squeeze this winter: Natural gas prices have raced back up just as extreme cold forces Americans to crank up the heat.

President Donald Trump has said he’s focused on lowering energy prices. And the most visible energy price for most Americans, gasoline at the pump, has been a clear bright spot on the cost-of-living front.

But the progress on gas prices could be offset by the 39% spike in natural gas futures since the end of September. Natural gas recently climbed to the highest level since December 2022 before retreating sharply this week.

It’s a double whammy for consumers.

First, natural gas is the most common way to heat homes in America. The higher natural gas prices go, the more expensive it will be for many families to stay warm this winter.

Secondly, natural gas is by far the No. 1 fuel source powering the nation’s electric grid. Higher natural gas prices could exacerbate the sticker shock consumers are already experiencing when they open their electric bills.

“All that money the consumer is saving on gasoline may be eaten up by the soaring price of natural gas,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates.

Natural gas turbulence

The good news is that after jumping on Friday, natural gas prices have tumbled 13% this week.

Still, even at current levels, natural gas is nearly 50% more expensive than at this point last year.

Natural gas prices are extremely volatile, and analysts say it’s unclear at this point whether prices will continue to retreat or resume their recent climb.

Government forecasts don’t expect natural gas to crash back to earth anytime soon.

The Energy Information Administration ramped up its natural gas price forecast by about 10% on Tuesday from its November forecast, citing the “cold snap” in the United States that will drive up demand for heating.

After averaging just $2.19 per million BTU in 2024, the EIA expects natural gas to average $3.56 this year and $4.01 in 2026.

It takes time for those higher natural gas prices to filter through to Americans’ utility bills.

Households that use natural gas for heating are expected to experience a 3% jump in heating prices this winter, according to the EIA. That’s despite the fact that consumption is expected to be 2% lower.

The biggest price hikes are expected in the Northeast (4%) and the Midwest (7%), whereas heating costs in the West are forecasted to be flat and down 3% in the South.

Electricity prices are already rising fast

This isn’t just a wintertime problem.

Higher natural gas prices will contribute to higher electric bills.

According to federal data, natural gas accounts for about 40% of US electricity generation – more than the next two fuel sources, coal and nuclear, combined.

Electricity prices have already been rising sharply.

Residential electricity prices increased by 7.4% over the 12 months ending in September, the most recent month federal data is available. That’s more than twice the rate of inflation.

But the sticker shock is even greater in certain states, including Virginia (9%) and New Jersey (21%), two states where Democrats seized upon the issue in key gubernatorial wins last month.

‘Burned badly before’

So why is natural gas getting more expensive?

Part of the problem is supply.

Analysts say natural gas producers, especially public ones, have been apprehensive to ramp up production out of fear they’ll cause a supply glut that crashes prices.

“They’ve been burned badly before. No one wants that to happen again. There is a certain degree of reluctance,” said Robert Yawger, commodity specialist at Mizuho Securities.

Another factor: cheap oil.

Natural gas is a byproduct of drilling for crude oil. But oil drilling has slowed in recent months because crude is relatively inexpensive. That means so-called associated natural gas could take a hit. (Of course, cheap oil has helped keep a lid on prices for homes that rely on home heating oil to stay warm.)

Exports and AI boost demand

On the demand side, a relatively new phenomenon is that a significant chunk of natural gas produced in the United States is getting shipped overseas as liquified natural gas (LNG).

The EIA expects LNG exports to average 16.3 billion cubic feet per day next year, up 37% from 2024.

LNG exports are helping to supply US allies with relatively inexpensive energy, including European nations attempting to wean themselves off Russian gas.

But that also leaves less natural gas for Americans.

“That’s obviously contributing. These are molecules going overseas that were historically going to the consumer in the United States,” said Yawger, who estimates about 15% to 20% of the natural gas is getting exported.

New LNG export facilities are being built and slated to come online soon, potentially adding to demand.

Yawger emphasized that, at the end of the day, there’s no risk of running out of natural gas. If Americans need to produce more natural gas, it can be done relatively quickly.

But it could take a period of higher prices to encourage that production.

Another factor on the demand side: Artificial intelligence.

The data centers that act as the brains of the AI boom are sucking up enormous amounts of power – including natural gas.

“This is demand that I don’t think the market really anticipated as recently as a year ago,” said Patrick Rau, senior vice president of research and analysis at Natural Gas Intelligence.",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10/thermostat-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:05:09.775206

Judge Patti B. Saris vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.
They say they have invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but did not halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.
The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.","A federal judge in Boston on Dec. 8 struck down President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was arbitrary and capricious and violates U.S. law.

Judge Patti B. Saris vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York AG Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Her 47-page decision is New York, et al. v. Trump, et al., Lawyers Weekly No. 02-653-25.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

AG Andrea J. Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said on Dec. 8 that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump’s order argued that Trump lacks the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they have invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but did not halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William G. Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States’ largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10 percent of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,” she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2025/09/AP25235584078133.webp,N,,2025-12-10 12:02:52.830982

With the BrightDrop electric van now discontinued, dealers want them out of the door–fast.

Huge discounts are offered, which go as high as $29,000 in some cases.

Chevrolet has stopped making the BrightDrop electric van, which means the number of competitors for Rivian’s electric van has gone down by one. But it also means that Chevy dealers are pretty desperate to get rid of the remaining inventory, so there are some fantastic deals to be had for those who are looking for a solid, battery-powered commercial vehicle made by General Motors.

Whether you need a simple van for your business or you’re planning on converting one into a home on wheels for that #vanlife, there are some huge discounts on brand-new vehicles, so look carefully at your local dealers, and you might just find the right one.

Probably the biggest discount in the country right now is a whopping $29,000 for a 2025 Chevrolet BrightDrop 400 with zero miles on the clock, and it’s offered by Bomnin Chevrolet in Miami, Florida, as spotted by Carscoops. With the discount, the van retails for just $40,435–a drop of almost 42% over the original price.

This particular van is a front-wheel drive model with the standard range battery pack, so it has a total output of 233 horsepower and 300 pound-feet of torque, while the official range rating is 177 miles on a full charge. Speaking of charging, the BrightDrop 400 can take in up to 120 kilowatts from a DC fast charger, so it’s not exactly lightning-fast, but for this price, it’s still a great deal.

But this is not the only big discount out there–many like it are available across the country. Chevrolet of Troy, Ohio, has a similar BrightDrop 400 in stock, with the same $29,000 discount on the hood, but the final price is even lower–$39,995.

If an all-wheel drive model or the larger BrightDrop 600 is more to your liking, then expect to pay $21,500 less than the MSRP, as that’s the main dealer discount that’s offered across the board until Jan. 2, 2026. A brand new 2026 Chevy BrightDrop 400 dual-motor is currently on sale for $60,035 at Kelley Chevrolet in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Similarly, a $50,575 BrightDrop 600 AWD is being sold by Simpson Chevrolet of Garden Grove, California.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, though. According to Chevrolet’s online work truck locator, there are almost 3,000 BrightDrop vans in stock at dealerships, so there’s plenty to choose from. As a reminder, the top-spec model with the biggest battery has a maximum driving range of 272 miles, so it’s not just an urban runabout.

A few independent outfitters have been using the BrightDrop van as a base for custom-made RVs, but if affordability is the name of the game, camping wannabes might want to go at it alone and modify a cut-price BrightDrop to their liking–potentially saving tens of thousands of dollars in the process. The cheapest ready-made BrightDrop-based RV, the Coachmen RVEX, starts from $150,000 and goes all the way up to $200,000 for the top-spec model. Meanwhile, the Grounded G3 starts from $165,000 and tops out at $200,000.

While the BrightDrop is no longer being manufactured, most–if not all–of the models that rolled off the assembly line in Canada are still covered by an eight-year warranty that’s backed up by General Motors, so customers should be covered if anything goes wrong.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/0eW4mW/s1/2025-chevrolet-brightdrop-600.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 09:59:29.622440

The document calls for policies benefiting low-income customers, like discounts and a summertime shutoff ban, along with changes to state oversight and regulations.

“Hoosier families are stretched thin, and they need relief now from monopoly utilities who’ve pushed policies for years that led to this crisis,” said Megan Robertson, the executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters, a clean environment and energy group.

“This plan gives state leaders a clear, practical path to lower bills that will protect Hoosiers most in need and build a more affordable, reliable energy future for every community in our state,” she said.

About 87% of Hoosiers were at least “somewhat” concerned about rising energy costs — with 59% “very” concerned — in a Bellwether Research poll conducted for Indiana Conservation Voters.

The survey of 800 registered voters statewide was performed Oct. 29-30 and Nov. 1, over call and text, and carried an error margin of plus or minus 3.5%.

Robertson’s organization was joined by Citizens Action Coalition, a utility ratepayer watchdog.

“For too long, Hoosiers have been footing the bill for decisions they didn’t make and policies they didn’t ask for,” said Kerwin Olson, the coalition’s executive director.

“Indiana’s regulatory system should be built to protect consumers, but that goal can only be achieved if lawmakers give regulators the tools and authority it needs,” Olson said. “The solutions have been ready for years. The need is now incredibly urgent, and we hope lawmakers will do their part.”

The Indiana Energy Association, which represents the state’s largest electric and natural gas utilities, said the industry is “listening closely to customers, stakeholders, policymakers, and state leaders” as regular legislative work approaches.

“We recognize that many policy proposals will be considered this legislative session, and we share the concern for how the current landscape is affecting the people we serve,” association President Danielle McGrath said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “We remain committed to keeping energy reliable and affordable for our customers.”

She noted utilities already have some options for cash-strapped consumers.

“Beyond providing power, the industry plays a critical role in supporting our customers and communities. We offer a range of assistance and affordability tools that help manage costs and consumption, such as bill payment assistance, notifications and alerts, and flexible payment options,” McGrath said.

She added that Indiana’s residential energy prices are below the U.S. average and rank the lowest in the Earth North Central region — Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio — according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

The plan, however, indicated residents are still hard-hit.

“Hoosiers are paying some of the highest energy bills in the Midwest,” it read. “… Families, seniors, renters, small business owners — everyone is feeling the pain.”

White paper’s suggestions

Recommendations in the “Help Hoosiers Now Ratepayer Relief Plan” are ordered by “how quickly they will affect Hoosiers,” according to the document.

It centers on a pair of policies targeting low-income households.

Under the first, lawmakers would establish a discount rate for each of the state’s investor-owned utility companies, applicable to ratepayers who qualify as low-income. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission would set the rate, which the plan suggests could be based on a 3% or 4% income burden threshold. The concept is similar to the 30% of income standard often used for housing affordability.

The second would prohibit shutoffs during high summer temperatures for participants in Indiana’s low-income home energy assistance program. State law already bans shutoffs for such households during the winter, from Dec. 1 through March 15, according to the plan.

The organizations also aim to shake up the regulatory space. They recommended reforming IURC’s jurisdiction in mergers or acquisitions involving utilities or their parent firms.

BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners is close to purchasing AES Indiana, one of the “big five” investor-owned electric utility companies. Despite the potentially major implications, the state has no say, Axios Indianapolis reported.

Under other suggestions, lawmakers would require IURC to cap utility profit rates at the cost of capital and ban the commission from letting utilities include “political influence campaigns” in customer bills.

That would include activities related to lobbying, charitable giving, trade association expenses, litigation, investor relations and more. Utilities would file annual reports related to those activities, and the IURC would make them public.

Another proposal includes repealing or reducing cost trackers. Utilities can currently use them to adjust rates for certain expenses and recover those costs from customers on an ongoing basis.

Shrinking or getting rid of some trackers would “provide more stability in monthly bills and require utilities to go through the rate case process to pass along these costs,” the plan reads.

Other recommendations are longer-term endeavors.

That includes a revival of distributed energy generation policies, review of the state’s approach to controversial data centers and a requirement that big industrial energy-users participate in utility-led energy efficiency programs. They’d also help pay for the initiatives.

The plan additionally envisions a legislative confirmation process for IURC commissioners. The five members are appointed by the governor without lawmakers’ involvement.

And it delves into a contentious debate over utility-scale infrastructure siting. Indiana doesn’t have standards statewide, so it’s up to each of the 92 counties.

Will Flanders, the research director at the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, also said the utilities’ estimates undervalue the benefits that community solar can add.
Duane Hinchley, a Cambridge dairy farmer, said community solar is an “innovative solution” that can give farmers a stable income to hedge against the risks in the agriculture business.
Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) said repeatedly he didn’t understand how the program would work for the utility companies.
To me, there’s plenty of need for solar.” If the utility companies won’t support a community solar proposal, Spreitzer wondered, what do they need from the Legislature to encourage more solar development?","A Wisconsin Senate Committee held a public hearing Tuesday on a bill that would allow private companies to construct small solar projects on underutilized farmland and commercial rooftops across the state.

The bill, which would encroach on the monopoly the state’s existing utility companies are allowed to maintain under state law, is being considered while people across the country worry about rising energy costs amid a boom in the construction of data centers and the increased use of electric vehicles and appliances.

Environmental groups in the state have also regularly complained that the utility companies aren’t constructing enough renewable energy projects or sunsetting existing coal and natural gas power plants quickly enough.

The bill, authored by Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) and Rep. Scott Krug (R-Nekoosa), would allow people in Wisconsin to subscribe to get some of their power from a local “community solar” installation. The subscribers would receive credits they can put toward their utility bill. Because the power developed at the local solar installation will still need to travel through the utility company’s infrastructure, the bill includes a provision that all subscribers to the program would have to pay at least $20 per month on their electric bill.

In the hearing of the Senate Committee on Transportation and Local Government, the bill’s authors said allowing community solar projects would increase people’s energy choices while allowing the expansion of solar power in the state that avoids the objections from local residents that often come with large, utility-scale solar projects.

“This change will open a new market sector in a high energy industry, attract economic investments in Wisconsin, create local jobs, drive innovation and competition, and ultimately save consumers and small businesses money on their energy bills,” Testin said.

But the authors also acknowledged there is still a lot of disagreement over the details and the bill is not yet in its final form.

“We’re not exactly there yet. We’re not all agreeing on this being the best way forward just yet, but this public hearing is a really important step to vet that out a little bit more to get us closer to that answer,” Krug said. “So yes, there are still some kinks to work out between the utilities and individuals who want a more market-based approach to solar. I hope we can work through those issues here.”

Over the hearing’s three and a half hours, the testimony split among two groups — the utility companies who are opposed to the bill and a coalition of solar companies, economists, farmers and employers who are in favor.

The utility companies accused the bill of creating a “shell game” that would lower the costs for the subscribers of a given project while raising electric bills for everyone else. Zack Hill, testifying on behalf of Alliant Energy, said the utility estimated that community solar would result in an additional $8.75 billion in costs for ratepayers over the next 25 years.

“How does [the bill] pay for subscribers 10 to 20% energy savings? The short answer: It will shift costs to your other constituents,” Hill said. “Some have said this sounds like community solar voodoo economics, but all you have to remember is this, when a company promises you a discount, someone else has to pay for it.”

People in favor of the bill argued that the generation of more energy could only help lower energy costs while disputing the utility companies’ claims. Will Flanders, the research director at the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, also said the utilities’ estimates undervalue the benefits that community solar can add.

“This is a model that expands energy choice without large subsidies, without mandates, without turning more power over to monopoly utilities,” Flanders said. “In fact, it introduces competition at a time when Wisconsin needs it the most.”

“We argue that community solar can deliver net savings to the entire system,” he continued. “When we talk about a shell game, what we’re really saying is there’s no real additional resources being put into the system, but obviously there is additional resources being put in when we have these with these programs in place.”

Karl Rabago, a Denver-based energy consultant who testified with Flanders, said that the Alliant $8.75 billion estimate amounted to a threat that if the utilities don’t get to sell the energy, they’ll charge consumers for that loss.

“No one knows where this number comes from, but having seen how utilities make their case in other states, I am 99.9% confident they are basically saying, ‘If we don’t get to make the electricity and sell it, we could potentially lose $8.75 billion and and if we don’t make that money, we’re going to charge you for it anyway,’ and that’s how customer costs could go up,” Rabago said. “That’s the most likely explanation for a histrionic number. The utility position, to summarize, seems to sound a bit like ‘let us do it all and no one gets hurt.’ We’ve heard those kinds of exhortations. Monopolies do it particularly well.”

Toward the end of the hearing, a number of Wisconsin property owners testified, touting the benefits they’ll receive if they’re able to allow solar projects to be constructed on their land.

Duane Hinchley, a Cambridge dairy farmer, said community solar is an “innovative solution” that can give farmers a stable income to hedge against the risks in the agriculture business. Plus, he said, allowing farmers to participate will prevent land that has been farmed for generations from being developed into subdivisions.

“With the right policies in place, our state’s proud agricultural heritage can be a cornerstone of Wisconsin’s clean energy future,” Hinchley said.

But throughout the day, lawmakers from both parties appeared skeptical of the bill’s benefits.

Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) said repeatedly he didn’t understand how the program would work for the utility companies.

“It sounds like a shell game to me,” he said. “I just, I’m really having a challenge with trying to figure out how that would work, because it would seem to me that the energy company, the regulated company, is the one that’s going to be footing the bill for this.”

Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) questioned how the program wouldn’t eventually raise energy costs for non-participants, but said one selling point for the bill was that it would encourage the increased development of renewable energy.

“I heard you say this is going to force more solar to be built, whether or not you need it,” Spreitzer said to a utility company representative. “And I guess that, to me, is the one selling point of the bill. Is that I look at where we’ve been in the landscape lately, where we have, unfortunately, federal incentives for solar that are going away. We have increasing demand for power from data centers. We’re seeing new natural gas plants get built. We’re seeing coal plants not being retired, when we hoped they would. To me, there’s plenty of need for solar.”

If the utility companies won’t support a community solar proposal, Spreitzer wondered, what do they need from the Legislature to encourage more solar development?

“And so if we’re not going to go down this route, what are the incentives that you all need to make sure that we can continue to drive solar development without increasing rates for customers and without saying, ‘let’s go build a natural gas plant instead?” he asked.

Anti-rights of nature bill

Also on Tuesday, the committee heard testimony on a bill from Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) that would prohibit local governments in Wisconsin from enacting “rights of nature” ordinances, which grant natural elements legal rights that can be protected in court.

Nass said in his testimony that the idea is anti-American and is contrary to the values of the U.S. Constitution.

“This is a radical departure from our current law. Rights are something that human beings have,” Nass said. “This concept of granting nature rights is something that has been done primarily in foreign countries … and many of these countries lean dramatically towards socialism and communism, and their attitude is not compatible with private property rights in our country.”

But proponents of rights of nature resolutions frequently point to the fact that corporations are granted rights under U.S. law. Communities including Green Bay and Milwaukee have passed or begun drafting rights of nature ordinances and some Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill that would grant Devil’s Lake State Park some rights that can be protected in court.

In a statement after the hearing, Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point), one of the co-authors of the Democratic proposal, wrote, “As we heard from advocates today, Rights of Nature is one of the strongest tools local governments have to protect clean air, clean water and healthy soil for future generations — so that our grandchildren, and their children after them, can drink our waters, eat food grown in our soils, and hunt in our forests.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hotel-Verdant-roof-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:48.426206

Each year, the group releases a state of the air report compiling data from official air quality monitors so people know what they’re breathing.
“There are air quality reports that you can look up and especially folks that have health issues, lung issues, etc.
I say we because I have asthma and I'm really thinking about that a lot when it's a poor air quality day.
You can tell really, you can tell if you go out and it's been, um, uh, like an orange or red day for air quality.","Power plants in Arkansas have received exemptions for compliance with the Enviormental Protection Agency’s Mercury and Air Toxic Standards until July 2029. Ozarks at Large's Jack Travis reports that letting these plants avoid the rules could harm public health, especially in some of the state’s lower income communities. He spoke with the director of Advocacy in Arkansas for the American Lung Association to learn more.

In March earlier this year, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin invited power plants, chemical manufacturers and other industrial polluters to apply for temporary exemptions from federal rules that limit toxic air emissions. The specific rules that coal-burning power plants were attempting to circumvent are the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS, under section one twelve of the Clean Air Act. This regulation, which the Biden administration finalized last May, requires polluters to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals like mercury, arsenic and benzene.

“So there is technically a provision in the Clean Air Act that makes this possible, but it's very, only meant to be used in very limited and specific circumstances, which is not how it's being applied.”

That’s Laura Turner. She is the director of advocacy in Arkansas for the American Lung Association, an organization that works to improve lung health through research, public education and advocacy.

The provision she’s referring to is in section 112. It allows the president to exempt certain polluters from compliance with any standard or limitation for up to two years if the technology to implement the standard is not available and it is, quote, “in the national security interests of the United States to do so.”

“And they're making it incredibly easy to get the exemptions. In fact, all a company would need to do would be email the EPA. There's an email inbox to request to be exempted. No lengthy application process or anything like that.”

So far, three companies in Arkansas received exemptions from federal limits on toxic air pollution: the White Bluff Steam Station in Jefferson County, the Plum Point Energy Station in Mississippi County, and Georgia-Pacific chemicals manufacturing plant in Ashley County. Only the former two are coal powered plants and covered by the EPA’s Mercury and Air toxic standards.

Turner says that while the MATS rule focuses on airborne mercury, other chemicals like nickel, arsenic, and lead can also come from these plants and pose equal danger.

“With all of these kind of combined…There are various health effects that can happen, including irritation of the lungs, the skin, mucous membranes. It can affect your kidneys. It can damage your nervous central nervous system, and can cause, you know, sooner, sooner impacts. Nausea and vomiting can lead to cancer as well.

“So looking at all of this long list of chemicals that are covered under this law, these different pollutants can also cause heart attacks, and developmental delays in children. That's one that you kind of hear a lot about. Especially with lead. That's one we're familiar with. And then another piece of it too is that power plants also emit fine particulate matter and gases like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon, carbon dioxide. There's just a whole spew of things that are bad for us to inhale or be exposed to. Inhaling particulate matter specifically can lead to a wide range of adverse health effects like coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, which is kind of really relevant to what we do here in healthy adults and also result in asthma attacks with people of any age.”

She says industrial polluters typically operate in rural or densely urban areas. This causes specific populations to bear the effects of unhealthy air disproportionately.

“People of color and low income people are more likely to live in what we call fenceline communities that are most burdened by that pollution. So, and I'm sure there's a lot of history behind that that we won't get into, but we know that there's already, um, yeah, that's just a higher risk. That's not necessary and a lot of times people can't afford to move away from there or maybe don't want to. So they're kind of trapped, breathing in that pollution.”

As of producing this report, some of the U.S. Census Bureau’s website is down, so gathering data from the agency is difficult. However, Data USA pulls from sources such as the Census Bureau to offer profiles on places across the country. According to their profiles on Jefferson, Ashley and Mississippi counties, all have poverty rates ranging from twenty point six percent to twenty two point seven percent — roughly double the national average.

Turner says the ALA protects clean air and helps prevent lung disease by advocating against policies like the section 112 exemptions and mobilizing local support. Each year, the group releases a state of the air report compiling data from official air quality monitors so people know what they’re breathing. They also alert volunteers and health professionals when lawmakers are taking comments on air quality rules, with Turner often testifying herself.

“So whenever those do come up and there’s a chance to do it, I try to, and sometimes you just gotta say it anyway, even if nobody’s asking for it. And then with our state of the air report, which comes out in April, we do a great deal of media advocacy around that report. And Arkansas is one where we get a lot of traction. I think usually with the state of the air report and kind of use that to draw attention to what’s going on… for better or for worse.”

Outside of the ALA’s efforts, environmental groups nationwide have filed suit against President Trump, Lee Zeldin and the EPA, challenging the legality of the exemptions and the use of the provision in section 112 to allow them. Turner says citizens at large have a voice too.

“Talk to legislators, talk to council members. In some cases, I mean, anybody can go to those organizations that regulate air quality at the state level, and anybody can go to those meetings.”

She recommends visiting the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment’s Division of Environmental Quality’s website and signing up for alerts if available — specifically with the division’s Office of Air Quality.

“Just kind of seeking those out and reaching out to the people that work there as well and letting them know you care about this. There’s no rule against that. So that’s something that I would encourage people to do. Even if you think your voice doesn’t matter. Every little voice counts. And I think more than anything, folks that are local have a very powerful opportunity to do that if they’re the ones who are having to breathe this air. Those are the ones whose opinion is the most valuable.

What's more, everyone can take small steps within their own lives to reduce pollution:

“That usually looks like trying not to drive more than you have to. Gassing up in the evening rather than during the heat of the day, especially during high ozone season, which is in the summer, and trying to use public transportation if it's available, biking if you can. We all have different options available to us. But, those are all little things we can do to fight pollution. And also just being aware of what the air quality is.”

Turner says those with breathing difficulties can acutely feel the impact pollution has on their quality of life.

“There are air quality reports that you can look up and especially folks that have health issues, lung issues, etc. we need to be really sensitive to that. I say we because I have asthma and I'm really thinking about that a lot when it's a poor air quality day. You can tell really, you can tell if you go out and it's been, um, uh, like an orange or red day for air quality. I feel it in my lungs for sure.”

“This proclamation is a strong recognition of Louisiana’s history and future as an energy powerhouse,” said Michael Hecht, President and CEO of Greater New Orleans, Inc. “Gulf Coast Energy Day honors the workers and communities behind a century of energy leadership, and it reinforces Louisiana’s role in America’s energy security and the next wave of innovation. Louisiana has led for generations and is ready to lead what comes next.”

The Governor announced the proclamation as part of his remarks during the day’s activities, which come ahead of the forthcoming Gulf lease sale on December 10, 2025, a milestone for the state and country’s offshore energy industry.

At the inaugural Gulf Coast Energy Day, attendees participated in conversations that included:

Federal activity updates from Bryan Domangue, Gulf of America OCS Region Director, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE)

State energy planning remarks from Jason Lanclos, Director of State Energy Development and Planning

An energy outlook presentation from Dr. Greg Upton of LSU

A panel moderated by Michael Hecht of Greater New Orleans, Inc., featuring Tommy Faucheux (LMOGA), Erik Milito (NOIA), Chett Chiasson (Port Fourchon), Anna Guichard (SLB), and Eric Zimmerman (LLOG)

“These lease sales put Louisiana to work and puts our state at the forefront of furthering America’s energy dominance,” said Tommy Faucheux, President of Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association. “By expanding access and supporting investment in the Gulf of America, we are creating jobs, strengthening energy security, and delivering vital funding to restore Louisiana’s coastline.”

In the proclamation, the Governor cited Louisiana’s long-standing position at the forefront of energy development, including offshore production, pipelines, refineries, petrochemical complexes, LNG export leadership, and maritime support services. The proclamation also emphasized the energy sector’s measurable economic impact, including:

306,750 jobs supported by Louisiana’s energy sector, representing 15% of total employment

$25.5 billion in annual statewide earnings, representing 19% of all wages

$77.7 billion in economic value, roughly 25% of the state economy

Significant fiscal contributions in FY 2024, including $974 million in specific state taxes, $1.1 billion in local property taxes, and $3.48 billion toward state taxes, licenses, and fees

The proclamation further detailed regional impacts across Louisiana, from the Mississippi River corridor to the Bayou region and Southwest and Northwest Louisiana, and noted that each direct oil and natural gas job generates approximately 1.8 additional jobs elsewhere in the state economy.

“Gulf Coast Energy Day highlights the women and men of the energy industry throughout the Gulf Coast who tirelessly and safely produce the energy that fuels our country,” said Erik Milito, President of National Ocean Industries Association. “The Gulf of America remains the gold standard for offshore energy: driving prolific production, supporting good-paying jobs, bolstering local and national supply chains, funding conservation programs nationwide, and anchoring U.S. energy and national security. From Louisiana to Texas to Mississippi to Alabama, the Gulf Coast leads the way.”

The proclamation also pointed to Louisiana’s competitive position as global energy markets evolve, including growth opportunities in an all-of-the-above energy portfolio, as well as a catalog of announced energy-related projects totaling $133 billion in capital expenditures that are projected to generate 34,000 new jobs, according to Louisiana Economic Development.

“Offshore oil and gas investment is a long-term play that requires certainty and stability from the federal government,” said Mike Moncla, President of Louisiana Oil & Gas Association. “We are thankful that President Trump recognizes the importance of offshore development. Offshore production represents 15% of the nation’s oil output and thousands of jobs across the Gulf Coast. It’s an honor to host the first ever ‘Gulf of America’ lease sale here in New Orleans.”

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday evening voted 399-5 to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act through September 2026, and to provide lapsed payments for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years.
“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement.
Idaho has missed out on $21.3 million, Alaska more than $12.6 million and Washington more than $14.7 million.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday evening voted 399-5 to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act through September 2026, and to provide lapsed payments for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. The vote came after a year-long campaign led by bipartisan federal lawmakers from the West.

The U.S. Senate in June unanimously voted to reauthorize the act. It now goes to the president to be signed into law.

“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I’m relieved the House has finally done its job with the long-overdue passage of my bill to return the safety net for critical services to communities that need it the most.”

Wyden co-authored the original law that provided tens of millions each year for rural schools and communities that previously benefited from revenue generated by natural resource industries on public lands. Since then, it has provided $7 billion in payments to more than 700 counties and 4,400 school districts across 40 states and Puerto Rico that have large swaths of federal land within their borders.

Oregon, where more than half of the state consists of federal land, has experienced the biggest loss of any state since the funding lapsed in 2023: nearly $48.7 million in money for rural roads, public services and schools, according to a September report from the D.C.-based Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy and think tank. Idaho has missed out on $21.3 million, Alaska more than $12.6 million and Washington more than $14.7 million.

Overall, states have lost out on more than $207 million in the two years since the act expired, the Center for American Progress found.

Twice since December 2024, the Senate has voted to renew the act in an effort led by Wyden and Idaho’s senior U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican.

But each time the Senate approved it, the House failed to take a vote. The bill lapsed in 2023 and counties haven’t gotten payments since early 2024. House Republicans most recently failed to reauthorize the act in the tax and spending cut megalaw they passed in July.

With just weeks before the House is due to wrap its work for the year, Wyden, Crapo and 83 bipartisan lawmakers from the Senate and the House sent a letter to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, urging them to take a vote on the act before they recessed.

Just 12 hours after receiving the letter, the House announced it would fast-track consideration and a vote on the bill.

Washington’s U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat representing southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, led the passage of the bill in the House.

“The Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely critical, and the passage of this legislation is beyond overdue,” she said in a statement. “Candidly, the only reason it took this long is because way too many folks in D.C. have been blissfully ignorant about how disastrous the lapse of SRS has been for timber communities in Southwest Washington and across the West. Schools have closed up, teachers have been laid off, and our kids have been left footing the bill for Congress’s neglect.”

Since the funding lapsed, schools in Skamania County in her district have laid off staff and a middle school was forced to close.

In Alaska, the failure to reauthorize the program caused rural school districts to cut their budgets, particularly in southeast Alaska, home to the vast Tongass National Forest.

Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, voted for the bill on Friday, and both of the state’s senators — Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — supported it as well.

But their advocacy may be out of step with even the most progressive members of Congress.

As data centers expand to meet the artificial intelligence boom, numerous Democratic lawmakers have expressed concerns about the climate impacts and electricity needs of the centers. But none have called for a complete moratorium on construction — indicating a potential divide between progressive advocates and those drafting legislation.

Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the ranking member on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, shrugged off the calls for a moratorium.

“They should call for an above-all energy plan that allows for the construction of renewables to play into that demand for the future,” she said in response to the progressive groups’ letter.

“We’re growing, so we need more energy sources. And the President killing energy [research and development] and killing clean energy is a big mistake,” Cantwell added.

The letter, led by Food and Water Watch and sent to Congress on Monday, cited the intense electricity and water needs of AI data centers as reason to pause construction until the regulatory landscape can be ironed out.

About 230 green groups, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, joined the call for the moratorium. The letter generally encompassed the most progressive of the green groups, without more center-left organizations.

“What we have found is that groups that are directly connected to communities on the ground that are fighting these data centers were much more willing to join together for a national moratorium as opposed to trying to stick to fighting the state, local fights individually,” said Mitch Jones, Food and Water Watch’s managing director of policy and litigation.

Jones said that the coalition has seen some interest from members of Congress in a national data center moratorium — but he declined to name specific members.

There are congressional offices interested in taking a more “regulatory approach” by adding data centers to existing federal environmental laws, Jones said.

“There is a mix of reaction on the Hill, but there is also increasing interest from members to address this issue, including going so far as supporting a national moratorium,” he said.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Commerce Committee who has long championed progressive climate policies, applauded the advocacy around data centers and their climate impacts — but stopped short of endorsing a construction moratorium.

“I’m going to continue to work with environmental groups on this looming crisis,” Markey said in an interview. “We need to have a reconciliation between the AI industry and the need for renewable energies to power that.”

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) similarly said he would not yet endorse a moratorium.

“I think my colleagues are still working their way through it. This is obviously a big proposal, and I’ve told you how I see it — I think that there has been significant abuse of taxpayer money as it relates to data centers,” Wyden said.

Among Democrats, Wyden said, there is fairly widespread worry about some of the Trump administration’s policies to speed up construction and grid connection.

“The concern about data center growth isn’t just limited to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party or to the aggressive wing of the environmental movement,” Jones said. “I believe that we will find support for this moratorium will grow from that aggressive, progressive wing, not only throughout the Democratic Party, but also across the whole political spectrum.”

There are further lines that dictate where lawmakers stand on data centers than just the political spectrum, Jones added. Geography plays a role, with members of Congress from communities with major data center growth often expressing the most worry about climate and grid impacts.

For example, Jones said, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) has slammed the unchecked growth of data centers in her state. Tlaib’s office did not respond to request for comment on whether she supports a national moratorium.

Lobbying, too, may well draw a dividing line both across Congress and within the Democratic Party. AI companies have ramped up lobbying significantly in the past year.

“Let’s be honest, we’re talking about politics — there’s always going to be money behind this as well,” Jones said.

Although a moratorium, even if it garners more congressional support, is highly unlikely to become law under Trump, Jones said that the advocacy could open new dialogue on Capitol Hill.

“We’re hoping to broaden that conversation in Congress to make sure that the communities that are really being affected by the data centers are being heard just as much as the billionaires who are benefiting from them,” Jones said.

In the meantime, Democrats have introduced more narrowly focused legislation to address the rise of data centers.

On Tuesday, Reps. Greg Landsman of Ohio and Don Beyer of Virginia introduced the “Protecting Families from AI Data Center Energy Costs Act,” which would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to meet and issue recommendations on how to protect residential rates from increasing in areas with data centers.

“The rapid growth of data center construction to meet power demands from the proliferation of AI platforms is driving electricity prices up sharply in Virginia and across the country,” Beyer said in a statement. “Our bill would respond to this growing problem to generate policy changes that protect consumers and lower prices for the American people.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/b9/63/77d3e256499aa2e326f50d8a809f/u-s-congress-18371.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:04:00.511445

Wyoming

More than 620,000 miles of barbed-wire fences divide the American West. They keep cattle contained. They’re expensive to build and expensive to maintain. A single mile of new fence line can cost a rancher $25,000. And margins in that business are thin.

Enter virtual fences and GPS collars, which some livestock managers are using on their cattle in Wyoming to manage their herds from afar, with much less need for fencing. The tech is reminiscent of the invisible fencing used by some suburban dog owners. As a cow approaches a boundary, the collar beeps. If she crosses, it delivers a mild electric shock.

Ranchers use GPS coordinates to set precise boundaries on pastures to keep cows away from streams or sagebrush. They can move cows around to prevent overgrazing. They can also monitor cows’ exact locations, and, if they see the herd bunched up, they can ride out to see if the animals are under threat from a wolf or a grizzly bear.

What is happening? Last week, Netflix unveiled an $83 billion deal to take control of Warner Bros. On Monday, Paramount tried to snatch the deal away, going straight to Warner Bros. shareholders with what it called a superior offer, one that valued the company at approximately $108 billion. Aggressive!

How is Trump responding? Either deal would need the government’s blessing. And President Trump has broken precedent by placing himself at the center of the regulatory process, our media reporter Michael Grynbaum explained. “I’ll be involved in that decision,” Trump vowed.

Paramount and Netflix have both made nice with Trump. Ted Sarandos, a chief executive of Netflix, visited the Oval Office in November, while David Ellison, the Paramount chairman, was spotted with Trump on Sunday, just hours before his company made its offer.

What could happen next? It’s possible a Paramount victory could bring the future company more in line with Trump’s views. Ellison and Trump are close, and a private equity firm founded by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, is part of the Paramount deal. The president says a Netflix win “could be a problem,” giving it too much market power. That’s Paramount’s argument, too.

Still, Trump has praised Sarandos. And while Paramount, which owns CBS, paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit that Trump brought against “60 Minutes,” Trump has continued to criticize the show. He wrote that since CBS came under Ellison’s leadership, “60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!”

Which means buying an EV in 2026 could either make you feel incredibly smart or slightly undercut.
The truth is, 2026 sits right in the middle of the EV world growing up and the EV world transforming again.","SPONSORED CONTENT

If you’ve been anywhere near a charging station, dealership, Reddit thread, or dinner table debate lately, you’ve heard the split. Half the country is convinced 2026 is finally the moment to ditch gas for good. The other half thinks you’d be crazy to buy an electric car right before the next big wave of upgrades hits.

And the argument only gets louder when you see EV owners personalizing their rides with things like the HALODISC 2 wheel cover series because EV culture isn’t niche anymore; it’s mainstream. Which makes the timing question even more important: is now the right moment to jump in?

What makes this particular year so confusing is that the U.S. EV market is moving in two directions at once. Prices are dropping, finally making EVs accessible to normal shoppers but the tech inside those cheaper cars is on the edge of a huge transition.

Charging is about to become dramatically simpler but not every 2026 model will fully benefit. Incentives are still around but fewer cars qualify than last year. It feels like standing on the edge of a big moment and trying to guess whether you’re staring at a takeoff or a turbulence zone.

And that’s why 2026 could genuinely be the best year ever to switch, or the worst.

Remember when the mythical $30,000 EV felt like Bigfoot? Everyone claimed it was coming, but you never actually saw one. That era is over. Chevrolet, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, and even Tesla are preparing EVs priced in the low-to-mid $30k range, and these aren’t compromised econoboxes. They’re real cars, with real range, built for real American families.

This is the first time U.S. buyers can look at an EV and say, “Yeah, that actually fits my budget.”

The timing is beautiful and also slightly cruel because just as these accessible models arrive, the technology underneath them is about to take a generational step forward. And as these more affordable EVs hit the market, accessories like the HALODISC 2 wheel covers allow owners to personalize their cars without spending a fortune. Whether it’s the understated RTP for a sleek, planted look or Custom Numbers for personal flair, these covers make the car feel more “yours”.

NACS Is About to Change Everything

Charging has always been the part of EV ownership that felt like a gamble. Sometimes it works beautifully, sometimes it works eventually, and sometimes it works “if you jiggle the plug and pray.”

Then came the biggest plot twist in the industry: nearly every major automaker agreed to adopt Tesla’s NACS connector.

By 2026 and 2027, new EVs from Ford, GM, Rivian, Mercedes, Honda, Hyundai, and others will plug directly into the Supercharger network, the most reliable fast-charging infrastructure in the U.S.

But this transition year is messy.

Some 2026 models will ship with NACS built in.

Some will rely on adapters.

Some won’t gain full charging access until software updates roll out.

Buy too early and you might end up with a car stuck in the “in-between” phase of America’s charging revolution.

Incentives Are Still Around… but They’re Getting Weird

Federal tax credits remain a game-changer when a model qualifies. And that’s the tricky part now. New sourcing rules have cut eligibility for several best-selling EVs, and automakers are still shuffling supply chains to satisfy requirements.

In 2026, the situation looks like this:

A car might qualify early in the year, then lose eligibility.

Another might not qualify now but will once a U.S. battery plant opens.

Some models may qualify inconsistently depending on trim.

For buyers, this means the exact same car could swing in price by up to $7,500 depending on whether you buy in January or August—and none of it has anything to do with you.

The Price War Isn’t Over Yet

Tesla fired the first shots back in 2023 and 2024, slashing prices and forcing the rest of the industry to react. Now we’re watching the next wave unfold. Automakers are preparing new battery plants, new EV platforms, and cheaper components and competition is only getting fiercer.

Some analysts think EV prices will bottom out between 2025 and 2027. Others say the bottom is already here. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Several industry forecasts expect battery costs to drop another 5–10% in 2026, which means EV sticker prices may still have room to fall—one more reason shoppers are torn between buying now or waiting.

Which means buying an EV in 2026 could either make you feel incredibly smart or slightly undercut.

That uncertainty alone is enough to keep some people waiting and others rushing to buy before the market shifts again.

So… Is 2026 the Moment or the Mistake?

If you’re the kind of driver who values stability, predictable charging, mature software, a wide selection of models, and a clear understanding of real-world costs then 2026 finally feels like the year EVs became “normal cars.” That alone makes switching attractive.

But if you’re someone who always wants the best version of whatever you buy, the newest connector, the next-gen battery, the lowest possible price, the cleaner incentives picture, waiting a year or two could easily pay off.

The truth is, 2026 sits right in the middle of the EV world growing up and the EV world transforming again. It’s a rare year where neither choice is wrong, but both require a little courage.

Are you the person who jumps now because the cars finally make sense?

Or the person who waits because the next chapter is going to be wild?

That’s the real question for 2026.",http://tflcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image1-e1764952918401.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 12:00:58.179760

Genoa and Savona, two major Italian ports, are embracing electric heavy-duty vehicles in a bid to make their logistics operations more sustainable. This landmark move comes as part of a pilot project initiated in October 2025 by LC3 Trasporti, a leader in eco-friendly transport solutions, and Costa Cruises, a giant in the cruise industry. Together, they are driving efforts to reduce emissions in one of the world’s most important transport sectors – maritime logistics.

The new fleet of electric trucks represents a giant leap toward achieving zero emissions in port supply operations, setting a clear example for others in the industry to follow.

Genoa and Savona Take Bold Step Toward Greener Ports

In the bustling ports of Genoa and Savona, where shipping and logistics are vital to the economy, the introduction of electric trucks marks a significant moment in the fight against climate change. The pilot project, launched in October 2025, is a partnership between LC3 Trasporti and Costa Cruises, aimed at reducing emissions while maintaining the efficiency of port operations.

These electric vehicles (EVs), capable of carrying loads exceeding 40 tons, are being used to supply cruise ships with essential goods, replacing traditional diesel-powered trucks. The initiative is part of a broader, long-term strategy to decarbonize the maritime logistics sector.

Zero Emissions: These electric trucks produce zero tailpipe emissions, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of port operations.

Sustainable Logistics: The move represents a shift toward more sustainable logistics practices, an essential step for reducing the environmental impact of maritime industries.

Pioneering Zero-Emission Logistics with Electric Trucks

This initiative builds on previous efforts by Costa Cruises and LC3 Trasporti, which already employed BIO-LNG-powered vehicles in the ports. BIO-LNG, a renewable alternative to traditional LNG, has been used for medium- and long-distance routes in Italy and Europe to reduce emissions from logistics activities. Now, the move to electric trucks marks a new chapter in sustainable logistics.

Key benefits of this shift:

Cleaner Air: By replacing diesel trucks, the electric fleet helps cut down on harmful emissions like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter, contributing to cleaner air in port areas.

Operational Efficiency: The electric vehicles are not just eco-friendly; they also provide operational advantages, including reduced fuel costs and lower maintenance needs compared to traditional vehicles.

Sustainability Leadership: The project positions Genoa and Savona ports as leaders in the transition to sustainable maritime logistics, encouraging other ports to follow suit.

Boosting the Green Transition in Italian Ports

The partnership between LC3 Trasporti and Costa Cruises is already showing positive results. Since their collaboration began in 2022, the companies have made significant strides in reducing CO2 emissions compared to 2018 levels. This success is a testament to the commitment to sustainability from both organizations.

Now, with the introduction of electric trucks into the port supply chain, the collaboration is expanding. The results of the initial pilot project have been promising, leading to plans for increasing the use of zero-emission vehicles in the coming years.

Key Achievements in Emission Reduction

Here are some of the significant results from this collaboration:

Reduction in CO2 emissions: Compared to 2018 levels, the use of BIO-LNG and now electric vehicles has helped cut emissions significantly, showcasing the potential of green logistics in maritime operations.

Electric Vehicles in Action: The electric trucks in operation are setting a benchmark for other ports, demonstrating how large-scale logistics operations can be greener and more efficient.

Scaling Up for a Sustainable Future

The pilot project launched in Genoa and Savona has set the stage for broader adoption of electric vehicles in the port supply chain. Following the success of this initiative, the companies are now looking to expand the use of electric trucks across additional Italian ports. The ultimate goal is to integrate these vehicles alongside BIO-LNG-powered trucks to create a fleet that is completely sustainable.

As the demand for greener solutions grows, LC3 Trasporti and Costa Cruises are committed to continuously improving their logistics services and introducing innovative, low-emission technologies that will ensure a sustainable future for the industry.

Long-Term Strategy: The companies plan to scale up the use of electric trucks and other sustainable transport solutions over the next several years, further reducing the environmental impact of port logistics.

Collaborative Success: This initiative demonstrates how collaboration between industries can achieve significant sustainability milestones, providing a model for other companies to follow.

The European Commitment to Decarbonization

This pilot project also aligns with the European Union’s ambitious goals for decarbonization. The EU aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, and these efforts in Genoa and Savona ports are helping Italy and the broader European region work toward these targets.

By investing in zero-emission technologies, both LC3 Trasporti and Costa Cruises are actively contributing to the EU’s sustainability goals and helping shape the future of green logistics across the continent.

Key European benefits:

EU Green Deal: The introduction of electric trucks in Italy’s ports supports the EU Green Deal, which seeks to make Europe the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

Market Leadership: By leading the way with electric vehicles in the logistics sector, Italy is setting an example for other countries within the EU and beyond, showing that sustainable logistics solutions are not only feasible but also effective.

Looking Toward a Greener Future for Ports

The move to electric trucks in Genoa and Savona ports is just the beginning of a larger movement toward sustainable maritime logistics. As the partnership between LC3 Trasporti and Costa Cruises expands, so too will the use of electric vehicles in Italy’s maritime sector. With each successful step, these companies are reinforcing their commitment to sustainability and green logistics, providing a roadmap for other industries to follow.

With this bold initiative, both Genoa and Savona ports are now recognized as leaders in green logistics, setting a precedent for ports around the world to follow in their efforts to reduce emissions and improve environmental responsibility.

With March being the least windy month in Germany since records began in 1950, wind power output, on the other hand, faced a drop of 5.2 percent compared to 2024.
Germany therefore must stay the course on expanding renewable power sources.
Frithjof Staiß, head of research institute ZSW, said the strong growth of renewable power sources despite a difficult economic environment showed the sector’s robustness.
Researchers from the government-backed Ariadne research project likewise warned against creating obstacles for a sustained rapid expansion of renewable power capacity.","Renewable energy sources covered nearly 56 percent of Germany’s gross electricity consumption in 2025, according to preliminary figures by energy industry group BDEW and research institute ZSW. Despite a “historically weak” first quarter of the year for wind power production and a significant drop in hydropower output, the share of renewables grew by 0.7 percentage points compared to the previous year thanks to an increase in installed solar power capacity.

Solar power output increased by 18.7 percent over the whole year, while the strong growth in installed capacity from previous years could be sustained, with more than 17 gigawatts (GW) added to the system. With March being the least windy month in Germany since records began in 1950, wind power output, on the other hand, faced a drop of 5.2 percent compared to 2024.

However, stronger winds in the second and third quarter compensated for much of the early-year decrease. Onshore turbines with a capacity of 5.2 GW were added to the grid, a marked increase from the 3.3 GW in the previous year. Due to significantly less precipitation this year compared to 2024, hydropower output dropped by nearly one quarter (24.1%), while remaining only a fraction (3.2%) of total renewable power output.

“The energy transition is the foundation of the adaptability and resilience of our economy,” said BDEW head Kerstin Andreae. Germany therefore must stay the course on expanding renewable power sources. However, in order to back up intermittent renewable power production, auctions for gas-fired power plants and a capacity market were urgently needed, she added.

Frithjof Staiß, head of research institute ZSW, said the strong growth of renewable power sources despite a difficult economic environment showed the sector’s robustness. “But uncertainty about future regulation is growing,” Staiß warned. He urged the government to provide clarity on the support framework for individual technologies, which he said would also accelerate the country’s green hydrogen plans.

Researchers from the government-backed Ariadne research project likewise warned against creating obstacles for a sustained rapid expansion of renewable power capacity. This would result in higher power prices as well as increased dependence on gas-fired power production and electricity imports. The researchers reacted to the government’s monitoring report on the energy transition released in September, which had found great uncertainty regarding projections for the growth of the country’s electricity demand. A slower-than-expected increase is possible, the report showed.

However, to conclude that this allowed for slowing down renewables expansion would be wrong, the Ariadne resesarchers said. Even if reduced support for new wind turbines and solar panels allowed the state to save money, total system costs would increase due to higher consumer prices, they found in a scenario modelling exercise. Moreover, expanding renewables at a slower pace would also lead to higher emissions and put the country at risk of missing its climate targets, they added.

Instead of enabling a longer use of fossil energy sources, policymakers should aim to push flexibility technologies, such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, or batteries. In combination with renewables, these would allow power system costs to fall while maintaining a viable emissions reduction pathway, the researchers said.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-12-10 12:02:05.896656

On Wednesday, the Houston-based company said it closed a Series E funding round led by a new investor, B Capital, a global venture capital firm started by Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin. With the latest announcement, Fervo says it’s raised about $1.5 billion overall since 2017 as it develops what could become the world’s largest ​“enhanced geothermal system” in Utah.

“Fervo is setting the pace for the next era of clean, affordable, and reliable power in the U.S.,” Jeff Johnson, general partner at B Capital, said in a news release.

The Series E funding comes as Fervo reportedly prepares to become a publicly traded company, which would let it raise even more capital for its ambitious projects. When asked about a potential IPO, Fervo said only that the company is ​“focused on executing our development plan” in an email to Canary Media. ​“We have a lot of capital needs going forward to fuel our planned growth and will be tapping a lot of different opportunities to make that happen.”

Fervo is part of a burgeoning movement in the U.S. and globally to unleash geothermal energy in many more places.

The carbon-free energy from deep underground is available around the clock, but it represents only about 0.4% of total U.S. electricity generation — largely because the existing technology is constrained by geography. Today’s geothermal plants rely on naturally occurring reservoirs of hot water and steam to spin their turbines and generate power, which are available in a limited number of places.

Fervo’s approach involves creating its own reservoirs by fracturing hot rocks and pumping them full of water. The company uses the same horizontal drilling techniques and fiber-optic sensing tools as the oil and gas industry in an effort to reach deeper wells and hotter sources than is possible with conventional geothermal technology.

Its flagship development, Cape Station, is well underway in Beaver County, Utah. The project’s initial 100-megawatt installation is on track to start delivering power to the grid in October 2026, which will make it the first commercial-scale enhanced geothermal project to hit such a milestone worldwide, according to Fervo. An additional 400 MW is slated to come online in 2028.

“It’s very exciting to see at this point in time, because of the tangible progress that has been made,” Sarah Jewett, Fervo’s senior vice president of strategy, told Canary Media. ​“It’s really looking like a power project out there” in Utah, she added, noting that an electrical substation and three power facilities now sit alongside the drilling equipment and well pads. About 350 people currently work at the site.

Fervo has already completed a pilot project in Humboldt County, Nevada. The 3.5-MW facility went online in November 2023 and supplies power directly to the Las Vegas-based utility NV Energy. Google, which backed the project, also joined the Series E as one of Fervo’s new investors.

The financing announced this week will enable the startup to continue building Cape Station and to start development on other project sites where Fervo is conducting rock and soil analyses, Jewett said. One of the new projects will be in Nevada, where Fervo is working with NV Energy and Google to develop 115 MW of geothermal energy that will power the tech giant’s data centers. But the startup isn’t ready to disclose more details on the other locations.

Ford CEO Farley said the Renault partnership will complement its existing one with Volkswagen.","Renault will jointly develop small, cheaper electric vehicles for Ford for the European market and will also team up to produce commercial vans to cut costs and fend off rising competition from Chinese rivals, the companies said on Tuesday.

“We know we’re in a fight for our lives in our industry,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told reporters in Paris on Monday ahead of the announcement, when describing Ford’s response to the threat posed by cheaper Chinese competition. “There is no better example than here in Europe.”

Europe’s traditional automakers face an influx of Chinese rivals from BYD to Changan and Xpeng.

Filling A Gap on The Lineup

As part of the Ford-Renault partnership, the first of two planned small EVs – to be produced at a Renault plant in northern France – will reach European car showrooms in 2028. They will be smaller than any Ford plans for the U.S. market and fill a gap in the automaker’s lineup, Farley said.

The two automakers will also jointly develop Renault and Ford brand vans for Europe.

In a client note, Oddo-BHF analyst Michael Foundoukidis wrote that the deal allowed Renault to offset its fixed costs and generate revenue while offering “a capital-efficient route to market for affordable EVs” for Ford.

“More broadly, this partnership underscores the growing necessity for ‘pragmatic cooperation’,” between traditional automakers to counter lower-cost Chinese competition, he wrote.

A Powerhouse for Light Commercial Vehicles

“Together we can create a powerhouse of LCV in Europe that would be very difficult for the Chinese to compete with,” Farley said.

Although there are few Chinese brand vans on sale in Europe, Farley said the two companies “compete with them directly every day” in emerging markets.

“The Chinese will come soon and that’s why I don’t want to wait,” said Renault CEO Francois Provost.

The partnership was formed after a Renault team visited Ford’s Detroit headquarters in March. Both Farley and Provost said the two automakers do not plan to merge.

Ford’s share of the European passenger car market has almost halved in Europe from 6.1% in 2019 to 3.3% in the first 10 months of this year as it has pulled back from passenger vehicle sales. As part of a series of restructurings, the company has cut jobs and this year closed its Saarlouis plant in Germany.

Given the withdrawal of EV support from U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, the No. 2 U.S. automaker faces the dual expense of investing in combustion-engine models and expensive new EV technology.

Using Renault’s EV platforms with Ford designs should help the U.S. automaker to compete in Europe’s electric car market against traditional automakers such as Volkswagen VOWG.DE as well as the Chinese.

Ford already produces two EV models in Europe on a Volkswagen platform and makes vans with the German automaker. Ford CEO Farley said the Renault partnership will complement its existing one with Volkswagen.

The French automaker also develops vans with Nissan and Volvo Group.

Europe’s Smallest Mainstream Automaker

Renault is Europe’s smallest mainstream automaker and does not sell vehicles in China or the United States – the world’s two biggest car markets – so the Ford partnership boosts its manufacturing scale to lower costs.

The French carmaker is actively seeking partnerships to make fuller use of its factories and reduce the burden of developing new EVs.

In 2026, Renault will produce two vehicles using platforms from China’s Geely in Brazil and is in talks with more automakers, including China’s Chery 9973.HK, to jointly produce and sell cars.

“Our ambition … is to show that in Europe we can produce EV cars in Europe as competitively as anyone, including the Chinese,” Renault’s Provost said.

Dec 10 (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump’s freeze on approvals for major onshore wind and solar projects is leaving thousands of megawatts of clean power capacity in limbo at a time of soaring demand for electricity, a Reuters review of permitting data and interviews with industry officials shows.

Just one solar project has been approved on federal lands since Trump took office in January, and none have been permitted since July when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered that all new decisions related to renewable energy projects require his personal sign-off.

That compares to 13 solar and two wind projects approved on public lands under former President Joe Biden.

Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has promised to fast-track energy infrastructure to meet rising electricity demand from artificial intelligence ‍and data centers, declaring an “energy emergency” to keep the United States competitive. But that policy excludes wind and solar projects.

The bottleneck extends to renewable projects proposed on private and state lands too, because they often require federal permits for wildlife or water impacts or access roads, according to developers and government officials.

Reuters examined permitting databases maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior and spoke with 10 industry representatives for this story.

Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie said it has identified 18 gigawatts of solar projects on federal lands that were canceled or are inactive due to limited development progress since the start of the year.

“It’s extremely detrimental to our industry because it just upsets the ability to deliver projects,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, which estimates that more than 500 solar and storage projects are threatened by the freeze.

Last week, more than 100 solar companies penned a letter to Congressional leaders urging them to revoke the Interior Department policy, which they said amounted to a near moratorium on new permits.

“It is difficult to understand how these actions align with the President’s stated goals of unleashing American energy and ensuring energy affordability,” three Democratic senators, Michael Bennet, John Hickenlooper and Ben Ray Lujan, said in a letter to Burgum last month.

U.S. electricity demand is expected to increase 32% by 2030, with ‌data centers accounting for more than half that growth, according to an analysis by power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies.

An Interior Department spokesperson defended its approach, without confirming the details of the Reuters reporting. “The Department continues its ‌heightened oversight of wind and solar projects on public lands and waters to protect America’s national security and critical infrastructure,” the agency said in a statement.

The freeze of onshore projects has been happening quietly in the background of the administration’s very public assault on offshore wind, a nascent industry in the U.S. that has been hit with stop-work orders, funding cancellations and revoked approvals for fully-permitted facilities. A federal court ruled on Monday that the administration’s suspension of leases and permits for new wind projects was illegal.

Trump has repeatedly argued renewable energy sources like solar and wind are too expensive, receive unfair subsidies, and are less reliable than fossil fuels because they depend on the wind blowing or the sun shining.

Instead, the administration has moved aggressively to expand fossil fuel production, accelerating leasing for oil, gas and coal projects, and ordering a cut in permitting timelines for fossil energy projects and mines to no more than ​28 days.

“President Trump’s energy dominance agenda unleashes our abundant resources like oil and gas, positioning the United States to win the AI race while simultaneously lowering energy prices and increasing grid efficiency,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email.

CLOUDS OVER NEVADA

Nevada, with its sun-soaked deserts, has emerged as the epicenter of the permitting slowdown, with more than 33 gigawatts of solar and battery storage projects on or adjacent to federal lands in various stages of development, according to Republican Governor Joe Lombardo.

Lombardo warned in an August letter to Burgum that federal delays threaten supplies to NV Energy, the ‍state’s top power provider, and may hinder mining and data center expansions.

The solar projects named by Lombardo are being developed by divisions of NextEra Energy, Korea’s Hanwha and Japan’s SoftBank.

“Nevada ​remains committed to an all of the above energy strategy that includes responsible solar development,” Lombardo said in a statement to Reuters.

NextEra and SB Energy both declined to comment. Joo Yoon, the CEO of Hanwha development arm 174Power ​Global, said several of its projects are suffering from federal permitting delays, “and we are making every effort to resolve these matters in any way possible.”

An NV Energy spokesperson confirmed discussions with the Interior Department are ongoing but did not elaborate.

In October, two months after Lombardo sent his letter, the Bureau of Land ‍Management canceled the environmental review for Esmeralda 7, a proposed complex of seven solar farms spanning 62,000 acres near Tonopah, Nevada.

The agency said developers may reapply individually.

The stakes are high for communities like Boulder City, a Las Vegas satellite community, that relies on revenue from solar projects on city-owned land. Leases on existing projects generate $21 million a year, or nearly 40% of the city’s operating budget, according to city officials.

Two new developments – Hanwha’s Boulder Solar 3, and Scout Clean Energy’s Boulder Flats – would add another $3 million annually. But both projects are waiting for a final sign-off from the Bureau of Land Management because a transmission corridor is under federal jurisdiction.

“They do not communicate with us,” Brok Armantrout, Boulder City’s revenue contracts manager, said of the city’s inquiries to BLM staff. “Even though the field office is here in Las Vegas, they’ve given us email addresses promising updates. And crickets.”

Scout Clean Energy, a unit of Brookfield Asset Management, declined to comment.

FREEZING WIND

Delays are rippling across the west.

In California, power provider San Diego Community Power renegotiated a supply contract for the 400-megawatt solar-plus-battery Purple Sage Energy Center project in Nevada in May after delays pushed its timeline back by a year, ‍according to documents and video from an agency board meeting.

“There has been no movement or guidance from the Bureau of Land Management on review timelines,” SDCP’s director of power contracts, Kenny Key, told Reuters in a statement.

The project’s developer, Primergy, a division of private equity firm Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, had no comment.

Federal authorities also missed permitting deadlines for EDF’s 300-megawatt Bonanza Solar, a Nevada project that has a contract to provide power to two Los Angeles-area cities, Pasadena and Azusa, according to a federal permitting website.

And in September, Idaho Power asked the state’s utility regulator to cancel a 300-megawatt, 35-year ‍contract with NextEra’s planned Jackalope wind project in Wyoming, citing federal permitting delays. A spokesperson declined to comment.

Wood Mackenzie has ‍said federal permitting hurdles, combined with tariffs, could lower its U.S. onshore wind installation forecast by 22% through 2029.

Other agencies have also stepped up scrutiny of permits for wind and solar facilities, including those on private ​lands.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which issues permits to projects that impact streams or wetlands, announced in September it would prioritize projects that generate the most energy per acre to comply with Trump’s emergency ​declaration.

Sprawling wind and solar projects ⁠generate less power per acre than gas or nuclear plants, and have spawned criticism about aesthetics, threats to property values and the environment. But they are also faster and cheaper to build than ‌alternatives like natural gas or nuclear power plants, according to the investment bank Lazard, which conducts an annual analysis of the cost of generation technologies.

The Army Corps said it has about 37 pending applications for solar and wind projects and added that applying the new policies should not meaningfully delay permit reviews. A spokesperson did not say whether any permits had been approved this year.

In another sign of obstacles now facing wind and solar development, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service restricted access to an online planning tool that developers of all kinds can access to quickly determine if a project overlaps with threatened species, migratory birds or their habitats and evaluate a facility’s impacts.

A notice posted on the website states that “solar and wind projects are currently not eligible to utilize” the tool until they are reviewed by Interior officials.

A service spokesperson said the change would improve coordination and create a faster and more predictable process. The agency did not say whether it was currently issuing permits to wind and solar projects. It does not maintain a public permitting database.

Renewable energy project proponents are now left wondering how long planned facilities can survive the stonewalling.

“When is the next presidential election?” Armantrout said when asked how long Boulder City is planning for the stoppage to last. “I know that’s a flippant answer, but ⁠it all depends.”

Nonprofit name

Kalamazoo Climate Crisis Coalition (KCCC)

Year formed

Our team formed in 2019 and we obtained 501(c)3 status in 2022

Mission & population served

Our mission is to mobilize collective action to achieve immediate and drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and rapid adoption of renewable energy through a transition grounded in social, racial, economic, and environmental justice.

We are committed to the work of a better climate future for our community, specifically to address these inequities: high energy costs and increasingly chaotic weather mean many of our neighbors struggle to afford needed home repairs and rising utility bills, often leading to an “eat or heat” dilemma; historic inequities, like redlining and decades of socio-economic challenges have led to barriers in property ownership and value, education and employment; and the preservation and efficiency upgrades of under-resourced family homes, which is one of the most impactful ways to reduce CO2 emissions locally.

At the heart of our work is a deep understanding that climate solutions must put the needs of those most impacted first. We offer programs in partnership with organizations committed to collaborating with homeowners in historically underserved areas in Kalamazoo County, including: providing critical home repairs and energy-efficiency upgrades in partnership with skilled trades experts; resource navigation leverages additional state, utility, and other public dollars to bringing more than $1M to Kalamazoo homeowners to support efficiency upgrades; workforce development training in partnership with existing programs; education to ensure those most impacted by pollution and extreme weather events have access to tools and knowledge to take action; and outreach to the community at-large by offering a book club and listening circles to normalize talking about topics that are taboo in some spaces.

The federally funded $18.9M Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Community Change Grant (CCG) we were awarded in late 2024 was terminated earlier this year, along with recipients of other organizations across the country focusing on environmental justice. This funding represented a years-long strategic investment in our community. The loss has been devastating.

However, we remain steadfast in our commitment to addressing generations-deep inequities across Kalamazoo – one home at a time – by providing critical home repairs and energy-efficiency upgrades. Each situation is unique, and may include added insulation, replacement windows, and/or a new HVAC system, ultimately reducing homeowner utility costs, increasing comfort, and making homes more adaptable to extreme weather events. More efficiently functioning homes lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Every energy efficiency measure gets us closer to driving real, impactful emissions reductions of atmospheric CO2 on a community scale.

We aim to increase the labor force skilled in green trades by supporting capacity building for existing workforce development programs. Workforce training programs can provide career pathways that break cycles of economic instability and address widespread shortages of skilled laborers for high-demand, good-paying jobs essential for Michigan’s infrastructure and economic future.

Through outreach and education, we are assisting homeowners and contractors in navigating options for tax incentives and rebate programs. For the community at-large, we continue our six-years-running program, Climate Conversations (formerly Fridays for Future), with a variety of guest speakers on issues relating to climate change. The Climate Change Book Club, offered in partnership with Western Michigan University, meets virtually every month. Our Ardea Youth Climate Leaders (YCL) program just graduated the fifth cohort in August. This youth-led initiative empowers high school students to become informed, confident and effective advocates for climate action. We are pleased to offer periodic in-person and virtual Climate Cafés in collaboration with the Michigan Climate Action Network to provide spaces for deep listening and normalize the feelings we experience in this time of multiple cascading crises.

The robust cross-community collaborations that were formed in preparation for the EPA CCG award remain, and today we are at nine partnerships. We will continue to strengthen and expand on those as project needs arise.

Impact story

Despite the devastating loss of our $18.9M Community Change Grant, our staff, board and all-volunteer Coordinating Committee scaled back planned outcomes to reframe the work and keep going. We remain deeply committed to our environmental justice priorities, and continue to pursue raising the funds required to provide critical home repairs and energy efficient upgrades. Collaborating with homeowners and contractors to secure resources for tax incentives and rebate programs remains a critical part of our work, and we are pursuing grant funding to help with this navigation service .

Our all-volunteer team formed in 2019 to plan and participate in a day-long series of events in observance of a global climate strike. It feels important to call out a few of the many accomplishments we have achieved since then, including securing formal climate emergency declarations from five local municipalities, establishing over 40 affiliate members from faith, education, business and environmental organizations, launching numerous education offerings, and obtaining grant awards.

Great British Energy, the government’s state-backed renewable energy company, has been allocated £700 million for UK clean power manufacturing operations.
In its Clean Energy Jobs Plan, which was released after the committee report finished collecting evidence, the government announced unspecified funding for Local Net Zero Hubs to map clean energy skills and jobs with local authorities.
It also announced £2.5 million in funding across 2025-26 for regional programmes in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire to support clean energy jobs.","The UK could gain between 135,000 and 725,000 jobs from the energy transition by 2030 with the right policy, planning and skills programmes, according to a new report from the government’s Energy Security and Net Zero committee.

The “Workforce planning to deliver clean, secure energy” report said that the UK’s energy transition will create “winners and losers” in the workforce, as energy sector businesses move their operations away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon technologies, but that there is scope for “smart policy and expenditure” to harness opportunity.

In October, energy secretary Ed Miliband announced the Clean Energy Jobs Plan, aiming to make the UK “the winner in the global clean energy jobs race”. The plan introduced a range of measures on employment, regional powers and workers’ rights, along with £1.2 billion per year to support skills development.

The report highlighted the importance of transitioning skills from traditional energy sectors into the burgeoning clean energy economy. It said that the government must “tackle barriers preventing existing energy sector workers transitioning successfully”. Most prominently, North Sea oil and gas workers have become an emblem of the energy transition’s impact on jobs. Trade union Unite recently called the government’s North Sea Future Plans for workers “tinkering around the edges”, which lacks a reliable skills transition.

The Energy Security and Net Zero committee’s report said “many of the skills of the existing energy, engineering and construction workforces are highly transferable”, and called on the government to expand Skills Passports and associated funding to enable skills transfers between sectors. It also called for “tangible workforce transition and support targets” and measures to “leverage UK manufacturing content requirements where possible”.

The government’s Clean Energy Industries Plan, published earlier this year, said that the solar PV and storage industries are “vital” to the country’s industrial transition, alongside frontier industries like wind, nuclear and carbon capture and storage. Great British Energy, the government’s state-backed renewable energy company, has been allocated £700 million for UK clean power manufacturing operations.

The UK may need to import “specific skills” from overseas in the short term to meet decarbonisation targets, the committee argued.

The report also called for greater power for devolved governments and measures to transition local workforces. “National workforce planning will need to be delivered beyond Whitehall,” it said, and said delivering workforce change may look different in different local circumstances. It said that these differences should be considered “while providing both a consistent quality in career pathways, standards and training and a portability of skills across the UK’s nations.”

Statistics from big-four consultancy PwC showed that Scotland led the UK in clean energy jobs as of November 2024.

Now the organization is calling attention to the environmental impacts of the pipeline company that brought it to court and won a $345 million judgment.

A new report released Wednesday identifies oil spills, gas releases, air pollution and other incidents at Energy Transfer’s web of pipelines and infrastructure nationwide, including subsidiaries and joint ventures. More incidents occurred in Texas, where Energy Transfer is headquartered, than any other state, according to the report.

The report, titled Bad Neighbor, follows a March 2025 jury verdict that found Greenpeace USA liable for damages during protests against Energy Transfer’s Dakota Access pipeline. Greenpeace calls the case a strategic lawsuit against public participation, or SLAPP, designed to silence criticism of the company. Greenpeace’s report on Dallas-based Energy Transfer summarizes public information on the company’s environmental record and calls for defending the rights to protest and free speech.

“Greenpeace’s bread and butter has always been exposing and bearing witness to air pollution, water pollution, the climate catastrophe, and the impacts on people and ecosystems,” said Tim Donaghy, the report’s author and Greenpeace USA’s research director. “This is what Greenpeace was built for.”

Energy Transfer denies that the lawsuit aimed to stifle free speech. In a statement, the company called the guilty verdict “a win for all the law-abiding Americans who understand the difference between the right to free speech and breaking the law.”

In its report, Greenpeace referenced what it called four “major disasters” associated with Energy Transfer and its affiliates since September 2024, including two in Texas and one offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Greenpeace also reported that of the 300 spills on pipelines owned by Energy Transfer and its affiliates between 2018 and 2025, almost two thirds occurred in Texas. The report said that Energy Transfer’s vast network of infrastructure in the Permian Basin is emitting millions of metric tons of greenhouse gases a year.

The report does not attempt to compare Energy Transfer to other companies, but shows the wide impact of one company that holds a large market share. Energy Transfer transports approximately 30 percent of U.S. natural gas and 40 percent of U.S. crude oil production.

Energy Transfer has been fined more than $100 million by federal, state and local regulators over the last three decades, according to the report. Greenpeace argues this is a “cost of doing business” for a company that in 2024 reported annual revenue of $80 billion.

“There is something wrong with a system that lets polluters off the hook but penalizes those who oppose them,” the report said.

“We are aware of the report, which recycles publicly available information in an attempt by Greenpeace to manufacture headlines,” Energy Transfer responded in a statement. “Furthermore, to intentionally misrepresent the data, the report falsely attributes to Energy Transfer issues with pipelines in which we hold only passive ownership, and which are operated by other companies.”

In the report, Greenpeace explains its methodology in detail. The report includes pipeline incidents from joint ventures where Energy Transfer is not the pipeline operator, but the company holds a greater than 25 percent interest. Greenpeace also included incidents for subsidiaries where Energy Transfer is the pipeline operator.

“Energy Transfer has a complex corporate structure that has changed significantly over time,” the report states. “The latest 10-K for FY 2024 lists over 400 named subsidiaries and several joint ventures. This makes the compilation and interpretation of past events complicated.”

Greenpeace on the Offense

Energy Transfer brought its suit against Greenpeace in 2017, alleging the organization defamed the company while supporting protesters who damaged property. Earlier this year a North Dakota jury found Greenpeace liable to pay $667 million in damages to Energy Transfer. In October, a judge cut that amount to about $345 million.

Post-trial motions are ongoing. Greenpeace spokesperson Madison Carter said the nonprofit plans to ask for a new trial if the court issues a final judgement that does not satisfy the organization. If that fails, Greenpeace can appeal to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

Greenpeace USA’s Donaghy said that the lawsuit goes beyond the defendants.

“If people don’t feel free to speak out against those who are polluting their air and water, and whose business model is driving us towards climate collapse, then what chance do we really have in enacting solutions to these problems?” he said.

Greenpeace said it compiled the report using public databases and records, which lawyers and fact checkers reviewed. It was also shared with Energy Transfer before publication.

Energy Transfer is primarily a pipeline company, transporting oil and natural gas from areas of production to facilities where it is processed and refined. The company has also expanded into the liquified natural gas industry and has extensive offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Greenpeace said it relied on Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) data to compile liquid spills and releases of hazardous gas.

Between Jan. 1, 2018, and June 30, 2025, Energy Transfer and its affiliates, joint ventures and subsidiaries, including Sunoco, reported 300 spills of hazardous liquids, or one every nine days, according to the report. Nearly 250 of those spills involved oil, totalling 31,860 barrels, or 1.34 million gallons.

“Fossil fuels are inherently polluting and it does seem that oil spills are continuously happening,” said Donaghy. “If you look at the data collected by PHMSA and across the industry, there’s just a drumbeat of small spills and large spills over time.”

During the same time period from 2018 to 2025, Energy Transfer and its affiliates reported 126 natural gas releases, according to PHMSA data cited in the report. More than 5,000 million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas were released in these incidents.

In Energy Transfer’s 2024 Corporate Responsibility report, the company said the total number of hazardous liquid accidents off its property decreased 21 percent from 2023 and were down 31 percent from the five-year average.

The largest gas releases occurred on the offshore Sea Robin gas pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico in two incidents in January 2025 and a third in May 2025, according to the report. The three leaks released a total of more than 3,000 MMcf of gas. All three incidents are among the five biggest gas releases reported to PHMSA by any company since 2010, according to the report.

An explosion at Energy Transfer’s Justice pipeline in Deer Park, Texas, on Sep. 16, 2024, was the largest release of hazardous liquids that Energy Transfer has reported to PHMSA since 2018, federal records show. More than 38,793 barrels of highly volatile liquids, which include natural gas liquids, were released.

The explosion occurred when a car slammed into a pipeline valve in the Houston suburb. The vehicle was engulfed in flames and the driver died on the scene. The death was later ruled a suicide.

Four people were injured and five homes were damaged, according to local news reports. A shelter-in-place order covered more than 1,000 nearby homes, businesses and schools.

Months later, the Railroad Commission of Texas, the state’s oil and gas regulator, reported that it had found no safety violations at the pipeline and would not issue fines.

The fire burned for more than three days as the pipeline depressurized. Energy Transfer reported releasing 18,312 pounds of nitrous oxides and 383,214 pounds of volatile organic compounds.

Air Alliance Houston, a nonprofit focused on the health impacts of air pollution, called for a better accounting of the incident and improved communication with local communities.

“There is a risk that comes with having pipelines in densely populated areas,” Inyang Uwak, the organization’s research and policy director, told Inside Climate News. “There can be fires and explosions that result in air pollution and chemical exposure.”

Uwak, an epidemiologist, added: “Pipelines are often considered a low-risk method of transporting hazardous compounds. However, accidents do happen, and we need to proactively prevent these accidents, particularly with above-ground pipelines.”

Energy Transfer added new concrete barricades around the pipeline valve site after the incident, according to Railroad Commission documents.

Katherine Culbert, a process safety engineer in Houston, said it raised a “red flag” that the Railroad Commission said it found no safety violations after investigating. Culbert is running for the Republican nomination for a seat on the Railroad Commission.

“I have worked for pipeline companies,” she said. “Every company has something where they could improve. If people are dying, there is something that could be done to make it better.”

Railroad Commission spokesperson Bryce Dubee said that less than half of 1 percent of reported hazardous liquid incidents were caused by vehicle damage. “Whatever the cause is, we thoroughly investigate each incident,” he said.

Energy Transfer’s largest crude oil spill since 2018 occurred on May 5, 2025, in Arlington, Texas, according to the Greenpeace report. The spill released a reported 6,600 barrels, or 277,200 gallons, of oil underground. The oil entered a broken sewer pipe and flowed to Fort Worth’s Village Creek wastewater treatment plant a few miles away. Oil appeared in several areas of the treatment plant and a popular birding area was closed. Cleanup costs were estimated at $5 million.

The report goes on to document greenhouse gas emissions from Energy Transfer’s operations in the Permian Basin, worker safety violations and other lawsuits that the company has brought challenging the constitutionality of pipeline safety enforcement.

“We’re not able to say if Energy Transfer is worse or best [among pipeline companies],” said Greenpeace’s Donaghy. “But we can say that their operations are causing impacts for communities, and that makes them a bad neighbor.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2172868791-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 09:00:37.708336

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) is pulling out familiar and some new tools to spark interest in the Model Y as the year winds down. With only a few weeks left in 2024, the company is offering 0% APR financing for up to six years, along with free color and interior upgrades that normally add $1,000 to $2,500 to the price. Buyers considering the Model 3 can also get financing at 2.99% APR, a significant drop from typical rates.

The push comes at a moment when the loss of federal tax credits has made electric vehicles less affordable for many shoppers. Still, the incentives gave the stock a lift, with shares rising nearly 2.5% on Tuesday as investors welcomed signs that Tesla is working to protect delivery volume.

Even so, the broader landscape remains challenging. In Europe, Stellantis is teaming up with ride-hailing company Bolt to introduce driverless vehicles to a massive customer base a move that could crowd Tesla's position in autonomous driving. Ford has also stepped up its efforts, calling the current period a fight for survival in the EV market.

The European Commission has unveiled an EU Grids Package, a set of legislative and policy measures to modernise and expand Europe’s electricity grids. The Package is a crucial step to make energy more affordable and secure for households and industry. It addresses long-standing bottlenecks in grid development. It proposes new rules for grid planning and permitting. And it sets out a vision for a more integrated, resilient, and future-proof energy system – based on high shares of wind.

Today the European Commission presented an EU Grids Package. It aims to boost investment in Europe’s grid infrastructure, strengthen interconnectivity, and support the EU’s energy security and competitiveness goals.

Grids are the biggest bottleneck to new wind energy projects. Europe needs to invest €584bn by 2030 to upgrade its grid infrastructure. But grid investment has long fallen short.

This underinvestment leads to curtailed renewable electricity and higher energy bills. It undermines Europe’s energy security. WindEurope’s latest study shows that a renewables-based energy system will save Europe up to €1.6tn, as compared to four alternative energy system scenarios, even when you factor in grids and system integration costs.

“Grids are vital to Europe’s energy security and competitiveness. A renewables-based energy system will be much cheaper for Europe – even when you factor in the additional costs for grids, storage, and electrification. But you can’t have more renewable electricity without more grids. The EU Grids Package will enable faster permitting, better planning and increased investment certainty”, says Giles Dickson, WindEurope CEO.

What it means for wind

Today wind energy is 20% of all electricity consumed in Europe. It will be 34% by 2030 and more than 50% by 2050. But Europe is not building enough new wind. Around 500 GW of wind energy projects are currently waiting for grid connection permits. The system is clogged up; authorities are overloaded.

To resolve this issue, the EU Grids Package recommends a shift from today’s “first come, first serve” principle to “first ready, first serve”, including new filtering criteria and project milestones. This new approach will help prioritise viable projects and filter out speculative “zombie projects”. This increases the visibility for permitting authorities and allows viable projects to move forward faster.

“We have entered a new age of electricity”, Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera explained, presenting the Package. Europe is set to ramp up the share of electricity in its total energy consumption, from below 25% today to 50% by 2040. This requires a totally different approach to grid planning.

The Package proposes better top-down grid planning. The Commission will take on a bigger role: it will create a forward-looking scenario for Europe’s Ten-Year Development Plan (TYNDP), in line with the EU’s 2040 and 2050 objectives. Europe’s transmission system operators will then base their planning on this new scenario. A new “infrastructure needs identification report”, drafted by ENTSO-E will identify present and future gaps and investment needs.

The Package will ensure grid investments mobilise both public and private finance. On the public side, the EU is scaling up its support for energy infrastructure in the next EU budget, including with a 5-fold increase in the Connecting Europe Facility. On the private side, the EU will launch a new Clean Energy Investment Strategy in 2026. It will propose concrete private sector actions, including from institutional investors, as well as support from the European Investment Bank (EIB).

The Package also aims to scale up Europe’s grid equipment supply chain. It proposes the establishment of a new platform for EU distribution network planning to track distribution grid related-manufacturing needs. Next year’s revision of the Public Procurement Directives will further strengthen Europe’s manufacturing base for grids technologies “made in Europe”.

Finally, the Package recognises offshore grids as a new priority. It contains new initiatives and rules around cross-border grid planning and cost-sharing. Next to that, the Package proposes new “Energy Highways”, key grid projects, such as cross-border interconnectors and offshore hubs.

Accelerating permitting

The Package tables a permitting acceleration directive which will involve tweaking various directives, including the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the Electricity Market Design Directive (EMD). The targeted Commission proposal contains important improvements, for example on the permitting of repowered wind farms, storage units and hybrid power plants.

“The Grids Package proposes a targeted and well-balanced revision of existing permitting rules. Good. But well-intended attempts to accelerate permitting must not end up undermining investment security. And they must not undermine public acceptance either. Stick to the sensible and targeted measures proposed by the Commission. And otherwise focus on implementing the Renewables Directive rules that are not being tweaked,” says Giles Dickson.

The Package includes further improvements to permitting, such as the option to introduce “positive silence” to speed up permitting decisions, a toolbox for public inclusion, and the application of “overriding public interest” to Projects of Common Interest (PCIs).

The Package asks Member States to establish a single digital portal at national level for all the steps of the permitting procedures for renewable energy, storage and grid projects. All document submissions and communication between project developers and authorities would take place on the portal. This marks a breakthrough in the digitalisation of permitting and could make paper-based applications obsolete.

Next steps

Electricity grids are the backbone of our energy system. They connect countries and allow electricity to be transported to where it is needed. The EU Grids Package sets out a clear vision for a modern, integrated, and resilient grid infrastructure that can deliver on the EU’s energy security and competitiveness goals.

Many elements of the Grids Package come in the form of recommendations to Member States. National implementation will be crucial. WindEurope stands ready to work with EU Member States and industry partners to make Europe’s grids fit for a future energy system based on high shares of wind energy.",https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/Grids-europe.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:07.955785

STOCKHOLM, Dec 10 (Reuters) – Leaders from across Europe’s electric car industry on Wednesday urged the European Commission to stick ‍to its 2035 zero-emission target for new cars, warning that any retreat would undermine investment and widen the bloc’s gap with China.

The EU executive is set to unveil an automotive package on December ‌16 that could give more flexibility ‌on CO2 targets and ease an effective ban on new sales of combustion-engine cars from 2035, something being pushed by German automakers and the European Automobile ​Manufacturers’ Association.

In an open letter to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, campaign group ‍E-Mobility Europe and ChargeUp Europe, ​backed by nearly 200 signatories such ​as Swedish automakers Polestar and Volvo Cars, called ‍for the targets to be kept.

“We are deeply concerned about recent efforts to dilute your objectives,” the letter said, referring to intense lobbying efforts by the wider auto industry.

The groups added ‍that reopening the door to transitional technologies such as plug-in hybrids and CO2-neutral fuels would create uncertainty ‍and slow ‍the shift to electric vehicles, even ​as Chinese electric automakers streak ahead ​and ⁠cut costs.

“Every delay in Europe only ‌widens the gap with China,” it added.

After announcing it will back over 1,000 local and community energy projects over the next five years, the company has increased renewable funding for the UK’s devolved nations by £12 million to over £21 million.

It follows an initial pledge of £9.3 million for the devolved governments to use for renewable energy schemes and solar panels on public sector buildings.

The Scottish Government is receiving a further £5.5 million from Great British Energy and is today announcing 23 new projects, partially backed by both the new funding and Scottish Government investment. Together they will have offered funding to 71 community projects across Scotland this year – from a community solar farm on the Isle of Arran to wind farms in Aberdeenshire.

Meanwhile Great British Energy is backing the Welsh Government with an additional £6.6 million, with more than £2.8 million announced in March, to fund solar panels for schools, leisure centres and museums across Wales, as well as supporting the Welsh Government’s new Ymestyn scheme that will help public sector and communities to complete projects such as solar canopies and battery energy storage.

And in Northern Ireland Great British Energy will help the Further Education Colleges to benefit from clean energy, through installation of Solar PV at a number of sites.

UK Government Minister for Energy Michael Shanks said:

Great British Energy is empowering communities in every nation of the UK to take a stake in their own energy.

This is our clean energy superpower mission in action – putting communities in the driving seat of energy generation and making sure working people and local businesses profit.

Great British Energy CEO, Dan McGrail, said:

Communities are at the heart of our clean energy future. By increasing our support for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Great British Energy is ensuring that communities benefit directly from the transition to renewables – through lower bills and greater energy security.

This funding will help unlock hundreds of projects that will not only provide clean energy to communities but also help accelerate our mission to make the UK a clean energy superpower.

Welsh Government Cabinet Secretary for Climate Change, Huw Irranca-Davies, said:

We are driving towards a net zero public sector by 2030, and this funding will help us get even closer.

Thanks to this funding, organisations across Wales will see their energy bills falling in a matter of months.

Climate Action and Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said:

Community-led energy projects are at the heart of Scotland’s journey to net zero. By empowering local groups to generate their own clean energy with local solutions, we are not only cutting emissions but also reducing costs and creating resilient communities. These projects show what can be achieved when people come together with a shared vision for a sustainable future.

This funding is giving communities the tools and confidence to take control of their own energy needs, keep money circulating locally, and build a fairer, greener economy.

Scotland’s transition to net zero must be inclusive and fair, and community energy is a vital part of ensuring that everyone benefits from the opportunities of a clean energy future.

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

Wales is at the centre of the UK’s clean energy industry which is already delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future.

This funding from GB Energy, which includes solar panels in public buildings across Wales, will bring lower bills as well as help our drive towards energy security.

The funding marks progress in Great British Energy and government’s Local Power Plan that will ensure the benefits of the government’s clean power mission are felt at a local level across the UK, with energy security, good jobs and economic growth – while also helping to rebuild the nation’s public services.

It follows a £255 million investment to roll out solar panels for 260 NHS sites and over 250 schools as well as military sites in England, helping to cut bills for frontline services, as well as £10 million in grant funding for England’s Mayoral Strategic Authorities to deliver local clean energy projects, announced earlier this year.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:11.020960

But its real purpose is creating emissions-free energy to power an electric vehicle through an innovative process involving ammonia.

A few miles away in Shed 5 in Detroit’s historic Eastern Market, Civilized Cycles founder and CEO Zach Schieffelin tools around in an electric tricycle pulling a small trailer that carries as much as 800 pounds of cargo.

Neither is a fanciful science project. They are finalists in the global three-year, $9 million Toyota Mobility Foundation Sustainable Cities Challenge aimed at “helping cities move more safely, inclusively, and sustainably.”

The challenge is sponsored and organized by the Toyota Mobility Foundation, or TMF, which was established “ to create a truly mobile society that will help people live better lives no matter where they are,” as stated by Akio Toyoda, foundation board chairman on the organization’s website.

Partnering with the TMF are Challenge Works and World Resources Institute.

Launched in 2023 with a call to cities looking to address mobility issues, the following year, three cities were chosen from a shortlist of 10 to host what are called “city challenges” to tackle specific sustainability issues:

Venice, Italy: Increase the use of existing low and zero-carbon transport modes

Varanasi, India: Create innovative, data-driven solutions that make crowded areas of Varanasi's old city of Kashi safer and more accessible for all.

Detroit, Michigan: Demonstrate solutions that decrease fossil fuel use and reduce costs of freight operations in Detroit’s Eastern Market.

Founded in 1891, the Eastern Market is a bustling 24-acre urban oasis that typically draws thousands of shoppers searching for fresh produce, meat, flowers, treats and meals along with artwork, crafts, clothing and music.

All that merchandise has to be moved in, out and between the market’s storefronts and sheds and other hard-to-access downtown destinations.

“Through the challenge we want to understand, for example, current freight patterns, look at ways to reduce emissions, test solutions that support Eastern Market’s long term health,” said John Daly, Toyota Mobility Foundation program manager, in an interview.

Neology and Civilized Cycles are two of four companies participating in the Detroit challenge and vying for larger shares of the prize money.

The other two are Electricfish Energy Inc. and Orange Sparkleball Inc.

Using different technologies, both are addressing the Eastern Market’s goal of cleaner mobility as a way of demonstrating a broader practical uses for their innovations.

For Switzerland-based Neology, it’s all about finding a safer way to create and transport hydrogen to power electric fuel-cell vehicles through a process called ammonia decomposition, or cracking. It uses a catalyst and heat to decompose the ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen.

The advantage, explained Maroonian, is, it solves the issue of storing and transporting highly flammable hydrogen, a major impediment to wider adoption of fuel cell vehicles which emit only water vapor.

The only substance transported is more stable ammonia.

“I think that could be one of the game changers in enabling hydrogen to change, actually, the way we store it, and we actually, in our process, what we're saying you never see hydrogen. So when you need it, you produce it. When you don't need it, you skip it.” said Maroonian.

Aside from providing clean energy with less concern about storage and transportation, Maroonian also touts a considerable cost savings pointing out four times more energy density per volume compared to hydrogen in high pressure, reducing moving costs 30%-40%.

Already awarded some funds from the challenge, Maroonian is hoping to win even more to expand Neology as a provider of hydrogen for fleets operating fuel cell vehicles, and in particular, to Detroit and its Eastern Market.

“The reason why I’m extremely excited with Detroit Sustainable Cities Challenge is, first, here is the mobility town. Mobility needs to change or bring this hydrogen to the market,” said Maroonian.

Civilized Cycles tackles the clean mobility issue by swapping out gasoline or diesel-burning delivery vans for three-wheeled electric Semi-Trikes that can transport modest loads, pollution-free.

“They've used it for moving whiskey from the distillery factory that's outside the market, into their retail facilities on market, and we are starting fairly shortly, a bunch of demonstration projects, where we are picking up compost,” said Schieffelin. “We're picking up recoverable food for, like, food pantries and for doing deliveries, all mostly going downtown, but not 100% downtown, from Eastern Market, from existing vendors who are currently using cars and trucks to do those deliveries.”

Like Neology, Civilized Cycles has been awarded some funding to help finance its efforts and Schieffelin is hoping to add more units to his fleet and expand his business should the company win further funding.

Eastern Market director of programs Brandon Seng is very encouraged with what he’s seen so far. Given the market’s unique set-up, he knows what works there won’t work everywhere else, but it’s worth giving ideas a try, explaining, “That's really what we're trying to do, is see what works and how we can move things a little bit more efficiently and a little bit more environmentally friendly, and hopefully all these things knit together into something that's a little bit more sustainable moving forward.”

Indeed, the city of Detroit was anxious to join the challenge for the express purpose of accelerating development and experimentation with mobility innovation at the Eastern Market and beyond.

“The Sustainable Cities Challenge gave us an opportunity to give Brandon and Eastern Market kind of a glimpse of the future, and that allows us to have better dialog with a different vocabulary about what future funding should go to and where we should be focusing. Because otherwise, you know, this would all be theoretical,” noted Vincent Keenan, head of innovation engagement for the office of mobility innovation, office of the Mayor of Detroit, in an interview.

The challenge concludes in March when up to three winners in each of the three cities will be announced, with the remaining funds divided between them to continue their work, according to Daly.

In the case of Detroit’s Eastern Market, the goal for Daly and the Toyota Mobility Foundation, the real prize from the challenge will be shared far beyond the Motor City, declaring, “We're really hoping that it enables Eastern Market in the city of Detroit, to be able to be able to eventually achieve a goal of being thought leaders in an area that that multiple cities across the country, across the globe, are struggling with clean freight innovation. How can we do it in a responsible way? Well, we may not have all the answers, may not have all the innovation, but it's a start.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/69387b4f93006cc434e86b6f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-10 07:59:04.475488

Thoughts of running out of battery in the middle of nowhere or waiting hours at a slow charger may give pause to even the most seasoned road-trippers. But the good news is that with a bit of strategic planning, cross-country EV travel can be just as smooth, and even more enjoyable and cost-effective, than traditional gas-powered journeys.

Below are expert tips to help you minimize charging stops, avoid range anxiety, and make the most of your trip.

Gas Stations Are Everywhere, Chargers Aren’t (Yet)

Gas stations have been a part of U.S. infrastructure for over a century. There are more than 145,000 gas stations across the country, and they’re located in virtually every town, off every freeway exit, and often within a few miles of each other. They’re easy to spot, often with large signs and consistent branding.

In contrast, while the number of EV chargers is skyrocketing, with over 65,000 public charging stations and nearly 170,000 charging ports in the U.S., they’re often tucked away in parking garages, behind buildings, or in hard-to-spot locations, such as hotel lots or the back corners of shopping centers. Unless you’re using a dedicated app to guide you, they can be tough to find.

Coastal states such as California, New York, Oregon, and Washington are leading the charge in electric vehicle adoption and public charging infrastructure development. Others, particularly in the Midwest, South, and parts of the Mountain West, still have limited access to reliable public EV charging. So, depending on where you are going, there may be lots of chargers or they may be hard to find.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center offers an Electric Vehicle Charging Station Locations map, which helps you locate electric vehicle charging stations throughout the United States and Canada. This tool is useful for identifying areas where EV charging is scarce.

Use a Route Planning App or Built-In EV Navigation

Many newer EVs come with built-in navigation systems that automatically calculate charging stops based on your vehicle’s range and your selected destination. For example, EVs with Google Maps integration, such as those from General Motors, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, can automatically route you through the nearest fast-charging stations.

Keep these on your phone:

PlugShare: Crowdsourced database of nearly all chargers, with reviews, photos, and filter options.

A Better Route Planner (ABRP): Custom route planning with charging stops tailored to your vehicle.

Google Maps now shows EV chargers, and some locations list the real-time availability and speed of the chargers.

Always Have a Backup Plan and Range Cushion

Even with a carefully planned route, things can go wrong: chargers may be out of order, temporarily offline, or occupied. That’s why it’s smart to consistently identify a secondary charging station near each planned stop, preferably within a 10- to 15-mile radius.

Also, leave yourself a range buffer; don’t aim to arrive at a charger with 1% battery remaining. Weather, traffic, or terrain (like unexpected hills) can impact range. Having a cushion of at least 20–30 miles can be the difference between reaching a charger and getting stuck on the roadside.

Download EV Charging Apps and Sign Up

Unlike the standardized experience of gas stations, EV charging infrastructure is still maturing, and it’s split among various networks. That means you’ll likely use chargers from several different companies during your cross-country adventure. To make this seamless, download the apps for the major charging networks before you hit the road, and create user accounts with a payment method stored. Keep your usernames and passwords handy.

Key apps to have on hand:

Electrify America

ChargePoint

Blink

EVgo

Most mobile apps show real-time charger status, availability, and even user reviews.

Lack of Universal Charging Standards

While the recent push toward adopting the North American Charging Standard (NACS) is helping to simplify things, the charging ecosystem remains fragmented. Teslas use NACS, some vehicles use CCS, others use CHAdeMO, and not every station supports every plug type. Tesla’s Supercharger network has traditionally been limited to Tesla drivers (although that’s changing). If you’re not driving a Tesla, your charging options might be more limited depending on your route.

Get an Adapter

Most EV makers offer an officially licensed and approved adapter for CCS or CHAdeMO to NACS. With these adapters, you won’t be locked out of charging opportunities. In July 2025, Honda announced that Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX owners now have access to more than 23,500 selected Tesla Superchargers across the United States with the availability of the first Honda-approved NACS-CCS DC fast-charging adapter.

Know Your EV’s Charging Capabilities

Not all EVs charge at the same speed. Some max out at 150 kW, while others can reach 250 kW or more. Knowing your car’s peak charging rate can help you avoid wasting time at chargers that exceed your vehicle’s limits. For instance, if your EV maxes out at 100kW, there’s no benefit to stopping at a 350kW charger.

Book Hotels with On-Site Charging

One of the smartest ways to simplify your trip is by staying at hotels that offer EV charging. These are typically Level 2 chargers, which can add 20–40 miles of range per hour, allowing you to fully charge your battery after an overnight stay. This approach saves you from having to make a charging stop first thing in the morning.

Apps like PlugShare enable you to filter for hotels with charging stations, and many hotel websites are now listing EV amenities directly. Some hotel chains, including Marriott, Hilton, and Best Western, have steadily expanded EV charging access across their properties. In many cases, these chargers are provided free of charge or included with your stay, adding convenience and cost savings.

Plan Stops Where You Can Eat, Shop, or Relax

Charging doesn’t have to be dead time. Many EV drivers find that stopping every few hours for a 30-minute charge lines up perfectly with breaks for meals or rest. Try to plan your stops around amenity-rich locations, such as places with nearby restrooms, restaurants, coffee shops, or grocery stores. This way, you’re not just waiting for a charge; you’re grabbing a bite, stretching your legs, or even getting some shopping done.

Some charging stations, particularly those of Electrify America and Tesla Supercharger locations, are strategically placed near retail areas and fast-food chains. But that’s not always the case, so use Google Maps or Yelp to check what’s within walking distance of the stations on your route.

You can also tweak your charging stops in ABRP or your vehicle’s navigation system. Just ensure the alternate charger is still within range and has the required charging speed.

If you can charge at level 2 during these stops, you’ll save money as it’s less expensive than DCFC (Level 3) fast-charging stations.

Make EV Road Trips Fun, Plan Ahead

Taking a cross-country trip in an electric vehicle no longer means endless anxiety about charging or limited route options. With innovative tools like route planning apps, real-time station data, and an expanding nationwide charging network, EV road trips are becoming easier, faster, cheaper, and more enjoyable than ever.

The key is preparation: plan your route with charging in mind, keep a backup for each stop, and choose places to recharge where you can relax and refuel. Stay at hotels with overnight charging and carry the right apps for your vehicle and charger access. Get an adapter if you can.

With the right approach, a long road trip in an EV can be just as convenient as driving a gas car. Not only that, but cheaper, quieter, cleaner, and more satisfying.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southtexasnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/14/d14eb52e-bf3f-5555-9d5a-d0facffe1dc9/6912518c7b185.preview.jpg?crop=1948%2C1023%2C0%2C20&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-10 12:03:22.661332

Other states and electric rates Across the border in South Carolina, Kansas-based QTS Data Center is investing $1 billion to build a nearly 5.3 million-square-foot data center campus on 400 acres in York County.","Duke Energy is investing billions to upgrade its power grid, in part responding to unprecedented demand expected from a surge in new data centers. The Charlotte utility giant is adamant, however, that residential customers’ bill will not grow because of those data centers.

Some experts aren’t so sure. That’s already happening to customers of other utility companies around the country, they say.

The rise of artificial intelligence that’s now commonplace is fueling the ravenous power needs of data centers around the Carolinas and nationally. Domestic energy usage by data centers is expected to double or triple within just three years, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

So how is Duke Energy handling those needs?

The company is adding 13 gigawatts (GW) of capacity over the next five years, with a total cost between $95 billion to $105 billion, CEO Harry Sideris announced during a November earnings call. The plan is across all of Duke Energy’s six-state market, including the Carolinas.

That 13 GW is equal to having capacity to power about 2.3 million homes annually.

The long-term goal, detailed in Duke Energy’s 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan, involves modernizing power generation by both adding more clean energy sources and expanding capacity and efficiency in its electric grid infrastructure. That plan includes new substations and transmission lines in the Carolinas.

The costs cited by Sideris are higher than the $83 billion grid modernization plan through 2029 the company had announced in February.

Locations for some of these potential investments are in “preliminary evaluation,” said Duke Energy spokesman Garrett Poorman. He noted that the company’s most significant proposed projects are publicly shared prior to evaluation by the N.C. Utilities Commission, often including local public hearings.

Top NC leaders fighting Duke Energy rate hike

Duke Energy Carolinas covers the western half of the state, including Charlotte, and serves about 2.9 million residential customers. Progress operates in the eastern half, including the Triangle region, serving 1.8 million customers. Both companies also serve parts of South Carolina.

Combined, the utilities serve over 4.7 million customers.

In mid-November, Duke Energy proposed an approximately 15% rate hike for its nearly 5 million customers with Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The rate increase would occur between 2027 and 2028, if approved by state regulators.

But top N.C. leaders objected to that rate hike last week.

Attorney General Jeff Jackson said he was intervening in the rate request before the Utilities Commission to “ensure it is necessary.” Gov. Josh Stein quickly backed Jackson, saying he too opposes the hike because it is “simply too high and comes as the company is also retreating on more affordable clean energy.”

Duke Energy previously told the Observer it does not make rate requests lightly, and looks forward to continuing constructive dialog with all parties as the review moves forward next year.

During the earlier earnings call, Sideris reiterated that Duke Energy is focused on ensuring all 10 million of its customers receive service at a fair price, and that “customer value and affordability remain front and center.”

“Our job is to address the needs of all customers,” Sideris said, “from large industrial customers that are competing against a global market to residential customers that are managing their household budgets.

“We’re protecting existing customers through tariff structures and contract provisions for new large load projects,” he said. Tariffs refers to the structured rates the company charges customers for electricity.

How Duke Energy plans to ensure fair power bills

Residential customers won’t be on the hook for huge data center usage, according to Duke Energy.

The company says it plans to implement new terms of service, rate structures and contracts to ensure that large-load customers cover the full costs of serving them. “These customers will pay substantial energy bills, and their rates will be continually reviewed to ensure fairness,” Duke Energy stated in an email to the Observer. “Residential customer rates are not based on proximity to large energy users.”

Duke Energy also is working to manage costs through use of AI and combining Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress utilities. If approved, Sideris said the deal would save retail customers more than $1 billion through 2038. Internally, Duke Energy has established work teams to accelerate the time it takes to meet growing energy needs, according to CFO Brian Savoy.

Just this year, the company signed electric service agreements with data centers for 3 GW, including Digital Realty and Edged, which are making multibillion-dollar investments in North Carolina to support AI infrastructure.

“We’re protecting existing customers through tariff structures and contract provisions for new large load projects,” Sederis said.

Rising electric rates

Nationally, the digital infrastructure boom risks driving up electricity prices for U.S. households an average of 8%, according to a study by Carnegie Mellon University and NC State University released in June. “Policymakers must act now to align infrastructure investment and regulation with this demand surge,” the analysis said.

Legislators and utility providers are looking to shield residents from increased electricity bills and potential blackouts amid rapid data center expansions and the infrastructure upgrades required to support them.

Residential utility bills rose 6% on average nationwide in August compared with the same period the previous year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, cited by CNBC.

Three states that climbed faster than the national average are Virginia, known as “Data Center alley,” as well as Illinois and Ohio. All have a high concentration of data centers.

In North Carolina, the Power Bill Reduction Act, passed in July, overriding Stein’s veto. It had been debated regarding its potential impact on power bills, pitting businesses and residents against each other. The bill delays Duke Energy’s interim 2030 carbon reduction goals and allows the company to charge rate-payers for new power plants before they’re built.

An analysis by N.C. State University found the bill could cost ratepayers up to $23 billion through 2050.

But Duke Energy says the bill helps lower the long-term price customers pay for new power generation, with up to $15 billion in total cost savings.

Energy demand and data centers

Understanding the full impact that surging power demands for electricity that AI-fueled tech is bringing, and its implications for data centers, is an ongoing issue.

Some experts say more power-generating capacity is critical for the U.S.

“If we can’t build the energy infrastructure, we will be really struggling to meet the hype of AI. And I think there’s a real risk that we may not be able to do it in this country,” said Robert Cox, executive director of Energy Production & Infrastructure Center and associate professor of electrical and computing engineering at UNC Charlotte. “To do AI, you need big data centers.”

There are environmental concerns to consider, in addition to power and economic ones.

To meet rising energy needs, Duke Energy wants to extend the life of three North Carolina coal-fired plants at Marshall Steam Station on Lake Norman, Belews Creek in Stokes County and Cliffside in Cleveland County.

“The carbon footprint from data centers is very large because they consume a huge amount of energy, and most of that energy comes from non-renewable resources,” said Srijan Das, a computer science assistant professor at UNC Charlotte. “So they’re creating a lot of CO2 pollution, which leads to climate change.”

Duke Energy is preparing for an additional 2 GW of new data center load across the Carolinas and secured 11 new natural gas turbines, manufactured in Greenville, S.C., to help meet demand. That amount of gigawatts is equivalent to powering about 1.5 million homes a year.

Just last year, Duke Energy officials signed agreements for 2,000 megawatts of new data centers in the third quarter of 2024, the News & Observer in Raleigh reported.

Duke Energy did not specify locations or how much of that capacity is in the Carolinas. But Savoy noted that data center developers are attracted to the Carolinas because more than half of the energy mix is carbon-emissions-free nuclear power.

Other states and electric rates

Across the border in South Carolina, Kansas-based QTS Data Center is investing $1 billion to build a nearly 5.3 million-square-foot data center campus on 400 acres in York County. Company spokeswoman Karen DiMaggio said her conclusion is that “data centers aren’t to blame for higher electric bills.

“States where the power bills are the highest are not states that have a high concentration of data centers,” she said at a Lake Wylie, S.C., community meeting in November.

The average U.S. retail price for electricity is 12.68 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Hawaii has the highest average price in the U.S., paying 38 cents per kWh.

North Carolina and South Carolina are at 11.65 cents and 10.90 cents per kWh, respectively. Still, they are higher than Virginia, with the world’s largest concentration of data centers, which is at 10.62 cents per kWh.

“We recognize that our work to provide affordable energy for customers is never done,” Sideris said. “But we are proud that average rate changes have paced below the rate of inflation over the last decade, and that our rates are well below the national average.”",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/public/latest-news/rypdrb/picture311356385/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/buck-combined-cycle-4217.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 05:59:46.530524

State-owned Power China completed the Binh Dai offshore wind power project in Vietnam in November, according to the China's official Xinhua news agency.","HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Southeast Asia is a bright spot for the embattled offshore wind industry as it reels from U.S. President Donald Trump’s push against renewable energy.

The White House's policy pivot has thrown billions of dollars' worth of U.S. offshore wind projectsinto turmoil. Industry interest and investment are looking elsewhere, and developing regions with ample wind resources, like Southeast Asia, have the most to gain from this likely reshuffling, analysts say.

Wind energy is essential to efforts to curb climate change, scientists say, as global temperatures drift perilously higher. Offshore wind, which uses turbines installed in the sea, is set to grow rapidly because it can harness stronger, steadier ocean winds to generate clean electricity, the International Energy Agency says.

Southeast Asia, with its archipelago nations, long coastlines and consistently windy seas, is emerging as one of the world’s most promising regions for this technology. As energy demand continues to rise, the Philippines and Vietnam are building policy momentum that proponents hope will spur interest across the region.

Those moves could turn Southeast Asia into a model for other developing nations seeking to use wind energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, said Rebecca Williams, with the Global Wind Energy Council.

“Asia and Southeast Asia are a beacon of hope for the industry,” she said.

Trump has actively sought to kill the U.S. offshore wind industry, one of his presidential campaign promises.

He opposes using renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes burning fossil fuels for electricity, contending that climate change is a hoax.

The White House has halted construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked and paused permits, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for wind energy and cut $679 million in federal funding for a dozen projects — a complete reversal from former President Joe Biden's Administration.

Trump’s anti-renewable energy stance has shaken U.S. confidence in offshore wind projects.

That has kickstarted an industry-wide search for other places to invest.

Globally, wind energy generation is growing, led by China. It dominates wind power installations and manufactures more than half of the world’s wind turbines. Beijing is also emerging as a quiet force in the region’s offshore wind buildout, supplying turbines and engineering expertise as countries race to tap their coastal wind potential.

“We’re seeing more governments in the Global South, especially in countries in Asia, who haven’t had that background in offshore wind, now really step up,” Williams said.

Home to half of the global population, Asia is expected to account for much of the world’s future energy demand. Yet the region still relies heavily on fossil fuels, and wind generates barely 7% of Asia-Pacific’s electricity, according to the IEA.

The 11 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, a vast region that includes tiny Brunei to populous Indonesia, have no installed wind power capacity.

So there's a lot of untapped potential up for grabs, said Amisha Patel, with the Global Offshore Wind Alliance, an organization of countries promoting offshore wind.

Trump's rhetoric is disappointing given America's vast wind potential, but it hasn't slowed global wind power developments, and ""Southeast Asia is stepping forward as the U.S. retreats,” she said.

Last month, Singapore announced a three-year plan for wind energy conferences to attract investment and become a regional hub for the industry.

“Asia is looking very, very attractive because of the momentum that we’re seeing there and the core understanding of the value of offshore wind,” Patel said.

The Philippines and Vietnam have an early advantage.

The Philippines held its first offshore wind auction in November, allowing companies to bid and compete for the right to build 3.3 gigawatts of wind farms on designated seabeds. Energy Secretary Sharon Garin said that shifted offshore wind power from “potential to reality,” with clear rules and plans for how wind farms will connect to the grid, which ports they'll use and how equipment will be moved.

“The Philippines is ready to compete for global investment,” she said in a statement.

Filipino corporation ACEN partnered with Denmark's Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners in May to co-develop the nation’s first large-scale offshore wind project, aiming for up to 1 gigawatts in the central Philippine province of Camarines Sur.

Vietnam has revived long-stalled offshore wind ambitions, issuing new rules and courting foreign investors. It revised its national power plan in April, targeting up to 17 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035, and is speeding up marine zoning rules and updating permitting procedures.

Regulatory delays led Norway's Equinor to withdraw from Vietnam in 2024, but investor confidence is slowly growing. Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners is working with state-owned PetroVietnam on an offshore wind project in south-central Vietnam and Germany’s PNE AG is planning a $4.6 billion, 2-gigawatt farm in Binh Dinh province.

Vietnam is exploring regional projects. It signed a deal in May for a transmission line to export power to Singapore and Malaysia.

China is also emerging as an important player in the region. State-owned Power China completed the Binh Dai offshore wind power project in Vietnam in November, according to the China's official Xinhua news agency. In the Philippines, Mingyang Smart Energy is exploring a 2-gigawatt project in Northern Luzon.

Extreme weather is a challenge for offshore wind, especially in the Philippines and Vietnam, which endured an onslaught of deadly typhoons this year.

But technology for disaster-resilient turbines exists, said Michael Hannibal of Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. ""Countries will just need to make sure offshore wind sites are adapted and made for the environment that they are to live with and stand in,"" he said.

Putting dollars to work

Of the total allocation this month, $463 million has come via Senate Bill (SB) 1, the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017, and $190 million from the 2021 federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).

SB 1 has invested approximately $5 billion annually toward transportation projects since 2017. It provides funding split between the state and local agencies. Road projects progress through construction phases more quickly, depending on the availability of funds, including those partially funded by SB 1.

California is expected to receive nearly $42 billion in federal infrastructure funding over a span of five years. These investments will upgrade the state's roads, bridges, rail, public transit, airports, ports, and the electric vehicle charging network.

The gold standard for American EV infrastructure

California is tearing down barriers to ZEV deployment, speeding up EV charging station installations, and deploying infrastructure in hard-to-reach and low-income areas.

While qualifying for federal ZEV incentives contributed to the sales spike this quarter, becoming an EV driver in California is increasingly getting easier. There are now over 200,000 publicly accessible EV charging stations statewide. EV chargers can be found at grocery stores, park-and-ride lots, and even gas stations, whereas shared EV chargers can be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors' offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas with some level of restricted access. This statewide network of public and shared private EV chargers is in addition to the estimated 800,000 EV chargers installed in single-family homes.

California's climate leadership

Pollution is down, and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 21% since 2000 - even as the state's GDP increased 81% in that same time period, all while becoming the world's fourth largest economy.

California also continues to set clean energy records. In 2023, the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, making it the largest economy in the world to achieve this level. California has also run on 100% clean electricity for part of the day almost every day this year.",,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:16.107092

Community solar, when implemented through a true free-market approach, can strengthen reliability, reduce costs, and open a competitive and innovative energy market in Wisconsin.","Madison, WI — In a hearing that lasted more than 3 1/2 hours, fourteen witnesses including Wisconsin farmers, contractors, solar developers, economists, and major employers testified today in strong support of Local Solar legislation (SB-559 and AB 493), highlighting how the legislation would lower energy bills for all Wisconsinites, strengthen the grid, and return decision-making power to local communities.

Wisconsin families are struggling under some of the highest electricity costs in the Midwest and need affordable, locally generated energy options. The bill creates a community solar program that allows farmers and developers to build small-scale projects (typically 20–30 acres) that neighbors can subscribe to, expanding access to solar – the cheapest form of electricity – while avoiding larger developments that sometimes face local opposition. The legislation ensures that taxpayer dollars are not needed for projects; they are funded by private dollars.

Testifiers emphasized that the proposal restores local control by shifting siting authority from the Public Service Commission to municipalities and towns, ensuring decisions are made closest to the people affected. Farmers described how the bill would create a lifeline for many family farms, allowing them to lease small, unproductive portions of land to diversify income without sacrificing productive acreage. Contractors noted that their highly skilled workers are being forced to travel out of state for community solar jobs they’d much rather do here at home.

Today’s hearing showcased the breadth of the coalition behind this measure. Supporters include major employers, health systems, builders, farmers, and clean-energy advocates — including Walmart, Advocate Aurora Health, Arch Electric, Organic Valley, Wisconsin Farm Bureau, Kohler, RENEW Wisconsin, Associated Builders and Contractors, and farmers across the state.

Witnesses agreed: Community solar puts power back in the hands of Wisconsin communities and offers a practical, affordable solution to the state’s mounting energy challenges.

The bill’s sponsors, Sen. Pat Testin and Rep. Scott Krug, underscored growing frustration among constituents who want alternatives to large solar farms and skyrocketing utility bills.

Quote from Sen. Pat Testin

“Community solar gives people the freedom to choose affordable, locally generated power while putting decision-making back where it belongs: in our communities. This bill is about lowering bills, strengthening our grid, and making sure local voices are heard in the energy decisions that affect them every day.”

Quote from Rep. Scott Krug

“Community-scale projects give our communities a say in where projects are sited, keeping land use decisions close to home while opening the door to real savings for households and businesses. This legislation delivers a practical, Wisconsin-made approach to clean, affordable energy. Today’s testimony shows just how broad the support truly is.”

Quote from Ryan Jolma, Jolma Utilities:

“I’ll be honest I wasn’t so excited about coming all the way down here from Ashland today. I’m just here for our people – I know what it would mean for Northern Wisconsin if we had the opportunity to build community solar projects here at home for good wages instead of traveling 8-10 hours a week for work in Illinois.”

Quote from Duane Hinchley, Hinchley Dairy Farm (Cambridge, WI):

“As a second generation dairy farmer in Dane County, I like that the benefits of community solar stay local, giving my neighbors the chance to subscribe to a portion of the power and reduce their electricity costs.”

Quote from Craig Bain, Farmer (Arpin / Wood County):

“The steady income from this community solar lease is what will allow me to keep the rest of my land in agricultural production. It stabilizes my business and ensures that I can pass this land on to my family, rather than having to sell it off to a developer who might pave it over for good.”

Quote from Dave Klevesahl, Farmer (Door County):

“If I was not a landowner with an opportunity to start a community solar farm and I had this opportunity to help with getting community solar farms created in Wisconsin, I would still be eager to help make it happen, because it’s the right thing to do. We need to pass community for the little guy, for the family farm to supply another clean honorable product, and for the many Wisconsinites who are tired of never ending rate increases. Community solar is the only opportunity to save real people real money on the monthly utility bills.”

Quote from JD Smith, Arch Electric:

“Over 100 of Arch Electric’s Plymouth, WI based staff work exclusively on community solar but have to go to Illinois for work. Those good jobs should be available here at home.”

Beata Wierzba, RENEW Wisconsin:

“Community solar will make affordable solar power accessible to Wisconsin families who may not have their own financing, enough sun exposure, or own their property. These medium-sized projects benefit businesses and individuals, both as subscribers saving on their electric bill, and as hosts, allowing private investment in renewable energy.”

Quote from Karl Rábago, Rábago Energy, LLC:

“Utilities have said a lot of false, scary things about the costs of this program. To set the record straight, non-subscribers will not be asked to pay for benefits that only subscribers receive. New, local, in-state generation boosts reliability and affordability for all customers—reducing charges from inflated monopoly utility spending.”

Quote from Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty Research Director, Will Flanders: “Wisconsin is heading toward an energy shortfall, and the free market offers the best path to lower energy costs. Community solar, when implemented through a true free-market approach, can strengthen reliability, reduce costs, and open a competitive and innovative energy market in Wisconsin. Greater freedom and consumer choice are essential to meet the growing demands on our electric grid, and this is a great opportunity to move in that direction.”

Quote from Bonnie Beyer, Farmer:

Our farm has been passed down with care from one generation to the next and we’d like to preserve our farm’s legacy and not sell it off. We feel a deep connection to Wisconsin agricultural heritage and we’ve turned down offers over the years from real estate developers, but profitable alternatives are needed for retiring farmers like us. But this opportunity is on hold due to outdated laws preventing us from having this option. Wisconsin has always relied on the ingenuity of its farmers…why should we stop now?”

Quote from Brandon Smithwood, Dimension Energy:

“This legislation is an opportunity to lower Wisconsin families’ energy bills when they need it the most. It’s a win for ratepayers who will pay less, farmers who could use an additional income source, local businesses who are currently sending their workers out of state, and communities that don’t have a say over utility-scale energy projects.”",https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WisPoliticsIconSocial.png,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:24.491151

The letter identifies generative AI and cryptocurrency as among the most significant environmental and social threats of this generation, citing their role in fueling an unregulated expansion of data centers across the country.

According to the letter, this unprecedented growth is driving a rapid increase in energy demand, accelerating fossil fuel depletion, polluting the environment, and overconsuming water resources. Electricity prices are soaring, and the expansion of AI infrastructure raises additional concerns about societal impacts, including job losses, economic monopolies, and broader instability.

The letter details the ""massive"" harms new AI data centers are inflicting on the US, highlighting their ""enormous"" energy consumption. Data center capacity is expected to triple over the next five years, with the new facilities consuming as much electricity as roughly 30 million households. Consequently, electricity bills have already increased by 21.3 percent from 2021 to 2024, outpacing inflation.

The rapid growth of AI data centers is also projected to strain water resources. New facilities may require as much water as 18.5 million households, primarily for cooling servers used to train large language models and generate AI outputs.

The letter states that data center plans fueling the AI and crypto ""frenzy"" are disrupting a growing number of communities across the US, threatening Americans' economy, environment, and water security. Representing the collective interests of millions of people across all 50 states, the document urges Congress to impose a federal moratorium on new data centers until ""adequate"" regulations are implemented.

Currently, Big Tech and AI companies are acting as if they operate in a lawless wasteland where scarce natural resources are up for grabs. The IT industry plans to spend a staggering $8 trillion to build new data-crunching server plants, while some proposals even suggest orbiting data centers in space – an environmentally questionable, sci-fi-esque idea.

According to Emily Wurth, managing director of Food & Water Watch, the organization behind the letter, there is now bipartisan support for significant pushback against new data centers.

""A lot of people don't see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water,"" Wurth said.",https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2025/12/2025-12-09-image-11.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:04:07.022144

In May, the coalition filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump Administration’s decision to indefinitely halt all federal approvals necessary for the development of offshore and onshore wind energy projects pending federal review. Yesterday, a federal judge in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated and declared unlawful the Trump Administration’s actions, ruling that they were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.

""I am pleased to have defeated Donald Trump’s senseless attack on wind energy,” said Attorney General Ellison. “Minnesotans are counting on our state to keep energy costs as low as possible, help create good paying jobs, and combat climate change, and wind energy is helping us achieve all those goals. In fact, wind already supplies a quarter of all electricity in Minnesota. I will continue to do everything I can to stand up to the Trump Administration when it tramples on our rights or makes it harder for Minnesotans to afford their lives.”

Wind energy is particularly important to Minnesota, where it provides 1/4th of all electricity generated in Minnesota and 3/4ths of all renewable energy generated in the state. Increased wind energy will help achieve Minnesota’s emissions-reduction goals and provide a robust contribution to the state’s economy—including meaningful jobs for a highly-skilled workforce.

Minnesota law already requires all energy utilities to supply carbon-free electricity to Minnesotans by the year 2040. In 2023, Minnesota ranked eighth in the nation in wind capacity, and yesterday’s victory will help Minnesota build on those gains.

On January 20, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum that, among other things, indefinitely froze all federal approvals needed for the development of wind energy projects pending federal review. Pursuant to this directive, federal agencies stopped all permitting and approval activities.

In their lawsuit, the attorneys general alleged that the federal agencies’ actions harmed their states’ efforts to secure reliable, diversified, and affordable sources of energy to meet their increasing demand for electricity and help reduce emissions of harmful air pollutants, meet clean energy goals, and address climate change. The agencies’ actions also threatened to thwart billions of dollars of states’ investments in wind industry infrastructure, supply chains, and workforce development.

The coalition argued that federal agencies’ actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and other federal laws because the agencies, among other things, provided no reasoned explanation for categorically and indefinitely halting all wind energy approvals. The lawsuit also argued that the abrupt halt on all permitting violated numerous federal statutes that prescribe specific procedures and timelines for federal permitting and approvals—procedures the Administration wholly disregarded in stopping wind-energy development altogether.

Attorney General Ellison was joined in this matter by the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington.",https://www.ag.state.mn.us/_Img/Logo_SM.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:28.724706

This shift represents an unprecedented energy transformation, with solar power at its core, creating a profound impact on the Gulf Coast region and setting a global example for economic diversification.

Solar Power Initiatives in the Gulf clean energy sector

The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is leading these efforts with new solar power projects and the integration of energy storage solutions. DEWA’s board of directors recently discussed plans to build a 6th and 7th phase at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. This flagship project, which aims to reach 5,000 MW by 2030 with a total investment of Dh50 billion (USD 13.6 billion), will utilize advanced photovoltaic (PV) solar technology. The success of such large-scale installations depends on a solid understanding of the basics of solar panel manufacturing.

Additionally, DEWA is advancing its battery storage capabilities. The board reviewed the construction progress of a 200 MW/400 MWh capacity battery energy storage system (BESS) at the solar park. This BESS, being built by a consortium led by China’s BYD and Strabag Dubai, is expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2025. It will be crucial for stabilizing the grid and ensuring a consistent energy supply, especially after sunset.

Oman’s Battery Storage Ventures for Gulf clean energy

Oman is also making significant strides in clean energy by focusing on battery storage systems. These efforts are highlighted by the impressive growth in Oman solar energy and storage integration. The Oman Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP) has invited bids for the construction of two large battery storage projects with a combined capacity of 400 MW/800 MWh. These projects, planned for the Misfah and Liwa areas, are part of the country’s efforts to enhance grid stability and integrate more renewable energy sources. The tender for these projects was set to close in March 2024, with the plants expected to be operational by 2027.

Saudi Arabia’s Renewable Energy Ambitions in Gulf clean energy

Saudi Arabia is rapidly expanding its renewable energy sector. Beyond projects like the 150 MW solar plant and a 50 MW/100 MWh battery storage system in Tabuk, the Kingdom is spearheading massive cross-border initiatives. A landmark joint development agreement between ACWA Power and Bahrain’s Bapco Energies will see the development of a 2.8 GW solar power plant in Saudi Arabia. This project, integrated with large-scale battery storage, will transmit clean electricity to Bahrain, aiding its national renewable energy transition. Executing such a complex venture requires deep knowledge of the entire solar panel manufacturing process.

Kuwait’s First Solar Project for Gulf clean energy

Kuwait is joining the regional shift towards renewables, with plans for its first major solar power projects. As the nation embarks on a journey to launch a 1 GW solar energy project, even larger plans are taking shape. The Al Dibdibah solar plant is set to have a capacity of 2,000 MW and will include a 500 MWh battery storage system. This project, which will be built in two phases, is expected to be operational by 2027 and will play a key role in diversifying Kuwait’s energy mix. The integration of storage here is part of a wider trend of developing large-scale solar energy and battery storage projects to ensure grid reliability.

These projects collectively represent the Gulf region’s unwavering commitment to transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. By investing heavily in solar power and battery storage, countries like the UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait are setting a powerful example for balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility. The success of this transition hinges on mastering the technology and economics, from the specific manufacturing machines used to produce panels to a detailed plant cost breakdown.

South 8 Technologies is a US startup company that has developed a liquefied gas (LiGas) electrolyte, which is designed to enhance battery performance by enabling ultra-low temperature operation, outperforming conventional liquid electrolytes, which struggle below -20° C.

The two companies’ cooperation is part of a larger aerospace initiative involving KULR Technology and NASA to develop batteries for deep space missions that can withstand the harshest environments.

Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013.
As part of the restart, Santee Cooper and its customers won’t put a single cent more into construction.
Davidson said this arrangement works differently than historical nuclear projects because it’s not just utilities and their customers putting their pocketbooks on the line.
“We’ve got to make sure that we build these power plants efficiently and at a reasonable price,” Davidson said.","A day after inking a $2.7 billion deal to lead South Carolina’s nuclear reboot, executives of a New York investment firm were in the Palmetto State to talk about what drew them to the multibillion-dollar undertaking.

Hundreds gathered Tuesday on the floor of Colonial Life Arena in Columbia to hear from South Carolina utility executives, legislators and leadership of Brookfield Asset Management — the winning bid holder selected to restart construction on two abandoned reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.

“It’s a bit of a no-brainer for us,” Mitch Davidson, a managing partner in Brookfield’s Renewable Power and Transition Group, told the crowd at the second annual nuclear summit.

In October, Brookfield, its subsidiary Westinghouse and Canada-based Cameco inked a partnership deal valued at $80 billion with the U.S. government. The companies will build 10 reactors identical to those at V.C. Summer.

South Carolina’s reactors could be the first and second on the list.

Three Mile Island restart project gets a $1 billion federal loan

“There are parts of this project that are already there, big parts that are there — equipment is there, foundations are there,” Davidson told the SC Daily Gazette. “So this seems to be the perfect opportunity for us as a start.”

The companies involved still have at least six months’ worth of engineering and financial feasibility studies to determine whether the project — a black mark on the state for nearly a decade — stands a chance of ever getting done.

“I’m not going to tell you that we’re able to do it faster. That’s all things that we have to determine,” Davidson said. “But you would think, because it’s already partially built, that you can do quicker, faster, cheaper.”

And according to the leaders of Santee Cooper, if it happens, it will be done differently this time.

“This is not going to be on the backs of rate payers. It’s not going to be on the backs of our taxpayers in the state,” said board chairman Peter McCoy, who’s led the utility since 2021.

He draws a distinction from the debacle he investigated as a House committee chairman, then prosecuted as U.S. attorney.

“This is private business stepping up, with help from the federal government,” McCoy said.

Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.

The utilities scrapped the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a megawatt.

As part of the restart, Santee Cooper and its customers won’t put a single cent more into construction. The utility will, however, retain a 25% ownership interest in the expansion should it be successful, allowing it to buy, at cost, a portion of power produced to sell to its customers.

Davidson said this arrangement works differently than historical nuclear projects because it’s not just utilities and their customers putting their pocketbooks on the line. There are more parties involved so the financial risk gets chopped into smaller pieces.

“I work with utility companies around the United States, and I would tell you that all of them are very focused on this project,” said John Cogan of Centerview Partners, financial advisors to state-owned utility Santee Cooper amid the sale effort. “They see Jenkinsville as the rebirth of the nuclear renaissance in the United States.”

And the driver behind this “renaissance,” according to the panelists, is the massive demand for electricity coming from major industrial users — namely, data centers.

“We haven’t seen load growth, like true load growth, in this country for a decade,” Davidson said. “The data centers have been the driver behind all of this. The data centers, and the size that they’re getting to today, are the genesis.”

That’s why tech giants, such as Microsoft, have taken an interest and been willing to act as financial partners in the restart of retired nuclear reactors in places such as Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island.

“We’ve got to make sure that we build these power plants efficiently and at a reasonable price,” Davidson said.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday evening voted 399-5 to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act through September 2026, and to provide lapsed payments for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years.
“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday evening voted 399-5 to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act through September 2026, and to provide lapsed payments for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. The vote came after a year-long campaign led by bipartisan federal lawmakers from the West.

The U.S. Senate in June unanimously voted to reauthorize the act. It now goes to the president to be signed into law.

“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I’m relieved the House has finally done its job with the long-overdue passage of my bill to return the safety net for critical services to communities that need it the most.”

Wyden co-authored the original law that provided tens of millions each year for rural schools and communities that previously benefited from revenue generated by natural resource industries on public lands. Since then, it has provided $7 billion in payments to more than 700 counties and 4,400 school districts across 40 states and Puerto Rico that have large swaths of federal land within their borders.

Oregon, where more than half of the state consists of federal land, has experienced the biggest loss of any state since the funding lapsed in 2023: nearly $48.7 million in money for rural roads, public services and schools, according to a September report from the D.C.-based Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy and think tank. Idaho has missed out on $21.3 million, Alaska more than $12.6 million and Washington more than $14.7 million.

Overall, states have lost out on more than $207 million in the two years since the act expired, the Center for American Progress found.

Twice since December 2024, the Senate has voted to renew the act in an effort led by Wyden and Idaho’s senior U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican.

But each time the Senate approved it, the House failed to take a vote. The bill lapsed in 2023 and counties haven’t gotten payments since early 2024. House Republicans most recently failed to reauthorize the act in the tax and spending cut megalaw they passed in July.

With just weeks before the House is due to wrap its work for the year, Wyden, Crapo and 83 bipartisan lawmakers from the Senate and the House sent a letter to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, urging them to take a vote on the act before they recessed.

Just 12 hours after receiving the letter, the House announced it would fast-track consideration and a vote on the bill.

Washington’s U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat representing southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, led the passage of the bill in the House.

“The Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely critical, and the passage of this legislation is beyond overdue,” she said in a statement. “Candidly, the only reason it took this long is because way too many folks in D.C. have been blissfully ignorant about how disastrous the lapse of SRS has been for timber communities in Southwest Washington and across the West. Schools have closed up, teachers have been laid off, and our kids have been left footing the bill for Congress’s neglect.”

Since the funding lapsed, schools in Skamania County in her district have laid off staff and a middle school was forced to close.

In Alaska, the failure to reauthorize the program caused rural school districts to cut their budgets, particularly in southeast Alaska, home to the vast Tongass National Forest.

Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, voted for the bill on Friday, and both of the state’s senators — Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — supported it as well.

Oh the irony, it burns. US President Donald Trump is bending over backwards to make solar power less accessible here on Earth, but clever entrepreneurs are simply going behind his back to harvest it from outer space. The latest example is the California-based startup Aetherflux, which has zeroed in on the ability of space solar systems to skip the long wait times for a conventional, terrestrial power hookup.

Look, Up In The Sky … It’s Galactic Brain!

Harvesting solar power for space operations is as old as the Vanguard 1 satellite, launched by the US in 1959. Solar panels in space are now as common as lambs in springtime. However, in recent years, the space solar industry has begun to branch out in new directions. Startups like Aetherflux have been racing to see who can be first to harvest solar power in space and beam it down to Earth on a 24/7 basis, regardless of the weather.

That sounds like the stuff of science fiction — and at one time, it was — but the technology pieces are in place to transfer solar power from arrays in space to Earth wirelessly, and investors are smelling money in the water. Aetherflux’s space-to-Earth solar beaming plan first crossed the CleanTechnica radar in 2024 as a self-funded project of Robin Hood co-founder Baiju Bhatt, who founded Aetherflux and serves as CEO. Earlier this year, additional investors piled onto Aeitherflux to the tune of $50 million, enabling Bhatt to lay plans for launching his first orbiting solar power plant in 2026.

In addition, the AI boom has fostered the idea of launching solar-powered data centers into space and beaming the data down to Earth. Aetherflux has that angle covered as well. On December 9, the company announced plans to launch its first commercial, solar-powered orbiting data center in Q1 of 2027. If all goes according to plan, the system will scale up by adding nodes to create a constellation.

“The project, dubbed ‘Galactic Brain,’ offers a bypass to the current five-to-eight year time horizon for data centers to be built on Earth,” Aetherflux explained, while observing that “securing real estate, establishing utility connections and constructing new data centers can take more than half a decade.”

Bhatt also chipped in his two cents in a press statement. “The race for artificial general intelligence is fundamentally a race for compute capacity, and by extension, energy,” he said. “The elephant in the room is that our current energy plans simply won’t get us there fast enough.”

“Galactic Brain puts the sunlight next to the silicon and skips the power grid entirely,” Bhatt emphasized.

Space Solar Wins The War Against Solar Power

If that sounds like Bhatt is blowing a big, fat, solar powered raspberry at Trump, well, maybe. In July, Trump directed the US Department of the Interior to stop issuing permits for solar projects on federal lands. Solar projects on land under state, local, and private ownership are also in jeopardy if they require any type of federal permit.

The situation is so desperate that 143 US solar companies banded together to plead for a policy change. “Federal agencies are implementing this directive in a way that amounts to a nearly complete moratorium on permitting for any project in which the Department of Interior may play a role, on both federal and private land, no matter how minor,” they wrote in a letter dated December 4, addressed to all members of the US Senate and House of Representatives.

“Businesses need certainty in order to continue making investments in the United States to build out much-needed energy projects,” they emphasized. “Certainty must include a review process that does not discriminate by energy source.”

Is anybody here old enough to remember that Republican members of Congress and their allies in the conserve-o-sphere roundly criticized Democrats for “picking energy winners and losers” with policies that promoted domestic wind and solar power? How the worm has turned! Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” does just that. It excludes wind and solar — and only wind and solar, among all other domestic energy resources — from federal support.

Solar Power Is Just Better, That’s All

For the record, Trump’s energy policy does support other renewables, namely biomass, geothermal, and hydropower. Even the yet-to-emerge field of marine energy somehow made the cut. However, all of these domestic energy resources face formidable obstacles to scale-up, particularly so in the near term.

In contrast, the killer combo of solar and energy storage has already scaled. Together, solar and storage are widely acknowledged as the fastest and most economical way to add more utility-sized power plants to the US.

The Solar Energy Industries Association has the numbers to prove it. On December 9, the organization issued its latest report under the title “U.S. Solar Market Insight Q4 2025,” which leads off with the observation that the US solar power profile grew another 11.7 gigawatts in new capacity in Q3, making it the third-largest quarter on record for solar activity regardless of the ill winds blowing out of the White House.

“Despite actions in Washington targeting clean energy, solar and storage account for 85% of all new power added to the grid in the first nine months of the Trump Administration,” SEIA added with a twist of the knife.

Twisting the knife further, the SEIA report shows that the vast majority — 73% — of solar capacity installed so far in 2025 landed squarely in states carried by President Trump on Election Day 2024. In particular, SEIA name-checks Texas, Indiana, Florida, Arizona, Ohio, Utah, Kentucky, and Arkansas along with Utah.

Talk about biting the hand that feeds you! If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Meanwhile, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper had plenty to say.

“Remarkable growth in Texas, Indiana, Utah, and other states won by President Trump shows just how decisively the market is moving toward solar,” Hopper said in a press statement. “But unless this administration reverses course, the future of clean, affordable, and reliable solar and storage will be frozen by uncertainty and Americans will continue to see their energy bills go up.”

That’s not to say that all solar activity in the US will grind to a halt. The new SEIA report was prepared in collaboration with the firm Wood Mackenzie, which anticipates that 250 gigawatts in solar capacity will be added to the nation’s grid by 2030, Trump or no Trump. However, that figure reflects the impact of today’s partisan politics. “The solar industry would be well positioned to meet more of this new demand if existing constraints were alleviated, presenting upside to our forecast,” explained the head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report, Michelle Davis.
